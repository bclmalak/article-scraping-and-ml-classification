"Political actors in Tanzania have in recent years demanded compensation from Germany for colonial atrocities committed in the early 20th century. In early 2017, the National Assembly of Tanzania stopped short of putting the label of genocide on the atrocities committed by German troops during the Maji-Maji uprising (1905–1907).
During a visit to Tanzania recently, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, asked for “forgiveness” and expressed “shame” for the colonial atrocities committed in what was then German East Africa. This was in reference to the killing of up to 300,000 people during the Maji-Maji uprising.
German involvement in Tanzania began in 1890 when Berlin decided to take over administration of east African territories which German traders and travellers had secured. To reduce the cost of administration, governance rested on a few German officers with unchecked power, along with African and Arab fighters (called Askari) to suppress resistance.
Abuse of power was rampant in this system, which provoked rather than prevented resistance. By the end of the 19th century, German troops had brutally quashed an uprising of the Wahehe in southern Tanzania.
In 1905, the Maji-Maji uprising began as a rebellion against Arab traders and cotton plantation owners of the south-eastern coast. Usually the insurgents would first uproot the cotton plants, and then raid farmhouses or office buildings. But the raids transformed into a peasants’ revolt as the violence progressed into the interior.
The German response was brutal and catastrophic (page 265). A three-year-long mass starvation (page 274) devastated a large part of the southern territory. Entire areas were depopulated or ravaged by disease (page 274). In one location, 25% of the women became unable to fall pregnant. As many as 300,000 people were killed.
We are widely published scholars of transitional justice and international criminal justice. Our historical and legal analysis of the suppression of the Maji-Maji uprising shows that there were indeed widespread instances of war crimes committed in the conflicts between the German military and various anti-colonial groups. It also shows that German conduct in that conflict can be described as genocidal in terms of intent and impact.
There is a nuance to our finding. We could not find any genocidal directive from the imperial authorities in Berlin. But the evidence suggests that the atrocities committed against civilians were indeed intended to destroy an identifiable group in whole or in part. This is the core element of the current definition of genocide.
Finding that the violent quashing of the Maji-Maji uprising would be regarded as genocide in the legal sense doesn’t have any practical implications, such as a legal obligation to pay compensation. Today’s international law doesn’t apply to what happened then. The implications are instead political and moral: if Germany’s colonial actions were to be regarded as genocide, the German public might be open to Tanzanian compensation claims, as they were to Namibia’s.
Suppression as genocidal violence
Many of the atrocities committed during this conflict could be construed as war crimes committed by both sides. But our focus was the possibility of a genocide.
A resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1946 noted that, historically,
many instances of such crimes of genocide have occurred when racial, religious, political and other groups have been destroyed, entirely or in part.
This resolution was precursor to the Genocide Convention of 1948. The convention defines the crime of genocide and serves as the basis for the prevention and punishment of genocide as a crime under international and domestic laws.
Under international law, the Genocide Convention and its progeny don’t apply to states or individuals retrospectively. These laws cannot be invoked as a basis for a legal claim against Germany for events that occurred in the early 20th century.
But characterising an atrocity as a genocide can serve as impetus for acknowledgement and some form of voluntary compensation.
The genocide question
We analysed first-hand archival records from Germany and Tanzania to examine whether German actions constitute genocide according to the Genocide Convention or the International Criminal Tribunals’ jurisprudence.
German documents and letters from the time rarely distinguished between ethnic groups and usually referred to “Negroes” (Neger) and “Blacks” (Schwarze) in a sweeping way. Racialisation didn’t indicate victimisation in itself, because some of these populations were regarded as friendly to the German colonial authorities.
One could conclude that the German authorities targeted their political (anti-colonial) opponents rather than a group that’s protected under the current definition of genocide. The protected groups are national, racial, ethnic or religious.
But a more expansive reading of genocide law leads to a different conclusion.
The first genocide conviction delivered by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was in the case of Akayesu. In this case the judges reasoned that the four protected groups should not be seen as inflexible categories. They stretched the limits to accommodate groups that have similar qualities to the groups explicitly protected.
Subsequent decisions by international criminal tribunals followed that reasoning. They took into account the way the perpetrator saw the group. A group protected by the Genocide Convention does not have to exist objectively. It is enough if it exists in the mind of the perpetrator and he wants to destroy it in whole or in part.
The “Blacks” the Germans had in mind when they wrote and spoke about their enemies did not exist as such a group. Instead they consisted of a plethora of ethnic groups, tribes and extended family clans. They had as much in common with each other as the Germans had with their colonising British neighbours in the Uganda protectorate.
But in the German officers’ minds these “Blacks” did exist as such a group. That is why they would have been protected if the Genocide Convention and the respective jurisprudence had been in force then.
This has relevance for the question of whether the German conduct during the Maji-Maji uprising was genocidal.
The lack of genocidal directives doesn’t imply a lack of genocidal intent. Circumstantial evidence suggests the German administration wanted to destroy not only hostile individual members of a racialised group, but the group in whole or in part.
The trial and appeals chambers of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia accepted this kind of reasoning: the basis for establishing a perpetrator’s genocidal intent does not always have to be written evidence or witness testimony. Sometimes the perpetrator’s own behaviour allows such a conclusion.
In Srebrenica it was the policy to separate men from women and children and then to kill the men in mass executions. In a patriarchal society like the Bosnian Muslims’ the whole Muslim group would not survive without its men.
We apply a similar standard to the German conduct to eradicate the traditional leaders of the communities that took part in the Maji-Maji uprising. These communities would have perished without their leaders. In some cases, they did perish. And depriving these groups of their ability to make collective decisions and to “survive as groups” (rather than as individuals or nuclear families) was the explicit aim of the German commanders.","300,000 Tanzanians were killed by Germany during the Maji-Maji uprising – it was genocide and should be called that",politics
"Each year antimicrobial resistance – the ability of microbes to survive agents designed to kill them – claims more lives than malaria and HIV/Aids combined. Africa bears the brunt of this development, which thrives on inequality and poverty. Nadine Dreyer asked Tom Nyirenda, a research scientist with over 27 years’ experience in infectious diseases, what health organisations on the continent are doing to fight this threat to medical progress.
What is antimicrobial resistance?
Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines (including antibiotics). This makes infections harder to treat and increases the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death.
In Africa, drug resistance is already a documented problem for HIV, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), typhoid, cholera, meningitis, gonorrhoea and dysentery.
How big a problem is antimicrobial resistance?
It is one of the top 10 global public health threats, and threatens to undermine years of medical progress.

Nearly 5 million deaths were associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019.
The African continent bears the heaviest burden.
The first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of antimicrobial resistance has estimated that in 2019 over 27 deaths per 100,000 were directly attributable to it in Africa. Over 114 deaths per 100,000 were associated with it.
In high-income countries, antimicrobial resistance led directly to 13 deaths per 100,000. It was associated with 56 deaths per 100,000 people.
The study showed that young children were particularly at risk. Half of the deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019 were among children under the age of 5.
How do inequality and poverty come into it?
In many African countries, poverty and inequality propel the likelihood of antimicrobial resistance.
Access to clean running water, proper sanitation and safe water management is a big challenge in many hospitals and clinics in African countries.
And there is often a dire shortage of health workers. Wards are often overcrowded. As a result, infections spread faster. Some of these infections are resistant to antibiotics.
Inappropriate use of antibiotics, inadequate health resources and limited access to the right medicines has also fuelled antibiotic resistance in sub-Saharan Africa.
Substandard and falsified medicines, due to their inferior doses, can allow bacteria to adapt, persist, develop and spread. Studies show that the African continent is affected by such medical products.
Global antibiotic shortages also encourage the use of inferior medicines.
With weak regulation, over-the-counter prescription of antibiotics is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The highest rates of over-the-counter antibiotics have been found in Eritrea (up to 89.2%), Ethiopia (up to 87.9%), Nigeria (up to 86.5%) and Tanzania (up to 92.3%). In Zambia up to 100% of pharmacies dispensed antibiotics without a prescription.
Is there any good news?
While tackling antimicrobial resistance on the African continent may be tougher than in other regions, many deaths are preventable.
There have been some encouraging moves to protect health systems and communities against antimicrobial resistance.
The African Union has established the African Union Framework for Antimicrobial Resistance Control. It aims to strengthen research; advocate for policies, laws and good governance; enhance awareness; and engage civil society organisations.
Fighting antimicrobial resistance involves developing new antibiotics and making sure they reach the people who need them. This is what organisations like the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership were created to do. We are seeing encouraging progress for an antibiotic against drug-resistant gonorrhoea, a high priority pathogen.
Six South African sites were involved in the clinical trial.
Measuring and monitoring antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use has an essential role. Here too there’s progress. The Mapping AMR and AMU Partnership consortium has recently published 14 new country reports on the situation across Africa.
The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership is funding clinical research for medical tools to detect, treat and prevent poverty-related infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. The vital field of neonatal sepsis is included.
It’s crucial to shift attitudes towards antibiotics so that they are used wisely. Organisations such as ReAct Africa and the South Centre have made good progress on this front.
They advocate for responsible use of antibiotics as well as ways to prevent and control bacterial infections.
In Kenya and other African countries, antimicrobial resistance champions raise awareness in schools, universities, clinics and communities.
A bold move by African countries to establish and expand local manufacturing of medical products requires strict regulation so that it does not fuel drug resistance with sub-standard or fake products.
What does the future hold?
The antimicrobial resistance challenges in African countries are huge. But momentum to counter it is building.
Crucial steps include:
greater investment
expansion of infection, prevention and control programmes, including good clinical prescription practices
improving access to essential antibiotics and diagnostic tools
the development of new antibiotics that can treat infections that are multi-drug resistant.

"Recent heavy downpours in the Lower Volta area of Ghana led to the worst flooding in the region’s history. The flooding was caused by a spillage (a deliberate release of water) from the Akosombo Dam, the country’s biggest hydroelectric dam. Over 26,000 people were displaced. No deaths have been officially announced. The last recorded spillage was in 2010.
The Volta River Authority, the state agency that manages the Akosombo Dam, opened the flood gates to release pressure on the dam after unusually high rainfall. By September, Volta Lake, the vast, 400km-long reservoir behind Akosombo Dam, had been filled to capacity. A month after the spillage started, communities along the Volta River were severely affected by the excess water.
Local residents fled to safety, leaving behind most of their belongings. Farms were submerged and crops destroyed. The inventory of stores and businesses in low-lying areas suffered extensive damage.
The director of the disaster management organisation was quoted as saying that the floods were caused by heavy rains in the Volta catchment basin. Climate change and global warming, he explained, were responsible for all the water coming down the Volta.
Other factors are relevant too to understand this crisis. Based on my knowledge of the area as a historian who has studied the Akosombo Dam and its impact on the lives of the people in the Lower Volta, I would attribute the extent of the calamity to two additional factors.
One is the ecological and economic changes brought by the construction of the Akosombo Dam. The areas affected by the flooding have been populated by farmers who settled there after they could no longer farm and fish elsewhere in the Lower Volta once the dam was built. The second is the failings of the Volta River Authority which manages the dam.
The history
The Lower Volta lies below the country’s two large hydroelectric dams, Akosombo, completed in 1965, and Kpong, completed in 1982.
The Volta River Project was Ghana’s largest development project. It included Akosombo Dam and an aluminum smelter as the dam’s main beneficiary. Even in the 1950s the planners of the project recognised that damming the Volta would have severe economic effects on the Lower Volta. There was also recognition that the project would lead to major ecological changes.
In its 1956 report, the preparatory commission, which closely studied the Volta River Project, detailed the changes that were to come.
The first was that the construction of the dam would put an end to the ecological cycle that had nourished the Lower Volta for centuries. The area was accustomed to substantial annual floods that filled hundreds of small creeks, fertilised agricultural lands and created large fisheries. The cycle of annual floods enabled a prosperous agricultural society with farming, fishing and clam picking (which was largely done by women.)
During the dry season, men migrated upstream to fish, hunt, farm and build boats.
Once Akosombo was built, the annual floods stopped. The dam created a regulated river downstream.
The preparatory commission warned about the radical changes the dam would bring downstream. But policymakers and Ghana’s governments ignored them.
The impact on communities of the Lower Volta has been examined by researcher Dzodzi Tsikata in her study Living in the Shadow of the Large Dams. In response to the dam being built many people migrated upstream and formed the fishing communities that now populate the shores of Volta Lake. Those who stayed and continued farming had to adapt their agricultural practices by planting in low-lying areas closer to the Volta River.
Subsequently, settlements expanded into the former flood plains along the river. These areas have now been inundated by the flooding caused by the spillage at Akosombo.

Woeful response
The current flooding raises the question of who is responsible and who must compensate those who have been affected.
According to the 1961 Volta River Development Act (Act 46), the Volta River Authority has a statutory responsibility to prevent Volta Lake from rising to a height of 85.3 metres above sea level and cresting the dam.
In addition, the Volta River Authority should prevent the “flow of water past the dam” from causing “flooding downstream from dam above the levels which were normal” prior to the construction of Akosombo.
Finally, the authority has to “take reasonable measures to give warning of possible flooding from the lake or from the River Volta downstream from the dam.”
The Volta River Authority preserved the integrity of the Akosombo Dam by opening the floodgates and spilling the lake’s excess water. But it failed in its other tasks.
It did not maintain an unoccupied flood zone which could absorb the excess water.
It failed to give people a timely warning to evacuate. The managers of the dam organised a simulation exercise for surrounding communities in May 2023.
It did not help people in the flood zones to move out of danger with their belongings.
In my view, the Volta River Authority, and by extension the Ghanaian state, have a moral obligation to compensate the people affected by the spillage and the subsequent floods.
Although the authority has income through the sale of electricity, it operated at a loss in 2022, due to increased administrative expenses triggered by inflation. The Ghanaian state is also facing deficits. So there is little certainty about whether the residents of the Lower Volta will receive compensation.
One would hope that the Volta River Authority and the Ghanaian state would finally address some of the historical injustice experienced by the communities in the Lower Volta since the early 1960s.",Ghana: Akosombo Dam disaster reveals a history of negligence that continues to this day,environment + energy
"South African higher education is plagued by inequalities due to the social and economic legacies of apartheid.
More than 50% of enrolment in higher education is from black, working-class, disadvantaged households from rural areas who depend on state-funded student aid. At the same time, some institutions of higher learning are also historically disadvantaged: they were designated for non-white students during the apartheid era. These institutions suffered discrimination, underfunding and limited resources, creating disparities in the country’s higher education system.
In a rapidly evolving digital era, one of the big questions is: can technology help narrow the gap in access to education?
During the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions had to use online modes for tutoring. Online tutoring continues to be useful in blended learning models (a combination of face-to-face and online learning). But there have been concerns that the cost of online methods might exclude students from historically marginalised population groups.
The University of the Western Cape, one of the historically disadvantaged universities in South Africa, has been experimenting with a free mobile phone messenger platform, known as Moya, to provide online peer tutoring for its large, undergraduate classes. Tutoring is defined as
people who are not professional teachers helping and supporting the learning of others in an interactive, purposeful and systematic way.
I am a scholar of information systems with a research focus on health and education. My research focuses on creating more inclusive online environments for students and patients, especially those with lower socioeconomic status.
Research on the use of mobile instant messaging has predominantly looked at small classes of fewer than 50 students. My study sought to examine the factors that influenced students’ engagement in the university’s large undergraduate classes. I wanted to establish which factors affected third-year Information Systems students’ use of a data-free instant messenger (Moya) for online peer tutoring, and what would improve their use of it.
My findings showed that the students preferred using WhatsApp – a mobile application that required them to buy data – over the one that was being offered that didn’t require data. Students believed that Moya was difficult to use and that effort was required. They said they did not know how to use Moya, despite the similarities in user interface to WhatsApp.
The results can’t be generalised to all South African tertiary institutions. Still, the key insights may be useful in other contexts where data-free mobile instant messengers are being considered.
What we found
Most of the students taking part in the study were full time (91.7%). They were predominantly young, aged between 18 and 42 (81.8%), and most used WiFi (50.8%) while 21.9% used prepaid mobile data.
Qualitative data was collected via an online survey asking three key questions: Which tool(s) did you not use in this course? Why did you not use the tools available? What would improve your use of that tool?
The study revealed several key factors that shaped students’ attitudes to and use of the data-free instant messenger for online peer tutoring.
Students did not see the need for or benefit of using a data-free instant messenger when they were already using WhatsApp.
Students’ perception of the application within their peer group influenced their decision to use it. An influencing factor was the lack of use by peers: “more people are on WhatsApp than Moya”.
Surprisingly, results showed that students had data and devices to use WhatsApp. As 50.8% of students had access to WiFi, they would be able to use an instant messenger requiring data, such as WhatsApp. A minority of students indicated that students had insufficient space to download the Moya application.
The fun or pleasure of using Moya was not evident.
Using WhatsApp was a habit and therefore was the preferred instant messenger.
We expected that cost would be a significant factor because Moya didn’t require data. In fact, students chose to purchase dedicated WhatsApp data bundles (which are less expensive than some other data) from mobile operators.
The low usage level of Moya instant messenger for online peer tutoring can also be attributed to student claims of a lack of awareness of the application.
However, in our other study where Moya was used to tutor a large class of 495 first-year Accounting students online, the outcomes were more positive. Most students (79.47%) indicated that the tutor was available and helpful. Tutors indicated that the use of voice notes assisted students in understanding course concepts. Students agreed or strongly agreed (70.2%) that the course allowed them to fully participate.
What could improve platform use
Students’ responses to the research question about improving the instant messaging varied. One recommendation (14.6% of responses) was that usage would improve if students did not have another medium, such as WhatsApp.
Usage would also improve if students did not have access to the internet or if they did not have data (10.5% of responses). A lack of access to the university’s virtual private network, which gives students internet access, would also encourage usage.
Other responses were that its use would improve if usage was compulsory and if they were provided with more information about Moya. Social influence would improve with an increased number of users, such as peers and tutors.
What’s next?
By addressing the identified challenges and building on the factors that encourage usage, educational institutions can harness technology to create a more equitable and enriching learning environment for all students. The insights move us closer to fulfilling the promise of inclusive education and empowering students for a brighter future.",A free messaging app seemed useful for disadvantaged South African students: why they didn’t agree,education
"The Great Sand Sea Desert stretches over an area of 72,000km² linking Egypt and Libya. If you find yourself in a particular part of the desert in south-east Libya and south-western parts of Egypt, you’ll spot pieces of yellow glass scattered across the sandy landscape.
It was first described in a scientific paper in 1933 and is known as Libyan desert glass. Mineral collectors value it for its beauty, its relative rarity – and its mystery. A pendant found in Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun’s tomb contains a piece of the glass. Natural glasses are found elsewhere in the world; examples include moldavites from the Ries crater in Europe and tektites from the Ivory Coast. But none are as rich in silica as Libyan desert glass, nor are they found in such large lumps and quantities.
The origin of the glass has been the subject of debate among scientists for almost a century. Some suggested it might be from volcanoes on the moon. Others propose it’s the product of lightning strikes (“fulgurites” – glass that forms from fusion of sand and soil where they are hit by lightning). Other theories suggest it’s the result of sedimentary or hydrothermal processes; caused by a massive explosion of a meteor in the air; or that it came from a nearby meteorite crater.
Now, thanks to advanced microscopy technology, we believe we have the answer. Along with colleagues from universities and science centres in Germany, Egypt and Morocco, I have identified Libyan desert glass as originating from the impact of a meteorite on the Earth’s surface.
Space collisions are a primary process in the solar system, as planets and their natural satellites accreted via the asteroids and planet embryos (also called planetesimals) colliding with each other. These impacts helped our planet to assemble, too.
Under the microscope
In 1996 scientists determined that the glass was close to 29 million years old. A later study suggested the source material was composed of quartz grains, coated with mixed clay minerals and iron and titanium oxides.
This latter finding raised more questions, since the proposed age is older than the matching source material in the relevant area of the Great Sand Sea desert. To put it simply: those source materials didn’t exist in that location 29 million years ago.
For our recent study, a co-author obtained two pieces of the glass from a local who had collected them in the Al Jaouf region in south-eastern Libya.
We studied the samples with a state-of-the-art transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique, which allows us to see tiny particles of material – 20,000 times smaller than the thickness of a paper sheet. Using this super-high magnification technique, we found small minerals in this glass: different types of zirconium oxide (ZrO₂).

Minerals are composed of chemical elements, atoms of which form regular three-dimensional packaging. Imagine putting eggs or soda bottles on the shelf of a supermarket: layers on top of layers to ensure the most efficient storage. Similarly, atoms assemble into a crystal lattice that is unique for each mineral. Minerals that have the same chemical composition but different atomic structure (different ways of atom packaging into the crystal lattice) are called polymorphs.
One polymorph of ZrO₂ that we observed in Libyan desert glass is called cubic zirconia – the kind seen in some jewellery as a synthetic replacement for diamonds. This mineral can only form at a high temperature between 2,250°C and 2,700°C.
Another polymorph of ZrO₂ that we observed was a very rare one called ortho-II or OII. It forms at very high pressure – about 130,000 atmospheres, a unit of pressure.
Such pressure and temperature conditions provided us with the proof for the meteorite impact origin of the glass. That’s because such conditions can only be obtained in the Earth’s crust by a meteorite impact or the explosion of an atomic bomb.
More mysteries to solve
If our finding is correct (and we believe it is), the parental crater – where the meteorite hit the Earth’s surface – should be somewhere nearby. The nearest known meteorite craters, named GP and Oasis, are 2km and 18km in diameter respectively, and quite far away from where the glass we tested was found. They are too far and too small to be considered the parental craters for such massive amounts of impact glass, all concentrated in one spot.
The Great Sand Sea desert. Sylvester Adams
So, while we’ve solved part of the mystery, more questions remain. Where is the parental crater? How big is it – and where is it? Could it have been eroded, deformed or covered by sand? More investigations will be required, likely in the form of remote sensing studies coupled with geophysics.",Libyan desert’s yellow glass: how we discovered the origin of these rare and mysterious shards,science + tech
"About half a million babies die each year as a result of pre-eclampsia, an aggressive and potentially life-threatening problem in pregnancy. Approximately 46,000 women also die each year due to the disorder.
The condition – a high blood pressure (hypertension) disorder – can affect multiple organs in the woman’s body, including the liver, kidneys, heart, brain and blood clotting system, as well as the growth and development of the foetus. If severe, and untreated, it can lead to the placenta detaching from the womb (placental abruption), seizures, stroke, maternal death and stillbirth.
Pre-eclampsia can be difficult to predict, and it can progress rapidly. The only treatment is delivery.
In a recent paper we found that planned early birth reduced the risk of stillbirth and improved most outcomes for mothers and babies. We concluded that clinicians can routinely deliver babies for mothers who have pre-eclampsia, from 34 weeks – even in a low resource setting.
We recommend that planned early delivery is implemented to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes in late preterm pre-eclampsia, particularly stillbirth. We argue that the intervention should form part of a concerted global effort to end all maternal and perinatal deaths from preventable causes.
When to deliver
Deciding when to offer birth requires careful balancing of risks and benefits. Early preterm delivery (before 34 weeks’ gestation) is only recommended if severe complications of pre-eclampsia have developed, where the benefit of delivery outweighs the risk of potential complications of early preterm birth for the baby (for example, breathing or feeding difficulties).
For the period between 34 and 37 weeks, there has not been enough research to guide women and clinicians as to whether it is better to routinely offer late preterm birth to all women with pre-eclampsia, or to watch and wait until either 37 weeks’ gestation is reached, or complications develop.
We set out to answer this question in a trial which we carried out in India and Zambia.
The Cradle-4 trial was a randomised controlled trial which compared planned delivery (initiating delivery within 48 hours of trial entry) to usual care (watching and waiting until 37 weeks, or the development of complications needing delivery). Women who agreed to participate were randomly allocated to either planned delivery, or to usual care. A total of 565 women with pre-eclampsia, between 34 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, without an immediate indication for delivery, took part. The trial was conducted across nine sites in India and Zambia.
The study found that planned delivery significantly reduced the risk of stillbirth – by 75%. In addition, planned delivery did not increase the risk of the baby needing to go to the neonatal unit. Neither did it increase the risk of short-term complications after birth, such as breathing or feeding difficulties. This is an especially important finding for clinicians working with limited neonatal resources, who can be reassured that planned early birth is safe.
Encouragingly, planned delivery reduced the risk of severely high blood pressure in the woman, compared to usual care. Rates of other complications such as eclampsia and placental abruption (where the placenta detaches from the womb) were also lower in the planned delivery group. Mothers who delivered early were as likely as those in the usual care group to achieve a vaginal birth, and spent less time in hospital.
Next steps
The current maternal mortality rate in the world is 223 per 100,000. The aim under the Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce that to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.
But this won’t happen unless there is a focus on interventions that address the major causes of maternal death in regions where they are most needed. These include sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, according to the World Health Organization. Our findings show that one such intervention should be to incorporate planned delivery from 34 weeks into routine care.
But this won’t be easy, particularly in low- and lower-middle income settings, due to over-stretched, under-staffed healthcare systems, where access to key resources may be variable.
To progress the idea, a number of steps need to be taken.
Firstly, early delivery should be incorporated into national and international guidelines across the globe. For this to happen there must an increased understanding around pre-eclampsia via community engagement. Women need to be better informed about what to look out for and what action to take, and need to be able to access healthcare facilities.
Community engagement is critical to translating research into impact and creating awareness about ways to alleviate this health issue.
This has already been initiated in some countries. For example, our research group has developed community engagement tools including docu-dramas designed alongside communities in Zimbabwe, Haiti and Sierra Leone.
A recent dynamic awareness campaign about pre-eclampsia was launched in Sierra Leone. It included creating competitions at universities to produce poems and videos about pre-eclampsia, putting stickers on taxis and motorbikes and putting up posters.
In Zambia, a national television broadcast encouraging women to attend antenatal care and recognise the danger signs of pre-eclampsia was shown on World Pre-eclampsia Day.
Secondly, planned delivery needs to be implemented alongside a range of interventions. Medical practitioners need to be enabled to provide early risk stratification, prediction of pre-eclampsia, safe labour and delivery care, and postnatal follow-up.
Thirdly, more research needs to be done in resource-stretched settings. Currently, only 2% of clinical trials take place in sub-Saharan African countries and even fewer address the most important causes of maternal mortality.
The Cradle-4 Trial acts as an important example of how this can be changed, and demonstrates the power of locally-driven evidence.",Early births – between 34 and 37 weeks – for moms with pre-eclampsia can reduce baby and mother deaths,health + medicine
"South Africa’s crime statistics for the third quarter of 2023 show that people continue to face a serious problem of violent crime, especially murder and attempted murder. The country’s per capita murder rate for 2022/23 was the highest in 20 years at 45 per 100,000 (a 50% increase compared to 2012/13).
In response to this crisis, the South African Police Service has reconfigured its policing strategies and plans. Yet, these approaches offer very little innovation. They mostly reaffirm the way the police have typically pursued policing for the past three decades – fighting a “war” on crime and “sweeping away” criminals.
In my view the police have adopted unsuitable crime fighting strategies. This is a “war” the police can’t win on their own, because violent crime is a complex phenomenon. It requires whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. Government departments, civil society groups and the private sector should pool resources and work together in a co-ordinated manner. They must be guided by a common plan. Otherwise crime prevention efforts will be piecemeal, lacking effectiveness.
Determinants and complexity of violent crime
The scholarly literature on violent crime in South Africa, including my research, indicates that interpersonal violence is typically the outcome of a combination of risk factors over time.
One of them is the idea that violence is a legitimate means to resolve conflict between people.
Another is childhood experiences of violence.
Socio-economic elements, such as poverty, unemployment and inadequate living conditions, underpin violence, mainly for younger men. Feelings of stress, frustration and humiliation, combined with substance abuse (chiefly alcohol), inequitable gender norms and the availability of weapons, especially firearms, often results in violent behaviour.
Read more: South Africa won't become less violent until it's more equal
Given what studies say about the determinants of violence, I predicted during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 that South Africa would soon face a crime catastrophe. The pandemic and lockdown regulations had increased poverty, unemployment and food insecurity. This would exacerbate existing risk factors for violence, such as:

diminishing prospects of meaningful jobs, especially for young, marginalised men.
In 2021/22 there was a significant increase in all categories of violent crime.
Since then there’s been no reduction in these risks, especially food insecurity, youth unemployment, child abuse and the school dropout rate. The murder rate per capita has increased from 33.5 per 100,000 during the COVID-19 period (2020/21) to 45 per 100,000 in 2022/23.
Police and the prevention of violent crime
Even though the police are not able to do anything directly about many of the underlying risk factors for violence, studies have shown that specific policing interventions can make a difference in reducing violent crime.
The police can work closely with communities to devise cooperative solutions to crime problems. They can also collect and use relevant intelligence to design and implement evidence-based crime prevention actions. These should focus on the areas where criminal offending is most concentrated, and on the situations that tend to drive that behaviour.
Interventions require a competent, adequately resourced and professional police organisation and a fair and effective criminal justice system.
Since the 1990s the work of the police has included community-oriented approaches. Best practice is for police to treat community safety groups as equal partners. Solutions to crime problems are co-created.
But the police’s approach has been the converse. They have co-opted community safety groups, such as community police forums and neighbourhood watches, to be force multipliers. Studies have shown that such a method is often ineffective.
For the past three decades, South African police have prioritised militarised policing approaches, such as Operation Shanela (“to sweep” in isiZulu). They encourage police to be more forceful in their interactions with alleged criminals.
There is very little evidence to suggest that militarised policing brings down violent crime rates. Instead, it can erode public trust in the police. This is certainly evident in South Africa, where only 27% of the population view the police as trustworthy (from 47% in 1999).
Police effectiveness in combating crime has also been undermined by declining personnel numbers. In 2018, there were 150,639 police personnel, but this is now 140,048. There has also been a substantial decline in the police reserve force.
High levels of crime have placed considerable pressure on the criminal justice system too. Conviction rates for violent crime are very low. For example, between 2019/20 and 2021/22, police recorded 66,486 murder cases. Of these, only 8,103 (12%) resulted in a guilty verdict.
What can be done?
The good news is that the government does not exclusively depend on policing plans to tackle crime. It has also developed multi-departmental and evidence-based strategies and plans to prevent crime. These are derived from Chapter 12 of the National Development Plan. It calls for:
police to be more professional, demilitarised and work in partnership with communities
an improved criminal justice system
an integrated crime prevention strategy.
In 2022 the cabinet approved the Integrated Crime and Violence Prevention Strategy. It seeks to achieve a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach given the multi-dimensional nature of the risk factors that drive violent crime. Furthermore, this strategy encourages government and other elements of society to jointly address common crime problems and collaboratively determine prevention strategies, especially at the community level.

There was also the recognition that various government departments (and not just the police) needed to work closely with civil society and the private sector to drive down crime levels.
The problem is that the implementation of strategy is in limbo. No government agency has been willing to take responsibility for it. That’s because there is no direct budgetary allocation, given the highly constrained government purse.
High levels of crime and low levels of policing have substantial negative effects on economic performance. So investing adequate resources to carry out the Integrated Crime and Violence Prevention Strategy will not only reduce violent crime, but also contribute to economic growth.",South Africa’s police are losing the war on crime – here’s how they need to rethink their approach,politics
"November marks a sombre anniversary in Uganda’s recent political history. In 2020, the east African country’s leading opposition politician, Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, was arrested. He was on the campaign trail ahead of the 2021 presidential elections.
Mass demonstrations demanding the release of the popular musician-turned-presidential-candidate broke out in and around the capital, Kampala. Over two days, security agents of the regime of Yoweri Museveni – in power since 1986 – cracked down on the protests.
They fired live ammunition into crowds of protesters, killing at least 54 people and injuring many more. The regime arrested over a thousand people. Hundreds more have since been reported disappeared.
Three years on, the effects of the massacre loom large over Uganda’s contemporary politics.
The Ugandan Human Rights Commission recently announced it was closing the files of 18 opposition supporters who remain missing. This has renewed demands for justice and government accountability in connection with the 2020 killings.
In my research, I have charted Kyagulanyi’s unlikely political rise from his landslide victory as an independent candidate in a 2017 parliamentary by-election to his 2021 run for the presidency against Museveni.
Kyagulanyi and his supporters have been subject to arrest, abduction and unlawful detention. They have been tortured and some have been killed.
Given this history, it’s not surprising that the Kyagulanyi-led opposition party, the National Unity Platform, has been at the centre of calls for justice.
Over the last month, the party has spearheaded a boycott of parliament in protest of the Museveni regime’s worsening human rights violations. The opposition has demanded that the state take full accountability for the November 2020 killings and inform Ugandans of the whereabouts of those who remain missing.
With just a little over two years to the next presidential election in 2026, I trace the fallout from the November 2020 massacre to highlight its implications for both the Museveni regime and the Kyagulanyi-led opposition.
Calls for accountability
The initial impetus for a parliamentary boycott came on Uganda’s independence day on 9 October 2023. This followed security officers storming the National Unity Platform’s headquarters. They broke up a prayer meeting of party leaders and families whose loved ones have either died or been disappeared. In the raid, 14 people were arrested.
In addition to the boycott, the National Unity Platform has released a list of 20 Ugandans who have been disappeared, 19 of them since the November 2020 protests. The party routinely posts briefs of the missing on its social media platforms in commemoration of what it calls “Black November”.
The Museveni regime hasn’t budged. However, this pressure has led to some action. According to the leader of the opposition in parliament, Mathias Mpuuga, the human rights commission has started to re-contact the families of the missing to get statements.
International repercussions
The 2020 killings and subsequent arrests and disappearances have had recent international repercussions. At the end of October 2023, for example, US president Joe Biden announced his intention to end Uganda’s participation in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) trade programme. Agoa gives exports from qualifying African countries duty-free access to the US market.
In justifying this decision, the White House pointed to the Museveni regime’s “gross violations of internationally recognised human rights”.
This official censure was additionally inspired by Uganda’s recently passed anti-homosexuality law. The White House branded it in May 2023 “a tragic violation of universal human rights”.
There had also been earlier warnings from the US Bureau of African Affairs amid rising levels of state repression during the 2021 election campaign. The bureau said
there will be consequences for those who are continuing to undermine democracy (in Uganda).
Museveni is considered one of the United States’ closest and most reliable military allies in Africa. He has been a “donor darling” of the west for decades. In a New York Times op-ed in 2020, Kyagulanyi labelled Museveni “America’s Favorite African Strongman”.
Indeed, despite the Museveni regime’s worsening human rights record, the US has provided Uganda with hundreds of millions of dollars in development and military aid. This has helped fund the Museveni state’s robust militarisation.
Time will tell if the Biden administration’s Agoa decision is anything more than a slap on the wrist. There are certainly reasons to be sceptical that it is. But given that Uganda currently trades approximately US$200 million in exported goods to the US annually, the decision will have real economic impact.
The Museveni succession
So where does all this leave Kyagulanyi’s party, with just over two years until the country’s next presidential election?
Political rumours about a possible Museveni succession are rife. Some suggest that his son is being groomed to be his political heir.
Despite the Ugandan president “officially” turning 80 next year, opposing him presents the opposition with familiar obstacles.
First, they must contend with unceasing state repression. In September 2023, for instance, Kyagulanyi was received warmly by massive crowds during his tour of Uganda to drum up grassroots support. This campaign, however, was cut short by the government, which accused him of using the rallies to “incite violence (and) promote sectarianism”.
Second, since securing a sixth consecutive victory in elections in 2021, Museveni’s government has co-opted, infiltrated and divided the country’s fragmented opposition.
The country’s second-largest opposition party, the Forum for Democratic Change, for instance, has been mired in a political scandal. It’s been alleged that some of its top leadership accepted campaign funds from Museveni to foil a possible electoral alliance with the National Unity Platform in 2021. Kyagulanyi recently conceded that his party isn’t “really safe from Museveni’s infiltration”.
Finally, Museveni’s grip over Uganda’s military remains strong. This means that any transfer of power through electoral means from Museveni to a Kyagulanyi-led opposition seems unlikely – regardless of how Ugandans actually vote in 2026. Indeed, Kyagulanyi has little connection to Uganda’s powerful military establishment.
All this suggests that as Ugandans memorialise a tragic part of their recent past, their post-Museveni political future remains deeply uncertain.",Black November: remembering Uganda’s massacre of the opposition three years on,politics
"Microbes such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi form part of our everyday lives – they live in us, on us and around us.
We need them for healthy digestion, immune function, and the synthesis of essential nutrients, and we depend on them for farming and industrial processes.
But microbes also cause disease in people, animals and plants. That is why science has developed an arsenal of antimicrobials that kill them or slow their spread.
Over time, microbes develop resistance to antimicrobials, and some eventually evolve into so-called “superbugs” that no longer respond to the drugs. So we see more and more untreatable infections appearing in hospitals and communities.
This phenomenon, known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), means that common illnesses and diseases may become life-threatening again.
Recent figures show that antimicrobial resistance has been linked to close to 5 million deaths annually – more than the total combined death toll of HIV/AIDS and malaria.
It is further estimated that deaths related to drug-resistance could increase to 10 million per year by 2050, overtaking cancer as a leading cause of death worldwide.
World AMR Awareness Week aims to improve awareness and understanding of this silent killer.
Remembering the poor
We need urgent global action to counter antimicrobial resistance. However, current efforts that focus on solutions developed in high-income settings may not be suited to the societal and economic challenges in low- and middle-income countries.
We are members of a multidisciplinary Global Convening Programme set up by The British Academy to look into solutions to this problem that are fair and inclusive. Our collective expertise includes epidemiology, ethics and human rights.
If we want people to become less dependent on antibiotics, we must address the factors that create dependency on antibiotics in the first place.
Antimicrobial resistance is a global issue, but there are some regional differences.
Most human deaths from antimicrobial resistance occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Drug resistance is a growing concern in malaria and tuberculosis in these regions.
Low-income environments often go hand in hand with the use of cheap antimicrobials that may be of poor quality or even falsified. These create the ideal conditions for resistance to emerge.
Many are sold over the counter for self-diagnosed ailments.
Antibiotics, animals and pandemic risk
Antibiotics are among the most widely used antimicrobials. Between 2000 and 2015 the use of antibiotics increased by 65% worldwide.
Globally, however, more antibiotics are used in animals and agriculture than for human health. Of all antimicrobials, 73% are used in animals raised for food.
In September 2016, the United Nations adopted a unanimous resolution recognising the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in animals as a leading cause of rising antimicrobial resistance.
Farmers rely on antibiotics to prevent disease outbreaks and boost production, especially where animals are kept in unhygienic and overcrowded conditions, and where farmers don’t have access to veterinary care. There antibiotics serve as “quick fixes”.
In one study in rural Uganda a woman told researchers she was using left-over antibiotics to treat family members and her chickens. This repurposing of antibiotics is seen as a way to survive and make a living.
Experts warn that antimicrobial resistance in farm animals, if unchecked, could lead to the next pandemic.
Everybody is exposed, everywhere
Environmental pollution in the form of antimicrobial residues spreads to soils, rivers, streams and oceans, as well as food and drinking water, and contributes to resistance. Everyone is exposed to antimicrobials, especially antibiotics, even if they don’t take these medicines themselves.
This kind of pollution is aggravated when antimicrobials are used and disposed of negligently.
The global response needs to be fair to all
We are calling for a new approach to antimicrobial resistance that prioritises equity and sustainability.
Policy options must be carefully considered with all those involved and by embedding public and community voices without having pre-determined solutions in mind.
“Simple” solutions may disadvantage communities that shoulder the heaviest burden of infections and poor healthcare. For example, banning the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics may help to curb excessive use, but it could also deny life-saving treatment for people who have no other options. Similarly, without antibiotics, small-scale pig and poultry farmers may no longer be able to make a living.
The solution we are working towards is fair and inclusive. It respects people and their traditions while also benefiting human health, animal welfare and the natural environment.",Antimicrobial resistance is a silent killer that leads to 5 million deaths a year.

"“On the other bank … that is where Henri Lopes now rests,” wrote novelist and journalist Nicolas Michel in a beautiful tribute to mark the passing of the celebrated Congolese author. It’s a reference, of course, to Lopes’ 1992 novel Sur l'autre Rive (On the Other Bank).
Indeed, how can we not imagine Lopes as the character Andélé from his 1990 novel Le Chercheur d’Afriques (The Researcher of Africa), who describes himself as a man “born between the waters”. Lopes, born to mixed ancestry, was a writer who never wanted to be confined on one “bank”. His novels depicted a broad and inclusive range of characters.
Identity is a key theme in his work, as is colonisation, its after-effects, and the politics of postcolonial Africa. The novels, driven by a quest for social justice, include meditations on women’s rights, dictatorial regimes, racism and a questioning of certain ancestral traditions. It’s not surprising they are political in nature. Lopes was a teacher turned politician who served as prime minister of Congo-Brazzaville.
As a lecturer and scholar of Francophone African literature I focus here on his literary career.
Through his writing Lopes explored the multiple ethnicities that forged his identity. In the process his novels offer insights into how humans from different worlds interact. He dares to show that prejudices and racism are a trait shared by all human beings.
Who was Henri Lopes?
Born Marie-Joseph Henri Lopes in 1937 in Léopoldville (today Kinshasa) in what was then the Belgian Congo, Lopes grew up in Brazzaville across the Congo River. His parents were reportedly both mixed race and abandoned by their European fathers at birth.
The Researcher of Africa is a testimony to the multiple identities of those not considered to be of one pure racial group. Andélé finds himself variously labelled: black, half-black, half-white, Indian, Arab, Jewish, West Indian… Lopes, too, was a cultural kaleidoscope. He never belonged to one river bank but rather embarked on boats which sailed between the two.
Lopes started his career as a teacher but would go on to enter politics, finding an affiliation with President Marien Ngouabi’s left-wing Marxist-Leninist regime. Between 1973 and 1975 Lopes served as prime minister under the fourth president of the Republic of the Congo. A high level position beckoned at Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. In the 1980s and 1990s, Lopes served as deputy director for Africa. In 1998 he was appointed Congo’s ambassador to France. He would serve in the position for 17 years.
But he is best remembered as a writer of fiction.
The literary work
His literary debut Tribaliques (Tribaliks: Contemporary Congolese Stories) was a collection of short stories. Like that of many of his peers, the work focused on themes of tribalism, postcolonial African politics and social injustice. Tribaliques received the Grand Prix Littéraire d'Afrique Noire in 1972.
Readers International
He would go on to publish a dozen works of fiction between 1972 and 2012. The best known of these is the 1982 political satire Le Pleurer-rire (The Laughing Cry). The novel is drenched with witty and barbed insights into the character of postcolonial African politicians. The Researcher of Africa remains one of Lopes’ most studied books.
In 2012 Une Enfant de Poto-Poto (A Child of Poto-Poto) was awarded the Porte Dorée Literary Prize. In 1993 Lopes received the Grand Prix de la Francophonie of the Académie Française for his entire body of work.
The reader of his works will discover honest black men as well as corrupt politicians and dictators. In his analysis of The Laughing Cry, literary scholar Alphonse Dorien Makosso writes that the novel bears “testament to the act of using literature to address socio-historical issues that border on state terrorism, dictatorship and political corruption”. According to Togolese writer Sami Tchak:
The author of The Laughing Cry leaves us, through all his books, a laughter that will always question us.
While Lopes portrays despicable colonisers he also offers white characters who view Africa not as a barbaric place without history, but as a continent endowed with civilisation long before the arrival of westerners.
They will also find many endearing female figures there, whose honour and freedom he defended. Whether they are mothers or sex workers or women who are stigmatised for being sterile, they occupy an important place in the literary production of Henri Lopes.
Legacy
Reading Lopes also means delving into Congolese culture. Fellow countryman and novelist Alain Mabanckou stated that Lopes was admired for “his pen crossed by a caustic irony, his fine humour and his introspection of Congolese morals”.
Congolese customs are revealed in French but interspersed with expressions taken from the languages spoken in Congo. In an interview with Mauritian poet and critic Édouard Maunick Lopes said:
When I write a novel, I am not ideological. I am not looking for my place in African literature. At the start I pause, and I say that I am going to speak Congolese, that I am going to speak Congolese in French, writing in this borrowed language that I love.
Even while affirming his Congolese identity, he refused to be confined to an exclusive “bank”. Lopes wanted to write for everyone, and he succeeded. He found a style that married multiple languages and rhythms to represent the diversity of humanity.
In his own words:
We must not be afraid to describe ourselves, even with our faults.
Lopes has not left; he will live on through his writing. Whatever “other bank” he is resting on, one can be sure that he has joined the beloved spirits of Senegalese author and diplomat Birago Diop’s poem The Dead Are Not Dead. With them, Lopes navigates the planets and galaxies, embracing the multiple races and human identities he had been assigned throughout his life.","Henri Lopes, the prime minister of Congo who became a famous novelist: behind the power of his writing",arts + culture
"When ChatGPT was released in November 2022, it sparked many conversations and moral panics. These centre on the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the information environment. People worry that AI chatbots can negatively affect the integrity of creative and academic work, especially since they can produce human-like texts and images.
ChatGPT is a generative AI model using machine learning. It creates human-like responses, having been trained to recognise patterns in data. While it appears the model is engaging in natural conversation, it references a vast amount of data and extracts features and patterns to generate coherent replies.
Higher education is one sector in which the rise of AI like ChatGPT has sparked concerns. Some of these relate to ethics and integrity in teaching, learning and knowledge production.
We’re a group of academics in the field of media and communication, teaching in South African universities. We wanted to understand how university students were using generative AI and AI-powered tools in their academic practices. We administered an online survey to undergraduate students at five South African universities: the University of Cape Town, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Stellenbosch University, Rhodes University, and the University of the Witwatersrand.
The results suggest that the moral panics around the use of generative AI are unwarranted. Students are not hyper-focused on ChatGPT. We found that students often use generative AI tools for engaged learning and that they have a critical and nuanced understanding of these tools.
What could be of greater concern from a teaching and learning perspective is that, second to using AI-powered tools for clarifying concepts, students are using them to generate ideas for assignments or essays or when they feel stuck on a specific topic.
Unpacking the data
The survey was completed by 1,471 students. Most spoke English as their home language, followed by isiXhosa and isiZulu. The majority were first-year students. Most respondents were registered in Humanities, followed by Science, Education and Commerce. While the survey is thus skewed towards first-year Humanities students, it provides useful indicative findings as educators explore new terrain.
We asked students whether they had used individual AI tools, listing some of the most popular tools across several categories. Our survey did not explore lecturers’ attitudes or policies towards AI tools. This will be probed in the next phase of our study, which will comprise focus groups with students and interviews with lecturers. Our study was not on ChatGPT specifically, though we did ask students about their use of this specific tool. We explored broad uses of AI-powered technologies to get a sense of how students use these tools, which tools they use, and where ChatGPT fits into these practices.
These were the key findings:
41% of respondents indicated that they primarily used a laptop for their academic work, followed by a smartphone (29.8%). Only 10.5% used a desktop computer and 6.6% used a tablet.
Students tended to use a range of other AI-powered tools over ChatGPT, including translation and referencing tools. With reference to the use of online writing assistants such as Quillbot, 46.5% of respondents indicated that they used such tools to improve their writing style for an assignment. 80.5% indicated that they had used Grammarly or similar tools to help them write in appropriate English.
Fewer than half of survey respondents (37.3%) said that they had used ChatGPT to answer an essay question.
Students acknowledged that AI-powered tools could lead to plagiarism or affect their learning. However, they also stated that they did not use these tools in problematic ways.
Read more: ChatGPT is the push higher education needs to rethink assessment
Respondents were overwhelmingly positive about the potential of digital and AI tools to make it easier for them to progress through university. They indicated that these tools could help to: clarify academic concepts; formulate ideas; structure essays; improve academic writing; save time; check spelling and grammar; clarify assignment instructions; find information or academic sources; summarise academic texts; guide students for whom English is not a native language to improve their academic writing; study for a test; paraphrase better; avoid plagiarism; and reference better.
Most students who viewed these tools as beneficial to the learning process used tools such as ChatGPT to clarify concepts related to their studies that they could not fully grasp or that they felt were not properly explained by lecturers.
Engaged learning
We were particularly interested to find that students often used generative AI tools for engaged learning. This is an educational approach in which students are accountable for their own learning. They actively create thinking and learning skills and strategies and formulate new ideas and understanding through conversations and collaborative work.
Read more: 'Please do not assume the worst of us': students know AI is here to stay and want unis to teach them how to use it
Through their use of AI tools, students can tailor content to address their specific strengths and weaknesses, to have a more engaged learning experience. AI tools can also be a sort of personalised online “tutor” with whom they have “conversations” to help them understand difficult concepts.
Concerns about how AI tools potentially undermine academic assessment and integrity are valid. However, those working in higher education must note the importance of factoring in students’ perspectives to work towards new pathways of assessment and learning.

"Kenya’s stock market recently suffered steep losses, making it the worst performing globally. The weak performance has persisted: the Nairobi Securities Exchange 20-share index stood at about 1420 on 10 November 2023, having fallen from 1509 on 29 September 2023, a drop of 6% over the six-week period. In better days, the index has risen above the psychological 5000 mark: for example, it was 5491 on 23 February 2015.
The stock market matters for the Kenyan public for several reasons. First, up to 70% of the retirement savings of Kenyans may be invested in the stock market. So the market’s weakness might inhibit retirement funds from meeting their pension obligations. Second, many Kenyan companies use the stock market to raise capital and weak market performance discourages them from doing so.
Given these benefits, it is important to understand reasons for stock market value fluctuations. Here, I discuss some possible reasons for the market’s dismal performance and suggest possible ways to reverse the trend.
What moves markets
Stock prices move in response to new information that conveys signals about the risks faced by investors. The new information may be something that an investor has uncovered, or that is known by company insiders (although trading on that knowledge is usually illegal), or that is announced publicly by an authority like the central bank.
New information may be about something unique to the company, or something that affects the entire market. New information about a company often affects the company’s price without affecting the market index. However, in small markets such as Kenya’s, where the market index may reflect the presence of a few large companies (such as Safaricom and KCB), changes in the price of one firm’s stock may cause a noticeable change on the index value.
What ails Kenya’s stock market?
An important risk factor that affects the entire market is sovereign (country) risk. Sovereign risk may be responsible for the persistent selling off of shares by international investors at the Nairobi bourse in recent months.
When there are more investors selling shares than those willing to buy, share prices, and the market index, fall. This is because sellers must lower their prices to appeal to the few buyers. In 2022, Kenya’s international investors sold about US$158 million (KES 24 billion) worth of shares, slightly lower than the US$191 million recorded during 2020.
The sell-off may indicate deep-seated political issues affecting Kenya’s economy. These include fears of possible instability post-2022 presidential elections. The country has previously experienced election related violence.
The sell-off may also speak to economic factors. For instance, when US interest rates increase, as they have, international investors tend to pull their money out of developing markets and invest it in US debt markets, a phenomenon called flight to quality.
Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests that emerging stock markets slumped to their lowest between March and September 2023 driven by expectations that US interest rates would remain high.
Third, the stock market jitters may be explained by the weakening Kenyan shilling. For international investors, investing in a Kenyan stock means taking a risk on both the stock and the value of the Kenyan shilling. If the shilling falls in value relative to the investor’s domestic currency (like the US dollar), it may wipe out all the gains on the stock and cause the investor to lose money.
The Kenya shilling lost 21% of its value between 13 September 2022 and 10 November 2023. This has been largely attributed to capital flight and reduced inflow of foreign currency due to the low value of exports.
Then there’s Kenya’s burgeoning public debt. It’s the chicken-and-egg story: a falling shilling increases the burden of debt owed to outside lenders. And the rising cost of servicing debt in a foreign currency increases the supply of the shilling in the currency markets, weakening it further.
In an attempt to stem the slide in the shilling’s value, keep domestic inflation in check, and respond to rising US interest rates, Central Bank of Kenya, like its counterparts globally, has chosen to restrict money supply.
Consequently, the central bank rate, a policy interest rate that guides domestic loan pricing, has increased from 7% in March 2022 to 10.5% in November 2023. When interest rates rise, returns (yields) on debt assets like bonds also rise, making them more attractive than stocks. This induces investors to move their money from stocks to bonds, causing a decline in stock prices.
Expectations
An important recent development is the enactment of Kenya’s Finance Act in June 2023. The Act imposes new taxes and tax increases. The World Bank has warned that higher taxation may discourage investment and increase unemployment.
So there’s an expectation of weaker economic performance and, concomitantly, weaker company performance (due, for example, to lower product demand). The expectation of weaker company performance causes investors to anticipate lower future cash flows (like dividends), which is reflected in lower company valuations today.
Expectations about public debt also matter for companies. Kenya is expected to borrow more, which will increase interest rates on government debt, making it more lucrative for banks to lend to the government than to the private sector. Reduced private sector lending discourages private investments and lowers company valuations.
What should be done?
There is no quick fix to a stock market collapse. Although stock market performance may be driven by sentiment in the short run, it is more beneficial to think long-term.
There’s a close relationship between the broader economy and the stock market. So, as a finance scholar, I offer only one recommendation: diversify and grow the economy.
There is clear evidence of the long-term economic growth benefits of investing in human capital, boosting a country’s entrepreneurial orientation and investing in infrastructure. To grow the economy, therefore, the government’s policymakers should draw from such evidence.
Importantly, the need to strengthen the country’s institutions has never been stronger. This will have the effect of improving governance and accountability as well as investor confidence. With such actions, the stock market needs no intervention.",Kenya’s stock market has suffered steepest losses in the world: an expert view on why and how to reverse it,business + economy
"Imagine you are miles from the nearest restroom, and nature’s call is urgent – a situation that might raise a mild panic during a hike or at a music festival. Now, picture that same scenario, not as a one-off inconvenience, but as a daily reality. This is the case for about half a billion people globally.
In African countries, the issue of open defecation often goes unaddressed by society and policymakers despite its negative impact on health, economic development, dignity and the environment.
Led from Queen’s University Belfast, a team of multidisciplinary researchers aimed to evaluate how prevalent the practice is in African countries and which social factors are driving it. We also aimed to establish which communities were in most urgent need of interventions.
We used demographic and health surveys, alongside World Bank data. In a recent paper we set out our findings.
Our main ones were that in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Niger, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso and Chad, a large number of people engaged in open defecation.
We found that as few as ten countries could account for 247 million Africans defecating in the open by 2030 if critical and emergency actions are not taken.
The biggest driver is lack of access to proper sanitation facilities. The poorest individuals, particularly in rural areas, are more likely to resort to open defecation than people in urban areas. In regions with the most critical need, the poorest are 43 times more likely than the wealthy to resort to open toileting.
We recommend tackling poverty, and intervening in regions and communities that urgently need improved sanitation infrastructure and programmes. West Africa needs special attention since many of its communities are in the critical category.
A systematic approach
Sanitation has far-reaching implications for food safety. Contaminated water sources and unsanitary conditions can spread waterborne diseases, which can contaminate food and put millions at risk. Addressing open defecation is a step in ensuring the safety and hygiene of the food chain.
The link between poor sanitation and health is well documented. But our study casts this relationship in a new, alarming light: the likely role of open defecation in antimicrobial resistance.
Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, to resist the effects of medications that were once used effectively against them. It is a looming crisis, threatening to make antibiotics ineffective. Common infections could once again become deadly.
Our research suggests a probable link between open defecation and antimicrobial resistance. When people defecate outdoors, resistant bacteria from human waste can contaminate water and food. This often leads to faecal-oral diseases and urinary tract infections.
Read more: Gutter to gut: How antimicrobial-resistant microbes journey from environment to humans
However, there is a need for more research to clarify the relationship, its implications and prevention. A clear recommendation from our research is that data about antimicrobial resistance should be integrated into health surveys.
While the full breadth of the study’s findings is huge, its conclusions are clear: open defecation is a challenge in Africa that requires actions. Our research doesn’t just ring the alarm bell; it provides a blueprint for change, identifying specific regions where the practice is most prevalent and where interventions could have the greatest impact.
What needs to be done
Addressing open defecation across a continent as vast and diverse as Africa is no small feat. We made a number of recommendations in the study.
A pragmatic three-tier priority system
This will categorise regions based on the urgency of need for intervention: critical, high, and medium. Regions marked as critical are those with the highest prevalence of open defecation (more than 80% of the population) and the least access to sanitation facilities. These areas need immediate attention with the deployment of resources and sanitation infrastructure. The high priority regions have some access to sanitation. Here, the strategy is a combination of infrastructure development and community education. For medium priority areas (40%-59%), where some sanitation infrastructure may exist, the focus should be on sustainable practices, behavioural change and maintenance of existing facilities.
The system above is just to cut the high rates and inequalities among communities in a country. There is also a lot to do in communities with an open defecation rate of less than 40%. The goal is to reinforce positive behaviour and ensure facilities are maintained and improved.
Policy support, such as incentives for building private toilets or community sanitation blocks, may also help. This tiered strategy hinges on continuous assessment and reallocation of resources. Interventions should respond to the changing landscape as regions improve or decline.
Support sanitation projects and policies
Advocacy is important to increase awareness and donations to organisations that build toilets and provide sanitation programmes in affected areas.
Educate and spread awareness
Learning about the cultural and socio-economic factors that contribute to this practice must be encouraged and the knowledge shared with others. Campaigns that focus on the importance of sanitation for health and the environment are key.
Encourage sustainable sanitation practices
This includes using toilets properly, not littering, and understanding local challenges. The use of compostable toilets and other sustainable waste management practices where traditional toilets are not feasible must be encouraged.
Foster global partnerships for sanitation
Global partnerships can amplify efforts to end open defecation. Collaborations between governments, NGOs, private sector stakeholders and international organisations must be encouraged. Pooling resources and sharing knowledge can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions.",There are too few toilets in Africa and it’s a public health hazard – how to fix the problem,environment + energy
"Sub-Saharan African countries strongly rely on the agricultural and forestry sectors. Agriculture contributes up to 60% of some countries’ gross domestic product. But the sector is highly vulnerable to climate change because it relies heavily on climatic factors. This vulnerability is particularly marked in the region because of its slow rate of technological advancement.
As agricultural economists we carried out a review of the literature on the climate change challenge for agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. We explored the distribution of various climatic factors (like rainfall, temperature and extreme weather events) across the region, and their impact on agriculture. We also investigated what rural farmers were doing to respond to climate change.
We found that the implications of climate change for agricultural and economic development are diverse across the region. It is difficult to predict exactly how climate change will affect agriculture and economic development.
But is is clear that sub-Saharan African countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Botswana, and Kenya are extremely vulnerable to climate change.
Farmers are not using effective adaptation strategies. These include planting drought tolerant crop varieties, and conserving water and soil. Limited resources and infrastructure have held them back. Mitigation programmes such as carbon pricing, water management, recycling, afforestation and reforestation have had limited impact. Poor climate change awareness, unstable government policies and political instability have hindered the programmes.
The impact of climate change on vulnerable households will be extreme if adequate measures are not taken in time. Research suggests that countries such as Togo, Nigeria, Congo and Mali will record more agricultural losses without adaptation. Governments, international organisations, local communities and other stakeholders need to develop strategies to address the diverse needs of rural farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.
What our review found
The studies we reviewed indicated that patterns of rainfall, temperature and extreme weather events have changed significantly in the region. This trend is not expected to change in future decades.
Sub-Saharan Africa experiences diverse rainfall patterns. Annual rainfall can be as low as 100 millimetres in arid areas in the Sahel and parts of east Africa and over 500 millimetres in tropical areas in central and western Africa.
Temperatures can often exceed 40°C (104°F) during the hottest months. Over the last century, the mean temperature has increased by about 0.74°C.
The region experiences various extreme weather events, including droughts, floods and heatwaves. Coastal areas, especially in the eastern and southern regions, experience cyclones or tropical storms.
Many studies show that these conditions affect agricultural production and society in a number of ways:
Yield reduction: Climate change reduces crop yield. Higher temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, droughts and floods affect harvests. For instance, farmers in Nigeria have seen lower yields caused by new pests, disease outbreaks and the drying up of rivers.
Food insecurity: Poor agricultural productivity often leads to food insecurity, which affects both rural and urban populations. Lower crop yields can cause prices to rise. Reduced access to food can worsen malnutrition and hunger.
Income loss and poverty: Lower agricultural output affects the income of smallholder farmers. This can increase poverty levels and economic vulnerability. We found a decline in cereal production over the last decade in Ghana, Congo and South Africa.
Decreased livestock productivity: Higher temperatures, changes in forage availability, and water scarcity are a challenge for livestock farmers. These make livestock prone to diseases and death. Farmers incur high costs to immunise and treat animals.
Vulnerability of smallholder farmers: These farmers don’t always have the resources and capacity to adapt to the impact of climate change.
Recommendation and policy implications
The review of studies showed that sub-Saharan Africa could develop economically if rural farmers took more effective measures against climate change.
We made the following recommendations to protect farmers from the impact of climate change:
Strengthen institutions for policy development and implementation. Coordinating climate change adaptation efforts and sustainable agricultural practices improves farm productivity.
Improve rural infrastructure. This would promote economic growth, reduce poverty and make rural communities more resilient.
Initiate public welfare programmes. Improved access to finance, markets, education and climate information would enhance social protection.
Establish more forest plantations and maintain existing ones. They would help absorb the impact of climate change on agriculture and promote economic development.
Afforestation and reforestation can also help absorb carbon and conserve biodiversity.",Climate change and farming: economists warn more needs to be done to adapt in sub-Saharan Africa,environment + energy
"Fragile and least developed countries have had their development assistance cut drastically, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. For instance, net official development assistance to sub-Saharan African countries has shrunk by 7.8% compared to 2021. And development aid for peace and conflict prevention has declined to its lowest in 15 years.
These cuts will hit fragile countries hard. Fragile countries make up 24% of the world’s population and account for 73% of the world’s extreme poor. The list includes Mali, Lebanon, Somalia, Syria and Iraq.
Budget cuts are already having far-reaching effects and fuelling humanitarian crises. The World Food Programme estimates that “every one percent cut in food assistance risks pushing more than 400,000 people towards the brink of starvation”.
UN secretary-general António Guterres has warned that aid cuts threaten to undo gains in development. Keeping in mind that poverty has increased in conflict-affected countries despite a global downward trend, we anticipate that such a reversal could contribute to global instability.
Violent conflict has already been on the rise among countries that rely heavily on foreign financial assistance. Decades of research (including ours) show that marginalised populations are most vulnerable to be (re-)mobilised into fighting and are typically also most affected by armed conflict (even after violence ends).
It is true that political and societal context matters and needs to be taken into account. But the reduction in aid allocation to least developed countries and especially those recovering from violent conflict could put fragile countries on a trajectory of (renewed) political instability and underdevelopment. Already vulnerable populations will have to yet again carry the brunt of new cycles of violence and impoverishment.
We have been researching links between development and violent conflict for decades and close to a decade, respectively. Our latest research project is on the institutional legacies of violent conflict. It shows how and why violent conflicts persist, how and why their legacies endure, and what can be done to reduce the risk and impact of violence. We recommend that development aid needs to correspond more closely with mounting peacebuilding and humanitarian needs in fragile settings.
The impact
Not all development aid is effective in bringing stability or building peace. Nevertheless, based on our analysis, development aid plays a crucial role in six key areas.
Firstly, development aid is effective when linked to the delivery of public services. These in turn strengthen the social contract and mitigate the risk of violence.
Secondly, financial assistance can help governments absorb the effects of economic shocks. Economies across the global south are already stifled by the aftermath of the COVID pandemic, climate risks and the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine. Fragile countries often rely on assistance to meet some of their population’s most basic needs such as food or water.
Without additional financial assistance many governments will not be able to manage their way through these shocks. That may embolden violent non-state actors to gain power.
Two examples stand out. In west Africa violent non-state actors operating in the Sahel region are set to expand their influence into new areas considered stable thus far, such as the north of Côte d’Ivoire.
Similarly, the current Israel-Palestine conflict risks spreading instability into neighbouring countries amid longstanding tensions and economic fragility.
Thirdly, cuts in development aid may reduce the limited leverage western countries still have to prevent the rise of opportunistic armed groups such as the Wagner Group, the spread of extremism and the risk of civil conflicts.
The Sahel region is also emblematic for this dynamic. Mali and Burkina Faso have seen the deadliest year on record as their military transitional governments struggle to contain jihadist insurgencies. Since the recent military coup in Niger, which prompted withdrawal of both aid and international troops, the country has also experienced a surge in militant violence.
Fourth, worsening economic and security conditions in fragile and least developed countries are already reverberating into Europe. There have been spikes in irregular border crossings into European Union countries in 2023.
Fifth, rising discrepancy in development aid allocation could amplify mistrust in international institutions and western actors. That could contribute to worsening security situations. Some governments in fragile countries are already reluctant to continue to engage with the UN and especially western actors to combat violent non-state actors.
An example of this is the Democratic Republic of Congo’s recent request to the UN for an “accelerated” withdrawal of troops. It comes 24 years after the start of Monusco, the UN’s peacekeeping mission in DRC, one of the largest in the world. Violence may increase in the absence of such international intervention, as has happened since the withdrawal of Minusma, the UN mission that was in Mali for ten years.
Sixth, the reduction in aid allocation to least developed countries and especially those recovering from violent conflict could result in continued political instability and underdevelopment.
Next steps
Development funding should be allocated in a way that corresponds more closely with peacebuilding and humanitarian needs. This is also made clear in the UN’s New Agenda for Peace. It calls for action now to
reinforce the cooperative frameworks that are necessary to move us from the path to destruction to the path to prosperity … based on a reforged commitment to multilateral solutions, grounded on trust, solidarity and universality.
Correcting course in aid allocation could address some of the growing mistrust among developing countries and support prospects for peace.","Development aid cuts will hit fragile countries hard, could fuel violent conflict",business + economy
"The history of South Africa’s struggle against apartheid (separatist white minority rule) is taught only through the broadest of brushstrokes in the country’s schools. So might music be a way to bring the story of one anti-apartheid activist alive for a new generation? And when that activist is a Black gay man, Simon Nkoli (1957-1998), how do you reclaim his story from the stereotypes all of those labels potentially carry?
Those were the challenges facing South African composer Philip Miller when he began work on what became Nkoli: The Vogue Opera, on at The Market Theatre in Johannesburg. As part of my ongoing research into South African music, I interviewed Miller and members of the company about how Nkoli came to the stage.
Why the musical matters
The story was personally and politically important to Miller, who knew Nkoli:
We’d be at the Skyline; Simon would have a dance, have fun – and also be an Aids activist, talking to people about condoms.
(Skyline was a gay bar in downtown Johannesburg that drew a racially mixed clientele during apartheid.) Miller was horrified that someone who had played a vital role in gay rights being enshrined in the South African constitution – the first African nation to do so – was, today, so little known.
Nkoli also co-founded Johannesburg Pride, the first pride march in Africa. “That knowledge,” says Miller, “can be revolutionary and inspirational for today’s collective struggles too.” It prompts a re-think of the individualism sometimes attached to identity issues.
Dancer Lwanele Masiza. Mark Lewis/Nkoli: The Vogue Opera
Miller’s first thought was an opera – “but most young people wouldn’t dream of going to the opera!” He considered a score incorporating disco and the South African pop of the era, which Nkoli loved (as his letters from prison revealed). Nkoli had been imprisoned alongside 11 other activists after the Delmas Treason Trial and came out as gay in prison, forcing the liberation movement to acknowledge queers and influencing the freedoms later enshrined in the constitution. Miller also considered rap – “which in some ways serves the same function as operatic recitative, but more interestingly”.
Choral protest songs – a key sonic component of Nkoli’s time in the leadership of Cosas, the anti-apartheid Congress of South African Students – also had to be heard.
Vogueing meets opera
Then Miller looked at the African-American queer tradition of vogueing (a stylised queer dance display adopting and subverting catwalk model poses) with a soundtrack rooted in disco but more electronic, with beats kicking harder. South Africa’s LGBTIQ+ community had a similar tradition in beauty pageants such as Miss Glow Vaal, which Nkoli had helped organise. TV shows like RuPaul’s Drag Race, plus the use of vogueing by artists such as US pop star Beyoncé in her Renaissance tour, mean the format’s appeal now extends to young South Africans of all identities. But the score Miller created from those diverse inspirations had to be synthesis, not pastiche.
Composer Philip Miller. Mark Lewis/Nkoli: The Vogue Opera
A team came together, including many longtime Miller collaborators and, eventually, a full 26-member theatre ensemble, many youthful and drawn from the LGBTQI+ community. They include South African rap lyricist Gyre and UK guest Rikki Beadle-Blair as director and dramaturge. Beadle-Blair is a performer, director and award-winning playwright, as well as a queer rights and health activist and the host of UK vogueing balls.
But even more mature cast members, such as Bongani Kubheka (playing Delmas trialist Gcina Malindi, who defended Nkoli from gender-based harassment in jail) came to the script knowing very little of Nkoli’s story. He says:
I didn’t even know there was a queer activist in the struggle! It’s certainly broadened my perspectives on our history.
Long walk to stage
The project began as a 2020 workshopped production first titled GLOW (after the Gay and Lesbian Organisation of the Witwatersrand), shaped by a collective process and careful listening to many who had known and worked with Nkoli. These included Beverly Ditsie, former Constitutional Court judge Edwin Cameron, Nkoli’s defence lawyer Caroline Heaton-Nicholls and Nkoli’s mother, Elizabeth Nkoli.
Singer Ann Masina. Mark Lewis/Nkoli: The Vogue Opera
Consultation reinforced an acute awareness of the responsibility the production carried. “Even the protest songs were very carefully chosen,” says Miller. “We use Yindlela (Inde Yendlela), which had been appropriated by (former president) Jacob Zuma. We re-appropriate it back. The lyrics allude to the long walk to freedom, and underline that a) we haven’t got there yet; b) nobody told us it’d take so long, and c) LGBTIQ+ people have the right to ‘sissy that walk’!”
Miller recalls “massive debates” in the team about every aspect of the show. He’s not, he says, creating hagiography, and from the conversations with Ditsie came an honest representation of the blind spots that even men like Nkoli had about women’s struggles. The conversations with Elizabeth also created what cast members experience as one of the most moving arias, when singer Ann Masina, playing Elizabeth, recalls her hopes and fears for her son, and reflects that despite his role, she still lives in Sebokeng, dependent on a government grant.
Masina says the song sometimes makes her sob. She deals with those emotions during rehearsals “so I can bring the power but not the breaking-down to the stage”.
The importance of joy
There’s joy in the music, too: music director Tshegofatso Moeng confesses to “some moments when I just want to stop conducting and dance!”
Read more: Simon Nkoli's fight for queer rights in South Africa is finally being celebrated – 24 years after he died
And for Miller, that joy is vital. Vogueing’s assertions of joy and excellence, he says, defy repressive straight sensibilities and are part of its revolutionary potential. “Vogueing’s display categories declare: 'I can be anybody I want to be’. But I’ve created some music that deliberately crashes against that ‘walking the runway’, to create a subversive tension.” One song declares: “Coming out is not a Diana Ross song.”

"To what extent does private investment help developing countries to reduce conflict and violence and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals?
This is a hotly debated issue. Most international institutions such as the World Bank Group take the stance that the problem is not enough private investment. So they mobilise public resources to subsidise and protect private sector actors with the goal of greatly increasing foreign direct investment.
Meanwhile, community, labour and human rights advocates – particularly in fragile and conflict-affected countries – tend instead to see the dominant patterns of foreign direct investment as part of a continuing history of exploitation of the developing world.
To help shed light on this debate, we undertook a comprehensive study of thousands of projects of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group. We focused on the period between 1994 and 2022.
We chose the IFC because it claims to invest with developmental purpose. It also purports to apply the highest standards of social and environmental performance. Additionally, many other private and public actors follow its lead in setting standards. If the IFC is getting it wrong it would be a good indicator of how things stand in the broader global system. We focused our study on the relationship between IFC projects and armed conflict, as violence has a clear and detrimental effect on human development.
The results establish that IFC projects cause significant increases in armed conflict around the world. A single project, on average, causes 7.6 additional armed conflict events in the year after it is introduced. These findings are consistent with other large quantitative studies that question the relationship between foreign direct investment and development. Foreign direct investment that increases violent conflict and makes development nearly impossible appears the rule, not the exception.
We conclude that current approaches to foreign investment need urgent reconsideration, with particular focus on the risk of violent conflict.
Our methodology
Many factors influence violent conflict, including the history of intergroup and state-society relations. So the study used sophisticated econometric analyses to isolate the IFC’s impact.
We first geolocated IFC projects and noted the years in which they were approved. Then we tested whether armed conflict rose in the area proximate to the IFC project in the following year. We controlled for other factors – such as the presence of politically excluded groups, GDP, the regime type, or the population size – that affect conflict.
In the analysis, we were careful to match and compare an IFC project area with those areas without IFC projects to which it is most similar. Finally, we considered and controlled for the possibility that conflict was already rising before the IFC project arrived. By excluding these other explanations for conflict events, we were able to make reasonable causal attributions.
Read more: Three priorities Africa's newbie on the World Bank board should focus on
Disturbingly, the study found that increases in armed conflict were concentrated in projects that the IFC told local and international stakeholders had potential limited adverse environmental or social risks. It claimed that these could be readily addressed through mitigation measures. These mitigation measures appear to be either ineffective or under-employed. Alternatively, the IFC is mis-classifying projects that carry more substantial conflict risk than it recognises or cares to make public.
One particularly disturbing example is the Ugandan government’s campaign of terror against local citizens to turn land over to an IFC client. The IFC also has yet to resolve activists’ complaints from 2019 of gender-based violence and threats of reprisals and intimidation against one of its project partners, Salala Rubber Corporation in Liberia.
The study also demonstrated that capital-intensive projects (that is, agribusiness, oil, gas, mining and infrastructure) have a larger propensity for socio-political and socio-economic disruption. Areas that receive capital-intensive projects experience, on average, an additional death from armed conflict in the following year.
Not above the rule of law
These results should perhaps not be surprising. Civil society groups have long concluded that the IFC prioritises its own profits and business interests over the “suffering of others” in ways that contribute to “multiple paths of extraction, dispossession, and conflict”. In 2020 Human Rights Watch characterised the IFC as “failing at remedies for project abuses”. This was based on the World Bank Group’s own commissioned review.
Read more: Cautious welcome: World Bank and IMF return to Africa, but questions remain
Yet, the IFC’s strategy has been to position itself above the rule of law. It continues to assert sovereign immunity. It claims that, as an international organisation, it should not be liable in national courts – even to parties it admittedly harms.
It maintains this stance despite recent reports of IFC complicity in covering up the sexual abuse of children to further its investment projects.
It appears beyond time for the 186 member governments that own the IFC to demand transparency, accountability and redress for harms done from the corporation and the private sector actors it funds. Others can also play a role. Governments that have perhaps naively relied on the World Bank halo should question the benefits they are told they can expect from IFC investments. The ratings agencies that classify IFC bonds as positive from an environmental, social, and governance perspective may want to question the bases on which such determinations are made.
At the same time, perhaps more credence can be given to recent calls by the UN secretary general to reform the global financial system to better support human security and human development.
This could include specialised intermediaries between the IFC and sensitive projects in difficult places. Independent and empowered local oversight appears necessary to ensure more inclusive and accountable forms of contextual analysis and risk mitigation planning, monitoring and evaluation of development impact, proactive conflict management, and accessible redress for harms done. This could reduce violent conflict and open more developmental potential for private investment in the developing world.",Projects funded by the World Bank Group’s private sector arm fuel violent conflict – it’s time to reform the system,business + economy
"The Democratic Republic of Congo is expected to hold elections on 20 December 2023. The country’s electoral commission has announced President Felix Tshisekedi will be seeking reelection alongside 23 other candidates. They include Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege and the runner-up in the 2018 presidential election, Martin Fayulu. The courts will confirm the final list of candidates. One key political figure has yet to make his intentions known: Joseph Kabila. He was president for 18 years until Tshisekedi took over in 2019. The DRC’s constitution allows two five-year terms, but he remained in power by delaying elections. He holds substantial political, military and business sway. Jonathan R. Beloff is a political scholar who researches the politics and security of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. We asked him some questions.
What is the Kabila family’s place in the DRC’s politics?
Joseph Kabila was the country’s fourth president. He took office after the assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who was killed by his bodyguard in 2001. Joseph later won presidential elections in 2006 and 2011.
The surprise 2018 election of Felix Tshisekedi, who took power in January 2019, as president interrupted more than two decades of the Kabila family’s rule. At the time, Joseph was constitutionally barred from running for president – and he had already overshot his second term by more than three years.
The Kabila family became a political powerhouse after gaining control in 1996. With the assistance of other countries – such as neighbours Uganda, Angola and Rwanda – the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, under the leadership of Laurent Kabila, overthrew the long-standing Zairian dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. This was during the First Congo War (1996-1997).
Laurent’s tenure was riddled with ineffectiveness and corruption. In less than two years, he had dismissed his minister of defence, the Rwandan James Kabarebe, and begun arming anti-Rwandan forces. These forces contained actors who participated in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.
Laurent claimed his government only backed these forces after Rwanda attempted to overthrow his regime.
The bloody Second Congo War (1998-2003) led to at least two million deaths, many of them from disease and extreme poverty rather than warfare itself. While Kabarebe’s invasion attempt on the capital Kinshasa in 1998 failed, the vast DRC was divided into spheres of influence for different nations and their aligned rebel groups. This status quo only began to break after Laurent’s assassination, which led to the rise of his son Joseph.
Joseph learned military strategy, tactics and politics under Kabarebe. The two worked together after the Second Congo War to flush out many anti-Rwandan forces. This included the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. They also campaigned together during the 2011 presidential elections, which Joseph won.
Joseph initially cast himself as a reformer who would end the Second Congo War and pursue policies to spur political and economic development. However, instability in eastern Congo persisted under his rule, with accusations of massive corruption that undermined the nation’s development.
How much sway does Joseph Kabila hold today?
Joseph Kabila remains a strong presence within Congo’s political, economic and military institutions. He has strong networks developed over 18 years in power. He could use this influence to sway the vote towards any of the candidates.
His influence stems from favourable business and political alliances he created when he was president. Like Mobutu, Kabila used his vast financial resources to secure favourable relationships with Congolese and foreign business leaders. A document leak in 2021 revealed that Kabila received over US$138 million from corruption and bribes.
There were claims that the former president originally convinced Tshisekedi to accept a power-sharing agreement. Under it, Tshisekedi would be president, while Kabila would control political decisions behind the scenes. The near appointment of Ronsard Malonda as the president of the electoral body illustrated Kabila’s political influence. Malonda held senior positions during the country’s 2006, 2011 and 2018 elections. He has been accused of rigging results in favour of Kabila.
Such accusations have benefited Tshisekedi’s election campaign. He is depicting himself as a candidate not tied to the corruption within DRC.
If Kabila does decide to campaign, political dynamics within much of Congo’s civil society, military and economy will be divided. Government ministers and officials will be forced to choose to support either the incumbent or Kabila’s preferred candidate.
What was Tshisekedi expected to change after he routed Joseph Kabila?
There was initial hope that Tshisekedi’s government would foster peace in eastern Congo, establish greater national unity and help solve the nation’s economic woes after decades of corruption and conflict. However, these problems have persisted.
Initially, Amnesty International praised Tshisekedi for pardoning political prisoners and allowing greater public space for criticisms of the Congolese government. He also began investigations on past mineral deals during the Kabila governments. As the African Union chair from 2021 to 2022, he pushed for greater attention to the COVID-19 pandemic and promoted the African Continental Free Trade Area.
Despite initial attempts to foster more significant relations with Rwanda, relations soured in 2022. This was after the Congolese government accused Rwanda of supporting the resurrected M23 rebels.
Rwanda denied the allegations. It has also accused Tshisekedi’s government of being hostile to the Congolese Tutsi population – the Banyamulenge – who are historically related to Rwandans.
The US Department of State has expressed concern about Tshisekedi’s anti-Banyamulenge rhetoric, as well as democratic transparency in the upcoming election.
Tshisekedi’s campaign strategy seems to focus on promoting security in eastern DRC by not only defeating the M23, but also attacking Rwanda for interfering in Congolese affairs. The securitisation of the Banyamulenge and Rwanda – the political manipulation to stir public fear – has helped deflect internal criticisms of the Tshisekedi regime.
Whether the elections take place is another area of concern. There are concerns that Tshisekedi will delay or cancel the election by citing security concerns. If this happens, it might be perceived by domestic and international partners as political interference by the ruling regime.",DRC elections: the Kabila family legacy looms large over the country’s polls,politics
"Housing is a critical social determinant of health. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines healthy housing as a shelter that supports physical, mental and social wellbeing.
The WHO has developed guidelines outlining the attributes of healthy housing. These include structural soundness, as well as access to a local community that enables social interactions. Healthy housing protects inhabitants from the effects of disasters, pollution, waste and extreme heat or cold. It provides a feeling of home, including a sense of belonging, security and privacy.
Health risks in the home environment are important to think about because of the amount of time people spend there. In countries where unemployment levels are high or where most work is home based, people spend more than 70% of their time indoors. Children especially spend a large amount of time at home, which exposes them to any health risks in the home environment.
We are researchers from the African Population and Health Research Center with an interest in urbanisation and population dynamics. We recently set out to study the link between housing and children’s health. We found that healthy housing generally lowered the chances of children falling ill with three diseases that we tracked: diarrhoea, acute respiratory illnesses and fever.
The impacts of housing quality extend beyond health and can have significant implications for education and subsequent economic outcomes, particularly for children.
The research
Rapid urbanisation and population growth in Africa have pushed many people into informal settlements. Sub-Saharan Africa has 65% of the world’s slum dwellers. This population generally lives in poor housing that lacks access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene services. The structures are overcrowded. They tend to have leaking roofs and damp walls, floors and foundations. They may also have indoor pollution, compromising the health of millions of people.
We set out to evaluate the relationship between healthy housing and the likelihood of children falling sick across six African countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.
We studied the incidence of diarrhoea, acute respiratory illness and fever among children under the age of five. These three conditions can have severe consequences for child health and wellbeing.
Diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections are leading causes of disease and deaths in children aged below five worldwide. Diarrhoea accounted for 9% of all deaths among children under five in 2019. Acute respiratory illnesses caused about 20% of deaths among children in this age group. The burden of under-five deaths linked to diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses like pneumonia is higher for children in developing countries than those in developed regions.
We selected the six countries in our study because they provided data on the three diseases we tracked. They also allow for a comparative analysis across African countries. Our study used the latest available demographic and health survey data at the time of our research: Burkina Faso (2010), Cameroon (2011), Ghana (2014), Kenya (2014), Nigeria (2018) and South Africa (2016). We sampled data on 91,096 children aged under five.
The findings
Our study found that healthy housing was generally associated with reduced odds of contracting the three illnesses we considered: diarrhoea, acute respiratory illness and fever. Our definition of healthy housing considered several attributes, including sanitation, drinking water sources and housing characteristics.
Homes that protect occupants from the elements, ensure access to adequate space and reduce overcrowding help keep children healthy. Homes that use cleaner cooking and lighting fuels reduce household air pollution, which leads to lower chances of respiratory infections.
Children living in healthy housing had fewer incidences of fever in all countries apart from South Africa. Here, children living in the healthiest homes are twice as likely to have fever than those living in unhealthy homes.
Fever is an indication of an underlying infection that could be viral or bacterial. Such infections are common in South Africa. In addition, the main causes of fevers among children under five are diarrhoea and acute respiratory illnesses. Among the countries included in the analysis, South Africa had the highest proportion of young mothers (aged below 25) and never-married mothers. This increases the chances that these mothers are engaged in work outside the home, leading to the early introduction of complementary feeding. This has been shown to increase the incidence of diarrhoea. These results call for addressing the causes of diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses by, for instance, ensuring South African homes have access to clean drinking water, adequate sanitation and clean energy for cooking.
While healthy housing is crucial, it’s not the sole determinant of a child’s health. Other factors, such as a sense of community, environmental exposure, parental education, income levels, healthcare access, and maternal and child-level factors also contribute to the overall health status of children. For instance, we found that children in Burkina Faso who were not breastfed had higher chances of getting diarrhoea than those who were breastfed despite the condition of their housing. This tracks with studies that have documented that breastfeeding has a protective role over gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections among children.
What next
From our findings, parents can improve the wellbeing of their children by implementing simple strategies. This includes ensuring they use clean energy for cooking to reduce indoor air pollution and consequently reduce the incidence of acute respiratory illnesses. Similarly, using clean drinking water, hand washing and improving sanitation can help reduce cases of diarrhoea.
Bold but nuanced policy and programme government-level interventions can also help address the incidence of diseases affecting children under five in Africa. This requires efforts that go beyond just addressing the issue of housing to working with complementary sectors, like health, urban planning, environment and education.",Health risks at home: a study in six African countries shows how healthy housing saves children’s lives,health + medicine
"Plastic pollution is an urgent environmental issue, globally. Every year, about eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans.
Most of the 17 west African countries have a problem managing plastic waste. Eight of them are among the top 20 with the least effective plastic waste management practices – up from five in 2015. This has worsened marine pollution and adversely affected activities in the region.
Coastal provinces account for about 56% of west Africa’s GDP and one-third of the population lives there.
In 2018, west African nations launched the West Africa Coastal Area Management Programme to protect and restore the ecological, social and economic assets of coastal areas. It’s supposed to do this by addressing coastal erosion, flooding and pollution. Last year it received an additional US$246 million in funding from the World Bank. This has brought the World Bank’s total financing of the project to US$492 million.
For many years, we have researched development economics, particularly the interface between the use of natural resources and the development of countries. We’ve also been involved in research on plastic pollution through the interdisciplinary “Revolution Plastics” initiative of the University of Portsmouth’s Centre for Blue Governance.
Our findings on plastic pollution could help west African countries to spend World Bank funds effectively.
We recommend that nations first quantify the volume, type and origin of plastics discarded in coastal zones. Then they must focus on reducing plastics from source, as well as promoting reuse and recycling. They can draw on successful case studies globally, which can be adapted to local contexts.

Healthy oceans and a circular economy
The West Africa Coastal Area Management Programme has initiated studies to assess the environmental and economic impact of plastic pollution in the region. These studies also aim to explore the benefits of moving to a circular economy: an economic system that reuses or regenerates materials or products in a sustainable way.
The programme expects that a circular economy will create new economic opportunities through markets for reusing products and materials. Rather than discarding products, they can be put back into the economy. This can create demand for services and technologies related to collecting and processing them.
The programme can benefit from research on sustainable plastic management from other regions to achieve its objectives.
Research partnership
The Centre for Blue Governance has expertise in blue economy, marine ecosystem management, climate change and circular economy. It has extensively researched plastic pollution in Portsmouth, a port city in the United Kingdom, and beyond. We have found that sustainable plastic management can be achieved in various ways. These strategies could be relevant for initiatives in west Africa. They include:
Inclusive partnerships: Collaborating with businesses, campaigners and citizens on the Revolution Plastics initiative, we apply research to develop eco-friendly fabrics and combat microplastic pollution.
Awareness campaigns through art: Community awareness of the harmful effects of plastic pollution is necessary. Through the Masibambisane project in South Africa, we explored street art, theatre and song to create awareness about plastic pollution.
The project achieved significant results in KwaMhlanga, in South Africa’s Mpumalanga province. It demonstrated that raising awareness through art could inspire people to change their behaviour. These communities now have a deeper understanding of the urgent need to act against plastic pollution.
In addition, the introduction of sorting facilities close to homes increased recycling rates and encouraged sustainable habits. The west African programme can incorporate these lessons into the e-book it is planning. This is a way to share information about best practices and encourage action in communities.
Reuse and recycling projects: Through our inDIGO-EU and Microseap projects we reduced plastic waste by promoting recycling and reuse. For example, the INdIGO project has developed biodegradable fishing gear that reduces the environmental impact of ocean fishing in the UK and France. Based on this project, the West Africa Coastal Area Management Programme can develop a sustainable alternative to the gear used for small-scale fishing in the region.
From diagnosis to action
Our research findings suggest that for optimal use of the World Bank fund, the West Africa Coastal Area Management Programme could consider the following action plans:
Collect data on plastic pollution: Start with a regional study to quantify the volume, typology and origin of plastics discarded in coastal zones. This could involve the use of technologies such as drones, sensors and remote sensing to map pollution hotpots. Perception surveys could also help to understand behaviours and attitudes related to plastic pollution. The aim is to establish precise indicators and predictive models that can measure how well future interventions work.
Plan for a switch to a circular economy: The plan should focus on source reduction, reuse, recycling and material recovery. A committee made up of government actors, private enterprises and local communities could oversee implementation.
Design community awareness and education programmes: These campaigns should instil a sense of environmental responsibility and give people tools to actively participate in reducing plastic pollution. Involving opinion leaders could increase their impact.
Develop ways to use plastic waste: Value chains for sorting, recycling and valorising require infrastructure, like modern sorting centres. Advanced recycling technologies and market mechanisms for recycled materials are also necessary. Partnerships could be established with local businesses to create products from recycled plastics, such as construction materials or textiles.
By investing in these targeted areas, it is possible to create a sustainable system that offers economic and social opportunities to local communities.",West Africa’s plastic waste could be fuelling the economy instead of polluting the ocean: experts,environment + energy
"The UK supreme court has unanimously ruled that the government’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful.
Upholding an earlier decision by the court of appeal, the supreme court found that asylum seekers sent to Rwanda may be at risk of refoulement – being sent back to a country where they may be persecuted, tortured or killed.
The courts cited extensive evidence from the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) that Rwanda does not respect the principle of non-refoulement – a legal obligation. The UNHCR’s evidence questioned the ability of Rwandan authorities to fairly assess asylum claims. It also raised concerns about human rights violations by Rwandan authorities, including not respecting non-refoulement with other asylum seekers.
It is important to note that the supreme court’s decision is not a comment on the political viability of the Rwanda plan, or on the concept of offshoring asylum processes generally. The ruling focused only on the legal principle of non-refoulement, and determined that in this respect, Rwanda is not a “safe third country” to send asylum seekers.
The ruling is another blow to the government’s promise to “stop the boats”. And since the Rwanda plan is at the heart of its new Illegal Migration Act, the government will need to reconsider its asylum policies. This is further complicated by Conservative party infighting and the firing of home secretary Suella Braverman, just two days before the ruling.
How did we get here?
For years, the UK government has been seeking to reduce small boat arrivals to the UK. In April 2022, the UK and Rwanda signed an agreement making it possible for the UK to deport some people seeking asylum in Britain to Rwanda, without their cases being heard in the UK. Instead, they would have their cases decided by Rwandan authorities, to be granted (or rejected) asylum in Rwanda.
While the Rwanda plan specifically was found to be unlawful, the government could, in theory, replicate this in other countries so long as they are considered “safe” for asylum seekers.
The government has not yet sent anyone to Rwanda. The first flight was prevented from taking off by the European court of human rights in June 2022, which said that British courts needed to consider all human rights issues before starting deportations.
A UK high court then decided in December 2022 that the Rwanda plan was lawful.
Catch up on our other coverage of the Rwanda plan:
• Why UK court ruled Rwanda isn’t a safe place to send refugees – and what this means for the government’s immigration plans
• Rwanda deportations: what is the European Court of Human Rights, and why did it stop the UK flight from taking off?
• Suella Braverman is wrong about the UN refugee convention being ‘not fit for purpose’ – here’s why
• The government passed a major immigration law last year – so why is it trying to pass another one?
• ‘A toxic policy with little returns’ – lessons for the UK-Rwanda deal from Australia and the US
Ten asylum seekers from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Vietnam, Sudan and Albania challenged the high court ruling, with the support of the charity Asylum Aid. Their claim was about whether Rwanda meets the legal threshold for being a safe country for asylum seekers.
The court of appeal said it was not and that asylum seekers risked being sent back to their home countries (where they could face persecution), when in fact they may have a good claim for asylum.
The government has since passed the Illegal Migration Act. The law now states that all asylum seekers arriving irregularly (for example, in small boats) must be removed to a safe third country. But now that the Rwanda deal has been ruled unlawful, there are no other countries that have said they would take asylum seekers from the UK.

What happens next?
It is clear that the government’s asylum policies will need rethinking. Should another country now be designated as a safe country and different arrangements put in place, these will probably be subject to further legal challenges, including in the European court of human rights and in British courts.
This ruling is likely to revive discussion about the UK leaving the European convention on human rights (ECHR), which holds the UK to the non-refoulement obligation. Some Conservatives, including the former home secretary Suella Braverman, have argued that leaving the convention would make it easier to pass stronger immigration laws.
But while handing down the supreme court judgment, Lord Reed emphasised that there are obligations towards asylum seekers that go beyond the ECHR. The duty of non-refoulement is part of many other international conventions, and domestic law as well. In other words, exiting the ECHR would not automatically make the Rwanda plan lawful or easier to implement.
The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said that he is working on a new treaty with Rwanda and is prepared to change domestic laws to “do whatever it takes to stop the boats”.
The UK is not the only country to attempt to off-shore asylum processing. Germany and Italy have recently been considering finding new safe third countries to accept asylum seekers as well.
But ensuring these measures comply with human rights obligations is complicated. International law requires states to provide sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or risk to their lives. As this ruling shows, the UK is not going to find an easy way out of these obligations.","Supreme court rules Rwanda plan unlawful: a legal expert explains the judgment, and what happens next",politics
"When Professor Henry Charles “Jatti” Bredekamp began his career as a historian of early Cape Town in South Africa, there was still a commonly held myth that the region’s native people, the Khoisan, had “all but disappeared”. This was in the wake of slavery, colonialism and apartheid, a system of racial segregation by white minority rule.
Bredekamp, who passed away in September 2023, was central in debunking this myth. Aside from his scholarship, he will be remembered for his influential role as a public historian and a conduit for the revival of Khoisan indigenous identity. Many within the movement fondly refer to him as the father of Khoisan revivalism.
Read more: Rock art: how South Africa's coat of arms got to feature an ancient San painting
I interviewed Bredekamp and other “Khoisan revivalists” over several years for my book Khoisan Consciousness. I believe that Bredekamp’s fascinating life story continues to speak to the present moment, when people are proudly identifying as Khoisan and demanding historical justice after being suppressed for centuries.
In fact, Khoisan revivalism’s origins, driving forces and tribulations simply cannot be understood without taking into account Bredekamp’s living legacy: moving conversations on Khoisan history and identity out of the ivory tower of the academy and onto the streets.
Who was Henry Bredekamp?
Bredekamp (born in 1945) served as chief executive of the Iziko Museums of Cape Town, president of the South African national committee of the International Council of Museums and interim chief executive of Robben Island Museum.
He was the first academic historian of colour to be employed by a South African university. In 1976 he left his job as a farm school teacher in the Great Karoo and accepted a position as lecturer-researcher at the University of the Western Cape.
Born and raised in Genadendal, a mission station originally aimed at converting the local Khoisan, Bredekamp had always been aware of his indigenous heritage. He began to assert this lineage more prominently as he established himself in academia.
He went against the current by focusing his research on the Khoisan’s resistance to, and mistreatment by, the colonial oppressors. He steered his career towards public history and spreading awareness about Khoisan history.
A decisive moment occurred during a Khoisan Studies conference in Germany in 1994. Realising he was the only African delegate, Bredekamp made a heartfelt plea to the audience to “recover our past and our traditions”. In essence, he was exploring the possibilities of a collaboration between activism and academia that would kickstart Khoisan revivalism.
The big picture
To understand Khoisan revivalism, one has to back up several centuries. As Europeans settled on South African shores in the mid-1600s, the local Khoisan (also known as Khoi and San) were violently dispossessed of the land they had been living on for centuries. Those who did not perish in their resistance were forcefully assimilated into colonial society. They were made to renounce their indigenous cultures, languages and belief systems. They had to give up their traditional hunter-gatherer and cattle-herding modes of subsistence.
The Khoisan were eventually classified as “Coloured” under the apartheid system of the 1900s. The label described those of mixed “racial” origins and fitted between “White” and “Black” in the racial hierarchy. As a result, most South Africans believed the Khoisan had disappeared, except for a few “pure” communities in the Kalahari Desert.
This “extinction discourse” has especially been challenged since apartheid’s demise in the 1990s. Increasing numbers of people once again proudly call themselves Khoisan, particularly in urban areas.
Khoisan revivalism
Examples of Khoisan revivalism abound in South Africa today. It can be seen in activists occupying ancestral land in Grabouw. In the fight against property development on what some Khoisan revivalists claim is sacred land. In the landmark benefit-sharing agreement recognising Rooibos (a plant famous as a tea) as Khoisan traditional knowledge.

But when did the movement begin? I started looking for answers about a decade ago, focusing on the perspectives of the Khoisan revivalists themselves. Why did they turn to Khoisan identity and what did they hope to achieve?
Khoisan revivalists are a diverse group. There are longstanding disputes over leadership positions, political strategy and the boundaries of Khoisan identity. However, they all arguably seek to instil a sense of pride and ownership among those who once again identify as Khoisan. These core values were articulated by the earliest Khoisan revivalists, not least Bredekamp.
Bredekamp’s influence
Bredekamp was the main organiser of the 1997 Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage Conference in Cape Town. It was distinct from earlier versions because of its active recruitment of Khoisan participants. They brought their grievances and calls for indigenous rights directly to the audience. Bredekamp hailed this as the beginning of a battle for identity. He ensured that the follow-up edition produced concrete policy recommendations.
However, he soon become disheartened by what he regarded as the rise of self-proclaimed Khoisan “chiefs” who didn’t provide solid historical evidence to back up their claims. Some were unscrupulously looking to enrich themselves. Relaying these concerns to the South African government in his consultancy work, Bredekamp insisted that all claims for recognition as Khoisan traditional leaders be thoroughly vetted. He also somewhat surprisingly advised against granting the Khoisan statutory recognition as indigenous people, a contentious issue to this day. As far as Bredekamp was concerned, many had turned the Khoisan revivalist movement into a charade, divorced from its original emphasis on heritage, culture and language.
Considering the bold claims made by some Khoisan leaders, Bredekamp’s concerns remain pertinent. He insisted on historical criticism, while remaining attentive to the plight of a people he understood intimately.
Tensions surrounding decolonisation also remain as relevant as they were in 1997. Some of those Bredekamp influenced actively, such as South African academics June Bam or Yvette Abrahams, seek to include grassroots movements in academia. Taking history to the people and the people to history seems to be Bredekamp’s most enduring legacy.",Henry Bredekamp and the Khoisan: the living legacy of a renowned South African historian,arts + culture
"It’s more than a year since President William Ruto was sworn into office as Kenya’s fifth president. He assumed power at a time when Kenya was beset by rising food and fuel prices, high unemployment and a worrying debt burden.
During the election campaign, Ruto promised to fix an economy afflicted by corruption and ineptitude. He promised to entrench good governance and place the poor at the centre of economic policy. He pledged to address ethnicised politics and to uphold constitutionalism and the rule of law.
Ruto’s promises were significant. The rule of law and constitutionalism are key to economic planning and development, governance and equitable sharing of national resources. They are the guardrails against impunity, democratic backsliding, lawlessness and political instability. Throughout Kenya’s postcolonial period, the political elite have exploited ethnicity to obtain power at the expense of the collective wellbeing and social cohesion. Elite entitlement has also weakened state institutions, leading to corruption and impunity.
I have studied democratic transitions, conflict and state building and elections in Africa. My 2018 book examined how the political class had exploited ethnicity for political and economic advantage, resulting in weak and even dysfunctional state institutions in Kenya.
In his election campaign Ruto identified the major issues that required urgent attention. He addressed issues that needed swift action without constitutional changes, such as thawing the tension between the executive and the judiciary, decoupling the police finances from the executive, and taking port operations back to the coastal city of Mombasa from the inland town of Naivasha. But resolving Kenya’s economic hardships has proved a hard nut to crack, as his 9 November 2023 state of the nation address acknowledged. Just over a year since he was sworn in, Ruto is no nearer to turning the Kenyan ship around.
Economic turbulence
As a candidate, Ruto portrayed himself as an outsider to Kenya’s power matrix who was best placed to improve the living conditions of the poor and excluded. But the economy has not improved under his watch. If anything, living conditions have worsened.
The cost of living is higher after a steep increase in the petrol price and the local currency’s loss of value. Ruto’s government has imposed new and increased taxes on Kenyans, ostensibly to reduce or remove the need for external borrowing.
Read more: William Ruto is now in charge of Kenya’s shaky economy: where to start
The government was quick to remove fuel and food subsidies, but has been slow to address government wastage.
The government key strategy was to subsidise fertiliser to boost harvests and achieve food security. It remains to be seen whether this will happen. More deliberate measures are required to turn around agriculture as the mainstay of the economy.
On the question of centring the poor and marginalised in governance, Ruto focused on the financial sector. The government rolled out the “Hustler Fund” to make credit more affordable.
But the fund’s impact on overall living standards through job creation, for instance, is likely to be cancelled out by a punitive tax regime and a struggling economy.
Rule of law
Ruto’s first public event as president was to approve the appointment of six judges left in limbo by his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta. He also made good on his promise to allocate more funding to the judiciary.
Read more: William Ruto: how Kenya's new president took on powerful political dynasties
However, to entrench the rule of law and constitutionalism calls for more than this. Judicial officers must act with utmost integrity. To affirm equality before the law, errant senior state officers and the political elite must face the law and if found guilty sanctioned decisively.
The Kenyan judiciary is still bedevilled by corruption that impedes access to justice. Disturbingly, it is seen as more inclined to punishing the poor while letting the rich and political elite act with impunity. Ruto himself has obeyed court rulings that went against him, unlike under Kenyatta, when disregard for the law was the norm. Critics, however, including the Law Society of Kenya, have accused his administration of disobeying court orders like his predecessor.
Ruto spoke out against extrajudicial and summary executions and enforced disappearances perfected by the police over the years. He sought to accord the police financial and operational autonomy. Thus he transferred accounting for the police budget to the police as he had promised.
Despite these changes, a culture of impunity and lack of transparency continues to undermine the Kenyan police. Extrajudicial executions continue. The police must be placed under civilian oversight as envisaged under the constitution.
The failure to set up a commission of inquiry into state capture under his predecessor, as promised during campaigns, dented Ruto’s commitment to the fight against corruption. A year later, a commission of inquiry has not been formed and the issue seems to have been abandoned altogether.
It is unlikely that Ruto will fulfil his manifesto unless he reins in runaway corruption and the culprits are held to account. The rule of law demands that proceeds of crime be recovered and offenders charged for economic sabotage. This approach would obviate the need to burden Kenyans with taxes and more borrowing.
National cohesion
Appointments to government positions have been undermined by the age-old problems of recycling appointees, patronage, nepotismand ethnicity. Just as worrying are senior government officials publicly advancing exclusionary ethnic politics with impunity. Ruto must rein them in.
It is also a setback that Ruto acceded to talks to assuage the opposition elite who had resorted to violent protests against his historic victory. These elitist self-serving talks could lead to constitutional amendments creating more political positions under a cynically flawed logic that this approach enhances national cohesion. This is an about turn on Ruto’s part.
Ultimately national cohesion is Ruto’s pressing challenge. Kenya is divided on many fronts – economic, ethnic, regional and religious – a legacy of previous governments. Ruto needs to look beyond ethno-regional appointments. For legitimacy and transformation, he needs to ideologically reconnect with and dignify the “hustler nation”, the disenfranchised constituency that propelled him into power. Bar this, he could face an intensely contested reelection bid like his predecessors.","William Ruto’s first year: he promised to make life easier for Kenyans, but things got worse",politics
"South Africans have a hard time figuring out which foods are unhealthy when they go shopping. But this is about to change.
South African supermarkets currently sell large amounts of unhealthy, ultra-processed foods. Packaged foods in particular have high levels of sugar, salt and saturated fat – all things that are bad for our health.
Research shows that the consumption of these foods is linked to increasing rates of obesity and related diseases such as diabetes.
Many countries have been looking for better labelling systems which help consumers understand whether a product is unhealthy. Countries that have adopted simpler labelling systems have seen consumers making healthier choices about food.
South Africa’s health minister published draft food labelling regulations in April. These will introduce a new labelling scheme, limit advertising of unhealthy foods, and restrict the use of misleading health claims.
The draft regulations propose clearer food labels, which include a new triangle highlighting that the food contains ingredients that are unhealthy. These logos will be placed on the front of a product.
We are part of the working group that advised the Department of Health on front-of-package nutrition labelling, drawing on our expertise in dietetics, nutrition, public health and the law.
We worked with consumers and experts on food labelling, advertising and obesity prevention to create a system designed to work well in South Africa.
But it was a complicated process. This is how we did it.
How do we know which food is unhealthy?
The first step is to find a way to identify unhealthy foods. There are international guidelines on how much sugar, salt and saturated fat people should be eating. These can be used to measure whether a food has too much of these ingredients.
Figuring out whether a food is unhealthy can be tricky, but luckily, other countries around the world have adopted systems like this before, known as nutrient profile models, and we could build on what they had already done.
We looked at what foods were being sold in South African supermarkets. We searched for nutrient profiling models that identify unhealthy foods and work well in other countries and tested these on the South African food supply.
We found that the Chilean model, which focuses only on unhealthy ingredients, sugar, sodium and saturated fat, would work well because it was simple to implement and was able to identify unhealthy products very easily and accurately.
We then modified the Chilean model to make it work for South Africa.
Choosing the right label
The next thing to decide was what kind of label South Africa should use. There are lots of different systems but not all work well.
One uses colour coding. For example, a low level of salt would get a green marker while high sugar would get a red one.
There are also descriptive labels which don’t tell consumers whether the amounts are good or bad – just whether they are present.
Then there are warning labels, often shaped like traffic signs, to alert consumers to the high levels of unhealthy ingredients such as saturated fat, sugar and salt.
We looked at how to design a label that would be understandable to the average South African. We consulted South Africans on each element of the label, from the wording and size to the symbols and colour.
We developed a black triangle – inspired by a danger warning sign – which would stand out on colourful food packages and included pictures so that anyone, even those who can’t read or speak English, would be able to understand them.
The last part of this work was a nationally representative randomised, control trial of different labelling systems. Almost 2,000 people across different income groups and education levels participated.
We also found that the warning labels led to consumers changing their minds about what food they would consider buying.
Earlier this year, South Africans had the opportunity to give comments on the regulations that will see this labelling system implemented. Now it’s up to the department to decide when and how to put these regulations into action.
Hopefully soon all South Africans will be able to see at a glance which foods are bad for their health.",Bad food choices: clearer labels aim to help South Africans pick healthier options,health + medicine
"President William Ruto of Kenya recently announced that Kenya’s borders would be open to visitors from the entirety of Africa, with no visas required, by the end of 2023. He said
When people cannot travel, business people cannot travel, entrepreneurs cannot travel, we all become net losers.
A few days later, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda followed suit, saying all Africans would be able to enter Rwanda without visas.
Neither Kenya nor Rwanda will be the first. By the end of 2022, Benin, The Gambia and Seychelles had already implemented a system of visa-free access for all Africans. Perhaps more will follow soon. Some regions, some sub-regional groups and some bilateral arrangements have also resulted in visa-free access and even passport-free access in certain cases.
Within the broader East African Community, Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya allow cross border travel without passports. Botswana and Namibia recently signed a similar agreement.
Despite this progress, by the end of 2022 only 27% of African routes allowed Africans to travel visa-free.
Actions such as those of Kenya and Rwanda take the African Union’s agenda further. Regularising freer movement of people across African borders is one of the continent’s great developmental challenges. It is one of the flagship projects of the African Union’s Agenda 2063.
But even if all African countries no longer required visas from Africans, this would not necessarily give the visitors a right to apply for jobs, establish a business or build a home in the receiving country. The 2018 African Union Free Movement of Persons protocol aims for full free movement, through three phases – entry, residence and establishment. This includes full economic rights, including employment. It has not been widely ratified, however.
Our new study of migration trends underscores the potential contributions of migration to economic development in the countries of origin and destination. This is realised through the transfer of skills, knowledge and remittances. The study also shows that intra-African migration is firmly rooted in geographical, social and economic ties. Movement is predominantly within regions, and moderately between them.
Free trade and movement of people
African Union policies support freer intracontinental trade, investment and movement of people to promote the continent’s economic, social and political development. The continent has made progress on the aspects of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement that deal with trade and investment. There hasn’t been much progress on the free movement of people. And yet the success of the trade agreement requires freer movement of people.
This interdependence between trade and free movement of people was the focus of the recent Pan-African Forum on Migration held in Gaborone, the Botswana capital. The forum brings together African Union member states, the continent’s regional economic communities, UN agencies and intergovernmental organisations to deliberate on migration and human mobility issues in Africa.
Read more: Free movement of people across Africa: regions are showing how it can work
The conference noted that most African countries had failed to ratify the African Union’s Free Movement of Persons protocol. At the same time, there was evidence of improvements in policies and practices at national, bilateral and multilateral levels that facilitate the freer movement of Africans.
Apart from recent announcements by Rwanda and Kenya, other instances would be a growing number of reciprocal arrangements between countries.
Regional migration a norm
The history of African statehood, with strong social ties across national boundaries, makes regional mobility a norm rather than an exception. This can be seen from the migration routes, mostly found within the same regions and which proceed in both directions.
For example, Burkina Faso to Côte d’Ivoire is the largest migrant route in the continent and within the Economic Community of West Africa (Ecowas) – the economic bloc of 15 west African states. Côte d’Ivoire to Burkina Faso is equally popular. This trend is ubiquitous throughout the continent, except within the Southern African Development Community region, where most migrant routes tend to lead to South Africa.
Among the major regional economic communities, Ecowas has the most intense regional migration. It is followed by the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community. By contrast, Ecowas has the least inter-regional migration while the East African Community has the most.
Variations in development across Africa mean that some countries experience contrasting patterns, particularly in extra-continental migration. While most African migrants migrate to and from other parts of the continent, in middle income countries such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria extra-continental emigration is greater.
Immigration and emigration are generally low in low income countries and higher in middle income countries. In rich countries, people tend not to emigrate. The relatively low level of migration in Africa follows this pattern.
Only 14% of total world emigrants come from Africa. The average migrant density, or percentage of migrants living on the continent, is 1.89% compared to a global average of 3.6% where Europe and North America are at 12% and 16% respectively. African migration is thus not only comparatively low compared with the global averages, but characteristically depicts low income.
High income countries tend to have more immigrants than emigrants. The converse is true for low income regions. Africa as a whole has more emigrants than immigrants, confirming the link between migration and development.
Legal restrictions matter little
Much migration in Africa is impervious to legal constrictions or definitions of national boundaries, and even to logistical constraints. Government dictates succeed in making much of this migration irregular but fail to stop it. Though regional integration and liberalisation of migration rules are helpful, they do not yet solve this challenge.
The main migrant sending country to Kenya is Somalia, despite not being in the same regional economic community. And despite efforts by the government of Kenya to deter Somali migrants to Kenya. The main destination country for Nigerian emigrants in Africa is Cameroon, even though it does not belong to Ecowas.
While African migration governance reforms are making considerable progress it will still be a while till they catch up and are able to deal fairly and rationally with the reality of migration patterns in Africa.

"When health professionals collaborate rather than operating in silos, everyone benefits – patients, families and the health system at large. This is a fact supported by ample research evidence. The professionals reap the benefits, too: staff satisfaction and retention are improved through collaboration.
But in the real world, health professionals and departments often slip into silo mentalities. And silos in healthcare, as US cardiologist Laurence Sparling writes, are bad for healthcare. The “cure”, Sparling argues, is integrated healthcare with “cross-silo dialogue” – collaborative healthcare.
But collaboration is a skill that has to be taught. People don’t automatically know how to work in teams. Instead, they have to develop the competencies to do so. Where better to start than in the professional training they receive?
We are lecturers in the Interprofessional Education Unit at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa. For two years, we tracked the development of students doing the first-year interprofessional theoretical module called Primary Health Care.
As we explain in a recent paper, we tweaked the material dimension (the physical and virtual spaces in which learning and teaching occurs) to help students develop some of the core competencies needed for interprofessional work. These include communication with patients, families, community members and health team members; as well as teamwork competencies with all their complexities and demands.
There were immediate and marked improvements in students’ results. We also saw that students became better at giving each other constructive feedback and working together when needed. These are important skills to harness as they work towards becoming health professionals.
Changing things up
Information is available to modern students with the flick of a finger on the screen. This means the curriculum needs to be constantly evaluated to develop an appropriate learning environment.
One model of education shows that learning environments in the health professions are made up of two parts. There’s the psychosocial dimension, itself made up of three components: the personal, social, and organisational.
The material dimension is the second part and was the major focus of our changes. Starting in 2019, we introduced a few substantial changes to the way we taught and evaluated students. (Not knowing, of course, that in 2020 these sorts of adaptations would become necessary in a pandemic.)
Firstly, we converted the course’s traditional classroom test into an online test. Secondly, we introduced changes to the blog in which students had to post responses to a lecture. Students had previously reported that the topics were too rigid and that they therefore simply regurgitated what lecturers had presented.
Read more: Health professionals work in teams: their training should prepare them
Another change was to an assignment on how social issues are addressed by organisations in nearby communities. Usually, students had to visit those communities. But many had in the past expressed concern about the costs of travelling to communities – most relied on public transport – and their safety. They also struggled with the logistics of coordinating with team members from various departments.
So we instead invited community members into the classroom to share experiences and stories of their communities. Students were, of course, allowed and encouraged to pose questions to these community members. Students interacted with community members to gain insights into the local indigenous knowledge systems, which represent the unique knowledge passed down through generations within a society. This strengthened their use of polite language and clear communication in important interactions, both important for interprofessional communication.
Marked improvements
These innovations brought about immediate improvements in students’ results. At the end of 2019, following the changes from an in-classroom to an online test, the grade point average improved from 49.94% to 81.54%. While a more modest improvement, the average score for the blog went up by 4.53 percentage points. And finally, in the community assignment, the average grade point improved by nearly 12 percentage points.
A number of factors can be credited for these improvements. For instance, the use of storytelling, as in the meetings with community members, has long been thought to aid learning.
We received positive feedback from students. One said:
(This) is a very interesting module because you get to meet other students doing different courses and learn more about their courses, our lecturer made it fun and interesting too.
Another commented:
The course was interesting and it showed how the inter-sectoral collaboration helps society and the health of many patients.
Applying our lessons
Our advice to others lecturing in this field includes these points:
Help students to get comfortable with online environments. Incorporate technology into the first-year curriculum.
To enhance teamwork, give students the chance to critically and productively confront and reflect on their perspectives from early on in a health professions education programme.
Health professional educators must recognise the emergence of a new, digital paradigm in higher education. A comprehensive and integrated approach to education, research and community engagement is required as the healthcare industry transitions to an interprofessional model, pushing us to dismantle barriers and promote teamwork. Continually evaluating programmes to stay ahead of technological advancements helps prepare them for success.",Health professionals need to collaborate.

"The bitter conflict between Israel and Hamas could not have come at a worse time for Egypt. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former military strongman who seized power in 2013 amid the turbulent fallout of the Arab Spring, faces a general election in December.
Beset by economic woes and with a political and humanitarian catastrophe unfolding on his country’s border, it will be an election fraught with risks.
Sisi effectively took power in July 2013, after decades of military dictatorship under Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak’s 30-year reign, which ended in April 2011 during the Arab Spring, was followed by a brief and turbulent interregnum in which a Muslim Brotherhood-backed government led by academic Mohamed Morsi struggled to maintain order.
In July 2013, Sisi removed Morsi from power and won 96% of the vote the following year in an election which drew widespread international criticism. He has not really faced significant political opposition since, but this can’t hide his deep unpopularity with many Egyptians.
At present, Sisi presides over what most experts would say is a contender for the region’s worst performing economy. Annual inflation hit a historic high of 38% in September and the youth unemployment rate is currently running at 17%.
Compounding this economic crisis have been several rounds of currency devaluation and an incoming mandated International Monetary Fund bailout. A harsh IMF-imposed austerity programme will push struggling Egyptians to a level of destitution not seen since the Egyptian bread riots of 1977.
It’s against this unstable background that Sisi will have to fight for reelection. You could be excused for assuming it would be a mere box-ticking exercise, as Sisi has ruled Egypt with an iron fist since ousting the Muslim Brotherhood in July 2013’s brutal coup.
No election has been free and fair since then and Egypt’s independent media has been all but crushed in the interceding years. Opposition parties have either been suppressed or co-opted, while civil society – previously a lively political sphere – now looks back at Mubarak’s dictatorship with a degree of nostalgia.
Initially – and for the first time since Sisi took power – it looked as if he would face a credible opposition. Former MP Ahmed Tantawi, a candidate for the Civil Democratic Movement, made a name for himself as an MP by openly criticising Sisi in parliament and not taking part in the National Dialogue.
This was a Sisi-sponsored initiative which was launched in May 2023. It was presented by the government as an inclusive forum for addressing Egypt’s economic and political challenges – but has been dismissed by critics as merely a vehicle for Sisi’s own agenda.
Tantawi’s campaign gained momentum with support from prominent left-wingers, secularists and even some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in exile, attracted by Tantawi’s stance on releasing political prisoners. There are currently an estimated 40,000 political prisoners in Egypt’s jails, many of them Muslim Brotherhood members.
But Tantawi withdrew his candidacy on October 13, saying that pro-government “thugs” were preventing people from registering their support for his candidacy.
If his abortive campaign wasn’t a direct threat to Sisi, Tantawi’s popularity represents a structural shift in Egyptian politics. Sisi has dealt so badly with Egypt’s economic problems in recent years it has left him vulnerable.
And his habit of incautious statements hasn’t helped – at one point when questioned about the soaring price of okra, an Egyptian staple, he suggested they emulate the followers of the prophet Muhammad and “eat leaves”.
War on the doorstep
With the war in Gaza on Sisi’s doorstep, the regime faces a difficult balancing act. Israel is bent on securing its border no matter the consequences for Egypt. Yet the fallout for Sisi at home could antagonise domestic vulnerabilities. The image of thousands of Gazans dying while Egypt’s Rafah border stays closed could be very harmful for the regime.
Public anger: many Egyptians believe that Sisi is trying to exploit events in Gaza for political gain. EPA-EFE/Mohamed Hossam
Sisi needs to be cautious, given his close relationship with the Israeli government. Egypt has been party to the 16-year-long Israeli blockade of Gaza, enforcing tight controls on the border crossing at Rafah.
But with an election looming he now needs to appease an Egyptian public who are far more sympathetic to the Gazan’s plight than the Israelis. He has attracted widespread criticism from opponents who say his administration has been organising staged protests to piggyback on public sympathy for Palestinians as the death toll from Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip rises.
But the real risk to his administration lies at home with the ever-present threat of Egypt’s well-established Islamist movements. It was a Muslim Brotherhood-sponsored popular uprising at Tahrir Square that toppled Mubarak and handed government to Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood in 2011.
That history now acts as a serious warning for Egypt’s military to never be complacent about the potential threat of Islamist movements. Sisi’s regime has done its utmost to destroy the Brotherhood.
In the ten years since his security forces massacred more than 900 people while violently breaking up mass anti-government sit-ins in Rabaa al-Adawiya and al-Nahda squares in August 2013, tens of thousands have been subject to arbitrary detention without trial or have been sentenced in military courts to lengthy prison terms for dissent.
Perhaps the most shameful exhibition of corrupt use of power was his regime’s treatment of Morsi. The former president died after collapsing inside the defendants “cage” in a Cairo courtroom following six years in solitary confinement.
It is one thing for an incumbent to deal with the failings of a collapsing economy. It is quite another to accommodate an aggrieved public watching a human rights massacre right on its border. If the Sisi regime continues to let this happen on its watch, the opposition will have more ammunition than they have had for years.",Egypt’s strongman president faces election amid economic slump and popular anger over inaction on Gaza,politics
"Leading politicians in the UK, including the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, are of African Indian descent. Other high profile examples include the country’s two most recent home secretaries – Priti Patel, who served from 2019 to 2022, and her successor Suella Braverman, whose tenure ended abruptly on 13 November when she was fired by Sunak.
The home secretary is responsible for law enforcement in England and Wales, national security and immigration.
Sunak’s grandparents left the Punjab in northern India for east Africa in the 1930s. His mother was born in Tanzania and his father in Kenya.
Patel’s parents were immigrants from Uganda; she was born in the UK and cherishes her “deeply held British values.”
Braverman, too, was born in Britain. Her mother grew up in Mauritius, a former French colony, and her father is of Kenyan Indian origin. Braverman calls herself “a child of the British Empire”.
All three are part of the African Indian diaspora. Do they tell us anything about the cohort of people who have had the same experiences as the children of migrants and as part of a diaspora?
I have researched the Indian and African diasporas and found that, in fact, members of diasporas have supple and dynamic political positions. Sunak, Braverman and Patel, among others, provide real life examples of how diasporic people exhibit a wide range of political affiliations, outlooks and opinions.
Some researchers used to believe that diasporic and immigrant communities would function as a “unified polity” – they might all vote the same way. This thinking holds true for many whose work focuses on diasporas and politics – but for those, like me, who research diasporas and migration, there’s been a shift in the last decade or so towards more complex understandings. My research is qualitative, allowing me to delve more deeply into the complexity and idiosyncrasy of diasporic communities.
Diasporas on the move
An African Indian is a member of the Indian diaspora whose family is or has recently been Africa-based.

In the early 1970s, former Ugandan president Idi Amin implemented several hostile, xenophobic policies. In 1972 he ordered all Indian Ugandans to leave the country. Many East African Indians, including those from Tanzania and Kenya, emigrated because of open discrimination against them, heading to countries like Canada and the UK in greater numbers.
It wasn’t just Amin who drove those of Indian descent from the continent. Throughout the 20th century, and especially after the second world war, Britain’s colonial subjects started arriving in the UK. In prior centuries, British imperialism and settler colonialism also spurred many waves of migration, including some of those of the African Indian diaspora.
A diasporic group lives in a geographical location other than their original homeland. Researchers have long been interested in whether members of ethnic or religious diasporas would act as a bloc of unified political actors in influencing their homeland politics or the political climate in their new adoptive countries.
Dynamic, discursive identity
Researchers have highlighted how diasporas can “rediasporise” as children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren move to new locations. Members of diasporas may choose to identify with multiple homelands and host countries over time.
But they may choose to identify with one more than the other or do something else entirely. Take Braverman: although a member of the Indian and African diasporas, she has been outspoken about tightening the UK’s immigration policy. She’s on record as having said:
Look at migration in this country – the largest group of people who overstay are Indian migrants.
Expecting her to have an automatic affiliation with her past isn’t reasonable. Recent scholarly work on diasporic identity has sought to understand identity not as static and “essentialist” but dynamic and discursive. It is also co-constructed, created as an interplay between the individual and the structures – of race, ethnicity, religion, national context and so on – in which she finds herself.
Read more: Idi Amin's 'economic war' victimised Uganda's Africans and Asians alike
Real-life examples like those of Patel, Braverman and Sunak can help diaspora scholars like myself sharpen our analysis of diasporic communities. As scholars, we cannot presume to know how members of diasporas will identify themselves and what their politics will be without doing extensive research. This will build a better understanding of the complex ways that diasporic communities will contribute to society in their new homes.
All we can say for sure is that diasporic identities and identifications are fluid, mobile and creative. Diasporic people cannot be pigeon-holed or put in a box.",India to Africa to the UK: Diasporas don’t influence politics in predictable ways,arts + culture
"Second-ranked South Africa is the only African team to make it to the semi-finals at the 2023 Cricket World Cup. After being banished from the international game in 1970 because of apartheid policies, the country began playing in the tournament in 1992 once democracy was on the cards. Since then South Africa have been semi-finalists often. But what are their chances of winning in 2023 and how does the country’s history live on today? We asked cricket expert Mogammad Sharhidd Taliep five questions.
How have South Africa performed in 2023?
South Africa have performed admirably. Of the eight cricket world cups since 1992, they have reached the semi-finals in four, but have never proceeded to the finals. They “choked” in the crucial stages of their matches and were labelled “chokers”. This is their ninth cup and they are semi-finalists for the fifth time.
What is choking?
Choking is when highly motivated and skilled players deliver sub-optimal (less than ideal) performances when subjected to pressure. Numerous theories have been proposed, but it’s still unclear why this happens.
“Drive theories” suggest that players may increase their arousal or drive to excel under pressure. However, an excessive or non-optimal state of arousal caused by anxiety can disrupt attention, resulting in poor performances.
Then there are the “attentional theories” rooted in the idea that the brain can only allocate a limited amount of resources to paying attention. Anxiety about a match competes with and disrupts the attention required to execute routine tasks.
Consider the 1999 World Cup semi-final against Australia, where Lance Klusener and Allan Donald were run out, leading to South Africa’s loss. South Africa needed just one run to win off four balls with one wicket in hand and a batsman like Klusener would typically secure that run. The immense pressure resulted in them choking at the most crucial part of the match. A similar situation unfolded in the 2015 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand.
Read more: Women's Cricket World Cup 2022: how South Africa fares on the world stage
But labelling South Africa as the only team that chokes in cricket world cups is unfair. Since 1992, England, despite winning in 2019, had only reached the semi-finals once before that. And their performance this year displayed several instances of underperforming on the big stage. New Zealand, who played in six of the eight World Cup semi-finals since 1992, have never won the tournament.
What must South Africa do to win?
The opposite of choking is to possess “big match temperament”. This is when an individual or team rises to the occasion of a significant match or critical moment. The player takes ownership and often performs beyond expectations. South Africa need to exhibit big match temperament to secure a World Cup title.
This involves meticulous planning, flawless execution, applying consistent pressure and staying one step ahead. Calmness must prevail in height-of-pressure moments, fostering belief in themselves and their preparation. Two quotes from South African Rugby World Cup flyhalf Handré Pollard sum up the mindset needed in those crucial moments:
In those moments you trust your process and the hours you’ve put in.
and
That is what you live for.
In my view, when South African cricketers relish these pressure moments, triumph awaits.
Transformation is a heated issue – how has it shaped the 2023 team?
Transformation in South African sport is a government goal. The Transformation Charter defines it as:
Increased access and opportunities for all South Africans, including women, persons with disabilities, youth, children and the elderly to sport and recreation opportunities; the socio-economic benefits of sport are harnessed; and the constitutional right to sport is recognised.
Transformation of the national cricket team is just a small part of the agenda, but it receives the most media attention. Despite negative publicity, often around the target or quota system, South Africa’s national team has continued to perform well. A series of research papers show that transformation has generally changed the face of South African cricket without compromising performance at a senior and junior provincial level. South Africa has come a long way since 1992 when Omar Henry was the only Cricket World Cup squad member who wasn’t white.
Although there are barriers for the progression of cricketers and the country is still far away from truly transforming the sport, a lot of work has been done by Cricket South Africa at all levels. These successes are often not publicised. For example, about 60 Hub and Regional Performance Centres have been established across the country. These academy-like programmes aim to develop talent from previously disadvantaged communities by providing coaching, mentorship, transport, high level matches and opportunities.
What does it take to make the national team?
I’ll answer that by highlighting eight key factors that shape the pathway to becoming an elite player:
Parental support and mentorship: Parents are the first contact for budding cricketers. It’s essential to educate parents on how to effectively support and nurture their children’s talent.
Early diversification: Recent analysis suggests that world-class athletes engage in a range of physical and sport activities during their early years. This helps develop different muscle groups, movement patterns and anticipation skills. It prevents boredom and reduces the risk of overuse injuries. So playing many different kinds of sports is a benefit.
Dedicated training: It’s important to have the appropriate training. Research indicates that, by the age of 15, elite-level cricket batters had accumulated about 2,000 hours of structured, coach-led training. This is aside from playing in informal settings.
Intrinsic development: Players should have the freedom to develop naturally and this should be emphasised over rigid coaching instructions. Allowing individual styles and techniques to evolve encourages unique talents in both batting and bowling. It makes players less prone to choking.
Fast bowlers’ preservation: Shoulder and back injuries are common among young fast bowlers. They should prioritise preserving their bodies and perfecting their variations rather than consistently bowling at maximum speed. Especially during their growing years.
Physical conditioning and resistance training: Often overlooked at the junior level, strength or weight training from an early age promotes well-rounded physical development.
Mental toughness: Mental toughness and especially resilience have been found to be among the most important psychological skills of elite players. The ability to bounce back from disappointments and poor performances through learning and adjusting techniques and strategies is vital.
Enjoyment and passion: Above all, both the child and the parent should find joy in the sport and foster a genuine love for playing.",Cricket World Cup 2023: what it’ll take for South Africa to win,arts + culture
"South Africa has had a number of outbreaks of animal diseases in recent months that suggest there are weaknesses in the country’s biosecurity system – the measures in place to reduce the risk of infectious diseases being transmitted to crops, livestock and poultry.
The outbreaks pose a major challenge for South Africa’s domestic animal farming sector. Fears of weaknesses in the system have been raised by agribusiness for some time, suggesting that pressures and concerns are mounting.
Biosecurity breaches are not unique to South Africa. They have become a significant challenge globally. It’s not easy to put a monetary figure on it, but reports of disease outbreaks across the world, and indeed in South Africa, suggest the problem has intensified.
In South Africa, reports about foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, African swine fever in pigs and avian influenza in poultry have become frequent. But few countries have had to deal with these disease outbreaks almost simultaneously, as South Africa has.
In 2022, six of South Africa’s nine provinces reported foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. This was the first time in the country’s history that the disease had been spread this wide.
The situation remains critical.
All these outbreaks have had a notable impact on South African agricultural exports, and the growth prospects of the sector. For example, South Africa’s beef exports for 2022 were down by 12% year-on-year, according to data from Trade Map. This decline was primarily due to the temporary closures of various export markets following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in South Africa. Farmers are being hit hard.
Livestock and poultry account for roughly half of agriculture’s gross value added.
Based on this history and the experiences of the agricultural sector, there is concern that South Africa’s biosecurity breaches signal serious capacity challenges in farm biosecurity measures and the country’s veterinary and related support services (mainly the laboratories) that control the movement of livestock and vaccine production.
The South African government, organised agriculture and industry bodies should work together closely to address the country’s biosecurity challenges.
Disease outbreaks
On 4 November this year, the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development announced it was investigating a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in one district.
This means the issue that was identified a year ago remains a challenge. These outbreaks weigh heavily on the cattle industry’s fortunes. The beef industry accounts for a sizable share of the South African agricultural economy, and is positioned to absorb new entrant farmers in the sector. Beef exports were about 1% of agricultural exports, valued at US$151 million, in 2022, according to Trade Map.
The sheep industry was also affected by the 2022 outbreak. China, a significant market for South African wool, suspended imports. This resulted in a 21% year-on-year decline in the export value of wool in 2022, to US$337 million, according to Trade Map data. Wool still made up 3% of South Africa’s record agricultural export value of US$12.8 billion in 2022.
China’s official reason for the suspension was the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. But it might not be all that clear cut. China may also have had capacity issues at its ports at the time because of the tail-end effects of COVID-19 and the restrictions there.
China has a unique protocol to handle wool shipments and avoid any contamination during a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in South Africa. This was agreed in 2019 after an outbreak.
In 2022 South Africa’s pig industry was put under fresh pressures. Towards the end of the year outbreaks of African swine fever were reported. The disease remains a challenge.
Most recently, the focus has been on avian influenza. More than a hundred commercial poultry facilities have reported cases. There are major losses for breeders of layers and broilers. As a result, there has been a spike in imports of fertilised eggs to rebuild the parent stock flock. This is key for stabilising the industry.

Major producers have announced serious losses. Consumers are also seeing a rise in the price of eggs.
Policy considerations
The growth prospects of farming businesses remain at risk if there are no material improvements in biosecurity. This is particularly true for sub-sectors that are crucial for inclusive growth. For example, the National Agricultural Marketing Council estimates suggest that black farmers account for 18%, 13% and 34% of wool, mohair and cattle production, respectively.
The department of land and agriculture should consider earmarking a share of its annual budget for emergencies to deal with biosecurity risks. These funds should be used only in the case of notifiable animal disease outbreaks and under strict rules and in concurrence with the South African National Treasury. This will be necessary to control animal movements, procure vaccines and permit vaccination in certain areas, employ additional staff and compensate producers when animals must be culled.
Notably, the government should also work the private sector on vaccine manufacturing as national laboratories have experienced failures in the recent past, thus weakening disease control efforts. Additionally, government should increase the number of veterinarians and animal health technicians.
Also necessary is the repair and maintenance of international fences, which fail to keep wild animals and infected animals from neighbouring countries out of South Africa. Collaboration between Public Works and the National Treasury in this respect is critical.
In essence, most interventions require better management, coordination, restructuring of departments, and investment in fencing, new laboratory equipment and vaccine production.
Beyond the technical matters, the relationship between the regulators and farmers should also be improved so that disease outbreaks can be managed collaboratively with no hostility.",Diseases on farms in South Africa: recent outbreaks point to weaknesses in the system,business + economy
"The relationship between Ghanaian citizens and officers of its police service is a tenuous one. Recent reports by the research network Afrobarometer show a decline in trust between citizens and officers amid complaints of harassment and bribery. There have also been accusations of the police being used by the political hierarchy to stifle dissent by force during protests. The Conversation’s Godfred Akoto Boafo speaks to criminologist Justice Tankebe about the reasons behind the breakdown in trust and ways to improve it.
Do Ghana’s police serve the interests of citizens?
We can think of these interests in terms of people’s expectations of policing. My research has identified four dimensions of these interests.
First is the effective use of police authority to protect citizens from violence and threats to their constitutional rights. Fear of crime is a reasonable indication of police effectiveness. Data from Afrobarometer shows that, in 2002, 16.8% of Ghanaians feared becoming victims of crime at their homes. This declined to 9.2% in 2012 but has now risen to 24.6%.
The second dimension is lawful police conduct. Police officers do not serve this interest when they engage in illegal practices such as robbery, unlawful killing of civilians or bribery. A recent survey funded by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime showed that 53.2% of Ghanaians who interacted with police officers paid them a bribe.
Thirdly, policing serves the interests of Ghanaians when it treats people equally. Simply put, people’s social class, ethnicity, religious beliefs, or political affiliation should not influence the decisions of police officers.
Finally, policing must listen to citizens, explain decisions to them, treat them with respect and care for their wellbeing. Fair treatment communicates symbolic messages about a person’s social standing and inclusion; hence it matters greatly to citizens. A survey of Ghanaians shows a little over half of them think the police treat them fairly.
Why are the police struggling to serve Ghanaians?
The first reason is the colonial roots of the Ghanaian police, which continue to show in three ways:
police officers expect people to accept decisions without question
officers are subservient to elites, who have undue influence on police work
the police are not sufficiently accountable to local communities.
Some officers try to curry favour with politicians in the hope of future advantages such as promotions. This is exemplified in the leaked audio of an alleged plot to replace Ghana’s police chief, which is now the subject of a parliamentary investigation.
Beyond the colonial legacy, political interference means there’s a risk of unsuitable people being recruited to the police. They may lack the appropriate motivation and ethical inclination. The adequacy of training and the quality of supervision are also doubtful. The absence of credible accountability structures also limits scrutiny of how officers behave.
Finally, the behaviours that supervisors model to frontline officers can affect how they interact with citizens. For example, a survey found that officers who felt their superiors treated them with disrespect and partiality were less committed to fair treatment of the public.
What are the consequences for democracy?
Police scholar David Bayley has argued that the quality of policing is an important measure of democratic governance. A country cannot claim to be democratic if the police arbitrarily arrest people, humiliate them, suppress political dissent, and exceed their legal mandate.
When citizens lose faith in democracy, they become tolerant of military interventions. So efforts at democratic consolidation must pay attention to the state of the police. Indeed, some scholars argue that this may help save democracy from the threat of the military taking control.
This matters greatly in a sub-region of increasing political instability and terrorism threat.
What reforms are required?
First, there is a need for ideological re-orientation. The Ghana police say their mandate is to “prevent and detect crime, to apprehend offenders and to maintain public order and safety of persons and properties”. This is indistinguishable from their colonial mandate. Unsurprisingly, police tactics are militaristic and prioritise order over the democratic rights of citizens.
A democratically oriented police service would view its mandate as creating conditions for citizens to enjoy their constitutional rights. It would ask: “how can we facilitate protests and protect protesters?” rather than “what reasons can we find to prevent a protest?”.
The second area for reform is police accountability. Ghanaians have limited information about the internal accountability mechanisms, such as what happens to complaints filed against police officers. Research evidence shows the lack of appropriate signals from the Ghana Police Service deters officers from reporting unethical colleagues.
As I have previously argued, the Ghana Police Service needs independent democratic oversight.
Thirdly, reforms are required to insulate the police from political capture. Ghana’s constitution grants the president the right to appoint the police chief. The president also effectively controls the promotion of senior officers through the police council. The same processes as those used in recruitment into civil service should be considered. Yet this is unlikely to make a difference unless police officers are fully committed to their democratic mandate. They must maintain ethical relationships with politicians and other elites who seek to capture the state for their personal interests.
Finally, there is a need to develop a culture of evidence-based policing. This requires a closer relationship between the police and academics who have the methodological tools to support the police in evaluating the effects of their interventions.",Ghanaians don’t trust the police.

"“How come we’ve never heard of this beautiful instrument until now?” This was posted by a first-year college student to my world music course discussion board recently. He voiced what many of his peers probably felt after watching the extraordinary documentary Ballaké Sissoko, Kora Tales.
The film follows Sissoko, a world class musical artist, from his home in Bamako, Mali to a sacred well and baobab tree in The Gambia on the Atlantic coast. In the film, the award-winning Sissoko revisits his childhood homeland and traces the origins of the instrument that became his destiny.
Sissoko is a jeli (called a griot by outsiders) – a hereditary oral historian and musician attached to the ruling class. Like generations before him, he plays the kora, a unique kind of harp that’s indigenous to the western African savannah. It has 21 strings and is played with four fingers. And it can create dazzling, dense musical textures as well as thin shimmering veneers that accompany the delivery of deep oral history. It is one of the most sophisticated handmade musical instruments in the world, both in its musical capabilities and the depth of its tradition.
Ballaké Sissoko: Kora Tales is a beautifully made film that should be seen by everyone interested in African culture and history.
Kora’s global spread
If you haven’t heard of the kora, it’s not for lack of exposure. Dozens and dozens of kora albums have been released since Gambian Jali Nyama Suso’s debut solo album in 1972. The kora has won more Grammy Awards in the World/Global Music category than the sitar. An album featuring the kora with the BBC Symphonic Orchestra was released in 2023. The reach of the kora beyond western Africa is expansive. It can be heard on recordings by musicians across the world.
I first heard the kora on a 1973 album by Gambian Alhaji Bai Konte. It was an early formative experience that put me on the path towards becoming an ethnomusicologist. In the 1980s, Senegalese-American kora player Djimo Kouyate inspired me to study regional differences in kora playing in four neighbouring countries. I wound up in Bamako, living three doors down from Ballaké Sissoko, studying with Sidiki Diabaté (father of Toumani), who lived two doors down. That became the basis of my first book in 2000, Mande Music.
The history
Constructed from a large half calabash, cowhide, thick wooden neck and leather tuning loops and strings (now nylon), the kora is several centuries old. Precursors go back much further.
Sissoko (right) with Fabouly Diébaté in Senegal. Screengrab/Ballaké Sissoko: Kora Tales/Vimeo
It is intimately intertwined with the history of the Mande homeland along the Niger River, slicing through modern-day Mali and Guinea. This chiefdom rose to power in the 1200s when the legendary Sunjata conquered an oppressive king, Soumaoro Kante, with the help of neighbouring allies. Kante owned the primordial bala (also called balafon), a magical xylophone, which was passed on to the jeli (griot) of Sunjata. His name was Balla Faséké Kouyaté and his direct descendants guard that very instrument in a hut in northeastern Guinea.
In 2008 Unesco declared the instrument a site of intangible cultural heritage and today a museum is being constructed on the site. At its height, the Mande empire extended across much of western Africa and its mines supplied most of the gold circulating in Europe. A visit to Mecca by Mande king Mansa Musa in the 1300s secured his reputation as one of the wealthiest people in the history of the world. Migrations westward to the Senegambia region led to the development of a related language and culture, Mandinka.
Sissoko at home with his mother Luntandi Sakiliba in Bamako, Mali. Screengrab/Ballaké Sissoko: Kora Tales/Vimeo
Just as the bala (Mande xylophone) has origins in Mali in the 1200s, the kora has origins in the Kaabu federation of the Senegambian Mandinka in the 1700s. Traditionally, jelis have the exclusive right to play both of these instruments. Many origin stories of musical instruments in Africa refer to a jinn (genie) first bringing it out. So it is with the kora.
What the film is about
One of my favourite lines in the documentary comes from Sissoko’s aunt Kadiatou Diabaté, herself a jeli:
This person before you, he was born with the kora. The seventh generation of his lineage. Even if you just touch him, out comes the sound of one of the strings.
Travelling by car, Sissoko leaves his capital city Bamako for a voyage of over 1,000km west to the birthplace of the kora on the Gambian coastline. All of this was part of the Mande empire at its height, as far as the northern reaches of the Niger River at Timbuktu. Sissoko stops at Sibi, where Sunjata is said to have united his armies, made pacts and created the governing constitution of what would become the largest empire in Africa.
The cinematography of the countryside, much of it from aerial drones, is magnificent. Passing through southern Senegal, they cross the Casamance River by boat for a visit with kora master Malan Diébaté. This is kora country and a half dozen kora players appear, singing the praises of Sissoko and his lineage.
Malan Diébaté leads a performance in Darsilame, Senegal. Screengrab/Ballaké Sissoko: Kora Tales/Vimeo
They are accompanied by the women in their extended family tapping out a diasporic source of the signature Cuban clave pattern.
Diébaté recounts the supernatural origins of the kora, and Sissoko takes off for that very spot, Sanementereng in The Gambia. In one sense all musical instruments are magical, given the impact they may have on our lives. Widespread oral traditions attribute the origins of the kora to this specific place on the Gambian coast.

"“One-chance” is the name Nigerians use for a form of robbery that takes place in both public and private vehicles when people accept the offer of a ride. It is an organised crime, perpetrated by people who work together, using a strategy of hailing passengers into their waiting vehicle. They capitalise on the transport needs of passengers, especially during rush hours in the morning and the evenings. In Lagos, an estimated eight million commuters and five million vehicles use the roads and bridges connecting the mainland and island.
At rush hours Lagos is jam-packed. An average of 264 cars per kilometre negotiate the city compared to the world average of 11 cars per kilometre. This encourages commuters to use private vehicles, known locally as kabukabu, which pick up passengers randomly. The vehicles fill up faster than vehicles at designated stops, which makes them attractive to commuters in a rush. They are usually cheaper too.
Once passengers are inside their vehicle, the one-chance gang members instruct victims to comply, using coercion and violence. They take the victims’ possessions and may hurt them physically and traumatise them emotionally. Passengers are sometimes thrown off a speeding vehicle. There have even been cases of victims being killed.
Residents of Lagos dread being victims of one-chance. Official statistics are hard to come by, but media reportage most likely increases the fear of the crime. The Lagos state government in 2022 listed it as a crime of major concern.
Public transport safety is a field of study worldwide, but one-chance public transport criminality in Lagos, Nigeria has not received much attention. This is why we studied how the criminals operate and what their victims experience. We also looked at the social situations which facilitate the crime and commuters’ awareness of safety in the Lagos State transport corridor.
Understanding the strategies and victimisation experiences may be a first step towards prevention and an appropriate institutional response. For example, the law enforcement authorities could map one-chance crime hot-spots. Commuters could make some changes to their behaviour too.
Our study
In our study we administered in-depth interviews to 10 people who had been victims of one-chance robberies. They came from different walks of life; six were men and four were women, ranging in age from 25 to 65.
Our questions probed into issues of routine, methods of operation, timing of operations, and victimisation experience, among others. We wanted to distil the strategies and tricks deployed in trapping commuters.
The findings showed that similar techniques were used in most cases. Timing was important. Many of the cases reported by our participants happened around 9pm to 11.30pm. Very few happened during the day or early in the morning between 4am and 6am. Each operation lasted from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on what targets had to offer the gang.
Most of the participants were either returning home from their workplaces or going somewhere for a visit or a meeting when they were picked up at bus stops. Others were picked up at the roadside and not from designated places. This put them at greater risk although they may have hoped to pay less for a ride. Vehicles that pick up passengers at undesignated spots usually charge a lower fare.
Different types of vehicles and buses, both Lagos yellow buses and private buses and cars, are used for one-chance. Inside the bus, gang members take up seats in such a way that the victim is forced to sit where he or she can easily be robbed.
Sometimes the criminals were dressed to look like office workers, and included women among them, so that a passenger would feel safer boarding.
Participants reported two types of experience: physical violence and loss of valuables. Some reported being traumatised after the incident. In many of the cases, the attack took place within 5 to 15 minutes of the pickup but might last for up to an hour. We think this could be so that the robbers could act before the situation got suspicious or plans were disrupted.
Victims’ coping strategies
Victims have found ways to cope with the experience or reduce the prospect of it happening again.
Some said they were always very observant and followed their instincts when boarding a vehicle. Some had resolved to hail a private taxi if they worked late in the office or to rely on their colleagues or bosses to drop them at a convenient point. Others would sleep in the office. Some put their faith in God to get them safely home.

The way forward
In planning urban transport safety, the Lagos State government needs to constantly inform the public of dangerous places and where not to board public transportation.
Installation of closed circuit cameras in crime hot-spots with regular security patrols would reduce the opportunity for one-chance criminality.
Commuters could also alter their routines so as to be less predictable. This might reduce the chances of becoming victims.
Commuters should use designated motor parks where commercial vehicles are registered to operate.
The Lagos State government needs to understand the transport needs of residents and come up with a more functional and efficient public transport system.",‘One-chance’ in Lagos: how criminal gangs rob city commuters,arts + culture
"First staged in 2015, the globally touted Nyege Nyege Festival in Uganda is an annual four-day dance party featuring hundreds of deejays. It’s also a major tourism drawcard that caters to 15,000-odd lovers of electronic dance music. However, Nyege Nyege is most often in the headlines for creating controversy. Last year the event, the first after a three-year break due to COVID-19, nearly didn’t happen. Uganda’s parliament banned it – and not for the first time – on the grounds that it promoted “sexual immorality”. Eventually the prime minister gave it the go-ahead. This year the festival, being held at a new venue, has faced controversy over the threat of terrorist attacks. Tourism lecturer Amos Ochieng has studied the festival and explains its ongoing dilemmas.
Why is the event in the headlines this year?
There were terror threat warnings just a few days before the opening of this year’s festival. Considering that a sizeable number of event goers come from abroad, the US warned its citizens to avoid crowded places, including this year’s event. The UK also issued a warning.
Reports have speculated there is to be strengthened security at the event. Interestingly, however, moral outrage about the festival from Ugandan leaders has not been an issue this year.
Why did it change venues again this year?
The event was moved into Jinja city (it was previously 30-40km outside the city) on the shores of Lake Victoria for several reasons. The new venue can accommodate larger crowds, which will generate more revenue for all stakeholders. It’s also more convenient in that it’s closer to the city centre, with more accommodation options, and it offers other attractions and activities in the area – such as sport, cruises and bird watching.
Why has Nyege Nyege been so controversial in the past?
The festival promotes electronic dance music and was established by promoters Arlen Dilsizian and Derek Debru to meet the demand among young Ugandans for all-night dance partying. Even though Nyege Nyege promoted the theme of environmental conservation and inclusivity last year, it was the subject of moral outrage and heated debate. The controversy has a lot to do with its name – Nyege Nyege.
In the Luganda language of Uganda, “nyege nyege” is interpreted as an irresistible urge to dance. One dictionary defnition says it means “an intensive feeling for the urgency in need for intimacy, closure and physical exploration”. However, in the Kiswahili language of the larger region, “nyege nyege” is slang for “horny, horny” and is used in relation to sexual urges. As a contemporary and popular musical event, Nyege Nyege is, according to one study, intended to “create intense and affective aesthetic experiences for its participants”.
During a parliamentary session last year a member of parliament ardently argued for its cancellation. Parliamentarians, religious and opinion leaders, human rights activists and some government officials publicly questioned the integrity of the event for being a potential breeding ground for sexual immorality. The Speaker of the Ugandan parliament declared it banned just over a week before it was to be held.
Controversially, in just less than 24 hours, an emergency meeting chaired by the prime minister cleared the event to take place. She argued that it was too late to cancel as thousands of tourists were expected for the festival. A banning would cause financial losses. She assured the public that the event would take place under strict guidelines, including no underage guests and no nudity.
The roots of the resistance to the festival lie in the fact that Uganda is a conservative country with a strong position of Christian morality and a wish to preserve “traditional values”. Homosexuality, for example, is outlawed in the country under increasingly strict laws.
In 2018, the Nyege Nyege Festival was cancelled by Uganda’s ethics and integrity minister on moral grounds but was later cleared to continue. This could be seen as part of government’s commitment to turn Ugandan music and local entertainment into economic goods forming a core part of the creative tourism industry segment. After all, the production of specialised music has a cohesive role in creating local identities and touristic images and products. These can be promoted and marketed to diversify Uganda’s tourism product base.
There is an urgent need for Uganda to develop regulatory guidelines instead of being reactionary.
What role does the festival play for tourism?
Music and dance are a growing part of the creative tourism industry. Like other festivals and cultural displays they are part of the everyday spaces of leisure, a source of artistic expression and audience pleasure.
Allowing Nyege Nyege to continue reflects Uganda’s preparedness to handle large numbers of tourists. The event will provide opportunities for the sale of locally produced materials for improved local livelihoods. As an opportunity for cross-cultural interactions, Ugandan cultures could feature prominently.
The electronic dance music community is a new niche with enthusiastic promoters recruiting new members to build a like-minded community. This community boasts diverse audiences with diverse artistic tastes and consists of smaller (local, translocal or virtual) groups of musicians, fans, promoters and the like. So the festival is a growing leisure activity in Uganda with a moral dilemma.
What is the future for an event like Nyege Nyege?
Uganda, with its strong religious and cultural foundation, will continue to challenge the promotion of Nyege Nyege.
Local music articulates issues around identity, conformity, performance, status, community, subculture, high culture, technology, power relations, education, place and space. How best can all these aspects be integrated to embrace the electronic dance music community for a sustainable tourism industry in Uganda – while still preserving the sanctity of cultural values?
The government departments and agencies responsible for tourism should work with the organisers to draw the best alternatives to promote and conduct the event, and still preserve our cultures.

"For the past 16 years South Africans have dreaded rolling power cuts euphemistically dubbed “loadshedding”. These are caused by the ailing state power entity Eskom’s crumbling infrastructure and its over-reliance on ageing and poorly maintained coal-fired power stations. Loadshedding has worsened in 2023, with some areas experiencing power cuts for up to 10 hours a day.
This crisis affects every aspect of the country’s economy, including its vibrant tourism sector. Tourism is a vital contributor to the South African economy. In 2019 the country welcomed over 10 million foreign visitors. The sector contributed up to 6.4% of the gross domestic product along with 1.5 million jobs (9.3% of total jobs).
These figures have contracted significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visitors are returning. But the financial recovery and viability of the sector, which is composed mainly of small businesses, continues to be hampered by the electricity crisis.
If tourism businesses are to literally and figuratively keep the lights on they must transition towards renewable electricity generation. There are three reasons for this. First, providing consistent electricity to their guests is essential for any tourism business. Second, renewable energy is less damaging to the environment than coal-based generation and its greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, customers are increasingly aware of environmental concerns. Many demand more sustainable tourism products and adjust their travel choices accordingly.
We are a team of interdisciplinary researchers with interests in tourism, sustainability and the environment who recently collaborated on a research paper that studied South Africa’s potential to break away from old forms of energy generation towards low carbon electricity generation. There are already some positive moves in this direction. But much more remains to be done. This will require the tourism industry and other economic sectors to step up.
What’s already being done
Some work is already being done to enhance the tourism sector’s environmental sustainability. The government’s Tourism Environmental Implementation Plan, published in 2021, facilitates greater participation by tourism establishments in renewable electricity generation and saving.
Read more: South Africa's power crisis will continue until 2025 - and blackouts will take 5 years to phase out
One initiative included in the plan is the tourism department’s Green Tourism Incentive Programme. It supports small tourism businesses by providing free energy and water audits. These can lead to improved efficiencies and the introduction of subsidised renewable energy systems. So far, 111 renewable energy projects have been funded. The Green Tourism Incentive Programme pays approximately two-thirds of investments. Individual businesses finance the remaining third.
In the private sector, the City Lodge hotel group shows what can be achieved by installing renewable energy systems. In 2020, solar panels generated just over 10% of the electricity requirements of the group’s 59 hotels.
Nature-based tourism is one of the mainstays of South African tourism products. South African National Parks, the body that manages national parks, has installed solar PV panels at 19 of its 21 parks. It is also putting in place other low-carbon strategies as well as climate adaptation plans.

Getting it done
While these examples are encouraging, they remain limited in size and scope. Most innovation in South Africa towards sustainable energy generation has been self-funded as a business survival strategy to deal with the consequences of power cuts. The shift to renewable electricity, along with its greenhouse gas and air pollution benefits, is a happy coincidence.
A broader transition, helped by access to finance on terms that can smooth its way, is necessary to bring about a system change for tourism. This can place the sector on a path that decouples it from coal-based electricity. It will also ensure that small businesses can adopt renewable electricity.
The green energy shift in tourism is already taking place in developed economies in Europe. Turkey is another encouraging example. It has introduced a sustainable tourism programme; solar PV panels are used widely by businesses and households alike.
Through shifting the tourism sector to renewable energy, tourism in South Africa can be part of the just transition too. This transition must include small and community-based tourism players. And, while tourism must play its part, other economic sectors should also step up.
Supportive South African policies are indispensable in developing an enabling environment for sustainability transitions. The state and its institutions must take greater responsibility and accountability to advance the social sustainability of energy policies. One way this could happen is by making the Green Tourism Incentive Programme more accessible to tourism enterprises across the country.

"Research shows that people with disabilities have always been largely excluded and marginalised in societies across the world.
Over time, the language used to describe disability has generally become more positive and inclusive. Many activists advocate for the use of “people/persons with disabilities” and not the “handicapped” or “disabled”. But this language remains negative for many Indigenous people around the world. To them the word “disability” is stigmatising because they don’t have such a term in their vocabulary. It’s also a misrepresentation of their traditional beliefs regarding impairments.
In traditional village life, the Xhosa community of AmaBomvane in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa do not see disability in a person. Their rituals do not allow people to discriminate – their worldview is based on collectivism and ubuntu. Ubuntu is an African philosophy that promotes the common good of society and includes humaneness; each person is an integral part of society.
In many other cultures persons with disabilities are seen to differ from the “norm”.
For my PhD in health sciences rehabilitation, I spent three years studying the experiences of people with disabilities when they underwent Xhosa rituals and traditions. I wanted to know how rituals contribute to health and wellbeing.
Read more: Can the philosophy of ubuntu help provide a way to face health crises?
I found that good health and wellbeing relies on rituals, which are the essence of life among the Bomvana people. And that good health is for everybody, including people with disabilities. They cannot be denied health, because everyone is equal. This offers lessons in the inclusion and participation of people with disabilities.
The study
For my study, 50 people were selected for interviews and focus groups from three rural villages – Gusi, Hobeni and Xhora in the district of Elliotdale – with the assistance of chiefs and community members. They included people over the age of 18 with disabilities (who were able to answer questions), indigenous knowledge holders (elders), caregivers and parents of persons with disabilities, traditional birth attendants, traditional healers, a traditional circumcision surgeon and a social worker.

The Bomvana people are associated with the red ochre they use to decorate their faces and the beautiful beaded red blankets worn when attending traditional functions. AmaBomvane have a strong belief system which strengthens cultural continuity, ensuring there will be no lack in leadership to perform rituals and traditions. Their participation in social organisation ensures that traditional knowledge, transmitted orally, is not lost as it moulds the character of the people.
My study focused on three rituals which mark important stages in a person’s life:
Efukwini (behind the door), which provides a sacred space for giving birth in which the mother and infant remain separate from the rest of the household for 10 days to protect the child from evil forces. When the nursing mother is in seclusion, AmaXhosa believe that the child is connected to the ancestors for its protection and recognition as a member of the family, including all people with disabilities.
Intonjane (female initiation rite), marking a girl’s rite of passage to womanhood, performed between her first menstruation and her wedding. The ritual is done for all young women, regardless of whether they are disabled.
Ulwaluko (traditional male circumcision), in which boys learn about acquiring their identity and social responsibility as men. A person with disability belongs to the community and must not be excluded from this ritual. All boys must be taught to become men, regardless of disabilities.
The findings
AmaBomvane treat people with disabilities with dignity and respect within the context of their rituals. If they didn’t, it’s believed, the rituals would be rejected by the ancestors and misfortune would arise. The Bomvana also believe illness can be prevented through performing rituals to the ancestors, who are seen as intermediaries between God and people. The rituals confer health, stability and resilience.
I found that rituals provide a safe space for people with disability by virtue of being inclusive. This encourages respect and compassion.
The Bomvana understanding of disability is also linked to spirituality and traditional knowledge systems. Disability is seen as outside the body:
Disability is like a blanket any other spirit is wearing.
The Bomvana do not see disability as the real person, saying:
The soul is not disabled.
There are, however, also negative attitudes towards persons with disabilities in the broader Bomvana village society outside of the rituals. This, I believe, is a result of colonial influence and western thinking. AmaBomvane told me, for example, that in the old days missionaries were against men going for circumcision. They did not understand the importance of the ritual to the Xhosa. If one is not circumcised, one remains a “boy” and is forbidden from participating in communal decisions and social events.
Talking about these negative attitudes, one traditional healer told me:
Their treatment is very bad in the community. At times they become projects of people they are living with. Their grant money is misused by their carers.
The grant is given by the state to provide for the basic needs of persons with disabilities who are unable to work.
One caregiver said:
They are not supported as they should be. For example, there are these children we are looking after, and when they go home for holidays, we buy them clothes, but when they come back, the clothes … have been taken by siblings that are not disabled.
While in the villages the old values are still respected, I found indications that with changing times and fractured family units, the concept of ubuntu is under threat.
What this means
The AmaBomvane belief in ubuntu – social justice and fairness – could be a model for the inclusion of persons with disabilities and their rights. The Bomvana case could encourage others to embrace a spirituality that supports resilience and stability. It’s a humane way of viewing disability.

This matters because ubuntu contains all the key aspects of South Africa’s constitutional bill of rights that teaches that “all are equal before the law”.

"African governments are seeking an extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) beyond 2025. The law was enacted in 2000 to “encourage increased trade and investment between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa”. We asked David Luke, who specialises in African trade policy and trade negotiations, what benefits Agoa has brought for qualifying African countries and how it can be improved.
To what extent has the Agoa goal been achieved?
The duty- and quota-free access to the US market granted by Agoa has helped in boosting trade and investment between sub-Saharan Africa and the US. Many of the qualifying African countries have recorded specific successes in goods exported under Agoa to the US. These include textiles and apparel from Kenya, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Lesotho, Ghana and Madagascar. In Kenya, for instance, the apparel-dominated Agoa sales have grown from US$55 million in 2001 to US$603 million in 2022, accounting for 67.6% of the country’s total exports to the US.
South Africa has sub-Saharan Africa’s most diversified export list. The value of its automotive sales to the US has increased by 447.3% between 2001 and 2022 under Agoa. South Africa’s vehicle exports to the US increased by 1,643.6% in the first year of Agoa, from 853 units in 2000 to 14,873 units in 2001.
Other country specific successes include Ghana where non-oil products like plant roots, textiles and travel goods are accessing the US market under Agoa. Ghana’s exports to the US grew from US$206 million in 2000 to US$2.76 bilion in 2022, though only 26% of this trade was under Agoa.
The Agoa window has also lifted chocolate and basket-weaving materials from Mauritius; buckwheat, travel goods and musical instruments from Mali (suspended in 2022); Mozambique’s sugar, nuts and tobacco; and Togo’s wheat, legumes and fruit juices.
Perhaps Ethiopia, which was suspended from Agoa in January 2022, best exemplifies the impact of the trade window on Africa’s industrialisation.
According to the World Bank, Ethiopia has attracted the world’s attention with its ambitious industrialisation plans, particularly through its industrial parks. The industrial parks, which mainly produce textiles and garments, have thrived on the duty-free and quota-free access to the US market.
In less than a decade, Ethiopia’s industrial parks created 90,000 direct jobs, predominantly for women aged 18 to 25 years. Employment of this group is typically associated with a range of positive societal and economic spillovers.
Ethiopia’s exports to the US increased from US$29 million to US$525 million in 2020, 45.3% of it under Agoa. Textile and garment exports that up to 2014 accounted for just 10% of the trade grew steadily to 69% over the period.
The industrial parks attracted 66 foreign firms investing about US$740 million since 2014/15, with Agoa as the major driver of the sector’s investment and growth of its jobs and export earnings.
What’s been the impact of Agoa on Africa’s exports?
Between 2017 and 2020, the US became the third largest destination for Africa’s industrial products after the European Union and intra-African trade. Agoa is part of the reason for this. That means Agoa has stimulated significant value addition in the region, traditionally known for exporting unprocessed items.
The positive impact on value chains explains why African countries such as Kenya, Lesotho and Mauritius have put so much diplomatic capital, and on occasion lobbying funding, into articulating a continuing case for Agoa’s renewal.
The African countries have exploited the window to sell their manufactured goods to the US. This is the kind of trade that really matters for Africa’s goal of economic transformation through “manufacturing, industrialisation and value addition”.
By comparison, during the 2017-2020 period, 87% of Africa’s exports to China were fuels, ores and metals.
What kind of agreement are the US and Kenya negotiating?
The US and Kenya are not negotiating a bilateral free trade area agreement as is commonly misunderstood. What they are negotiating is a strategic trade and investment partnership which cannot be described as a free trade agreement as it does not include new market access arrangements.
The main goal of the partnership is to increase investment and to promote inclusive economic growth. It is meant to benefit workers, consumers and businesses (including small ones). Its other aim is to support African regional economic integration.
Given the prevailing global economic disparities, if African countries are to develop, they need trade concessions like Agoa, not bilateral reciprocal free trade agreements.
How can Agoa be made more beneficial to sub-Saharan Africa?
First, Agoa must be extended for at least 20 years. This will ensure predictability of the market access concession and boost confidence among investors of a sufficient time frame to recoup investments. Second, north African countries ought to be included in Agoa. This will extend Agoa to all African countries and support the trade integration of the continent through the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement.
Thirdly, Agoa should stop punishing investors for mistakes of governments. It is unfortunate that countries that fail to meet the Agoa eligibility requirements, which include governance and human rights standards, are suspended from the scheme. This penalises private firms that invest and trade and the people who are dependent on these firms for jobs. But the US is not likely to change the eligibility requirements.",Africa-US trade: Agoa deal expires in 2025 - an expert unpacks what it’s achieved in 23 years,business + economy
"On the shores of Lake Turkana in east Africa, about 5,000 to 4,000 years ago, pastoralists buried their dead in communal cemeteries that were marked by stone circles and pillars. The north-west Kenya “pillar sites” were built around the same time as Stonehenge in the UK. But these places have a different story to tell: about how mortuary traditions reflect people’s environments, behaviours and reactions to change.
The burial sites appeared at a time of major environmental and economic change in the region. The Sahara, which received enough rainfall 9,000-7,000 years ago to sustain populations of fisher-hunter-gatherers and pastoralists, was drying, causing groups of people to move east and south. Even in eastern Africa, lake levels were dropping dramatically; grassy plains were expanding. Around Lake Turkana, people began herding animals in addition to fishing and foraging.
At several of the pillar sites around Lake Turkana, archaeologists have found that hundreds of people were ceremonially interred under large, circular platform mounds. Many of those individuals were found wearing remarkable colourful stone beads, some as part of necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other jewellery worn, for example, around the waist. These beautiful personal ornaments include blue-green amazonite, soft pink zeolite, deep red chalcedony, purple fluorite and green talc, among other minerals and rocks.
I study relationships between humans and their environments, especially at times of major economic transformations, using scientific techniques applied to archaeology. I recently led a team of experts in geology and archaeology of the region to conduct the first comprehensive mineralogical analysis of the Turkana stone beads.
The focus of our study was to discover what types of minerals and rocks the early herders had used to make adornments, and where these materials came from.
This kind of information can tell archaeologists about the role of artefacts in the society that used them.
Wearing beads
Humans have been making and wearing beads for over 140,000 years. Beads are one of the oldest forms of symbolism and are often used as adornment in a culture. Wearing something on your body is an expressive choice that can have many meanings, such as protection, acknowledgement of friendships and bonds, status or role in society. Personal ornaments like beads may indicate a common cultural understanding.
Analysis of beads in archaeological sites has shown that we can learn many things from them.
At the Turkana pillar sites, the stone bead tradition was clearly important, partly because of the number of beads found accompanying burials, and partly because the practice persisted for hundreds of years.
Knowing the range of materials helps us understand landscape use in the past: where people were buried, where they watered their animals, seasonal movements for grazing, special yearly trips to significant places and other movements. Pastoralists recorded or marked their worlds by what they left behind and what they took with them. Patterns in the composition of the bead collections may indicate there was communication and exchange of objects across the region.
Sorting the stone beads
Of the six pillar sites that have been excavated by archaeologists, three have yielded substantial assemblages of stone beads: Lothagam North, Manemanya and Jarigole. Our team began by sorting the stone beads by site, and by their mineral and rock types.
Our study identified the mineral characteristics of 806 stone beads. We looked at properties like specific gravity, crystal and molecular structure, and the characteristic emissions that are particular to certain minerals.
Stone beads from the Jarigole pillar site. Carla Klehm, Author provided (no reuse)
What we found was a strikingly diverse set of beads that varied by site. The visual characteristics of some of the beads – colour, lustre and so on – may have made them particularly valuable or had a special meaning economically, socially, spiritually or symbolically. Their source and workability may also have given them a certain value.
Pink zeolites and turquoise amazonites were the most common stone beads at the site of Lothagam North, comprising over three-quarters of the assemblage. This was very similar to the site of Jarigole, located across the lake. The sites are hundreds of kilometres apart, with Lake Turkana in between – suggesting a cultural connection between them.
Beads from a single burial at Manemanya. Carla Klehm, Author provided (no reuse)
In contrast, the kinds of beads at Manemanya were different: mostly softer and paler pink and off-white calcite beads that were quite large. Further, while at Lothagam North there often were just a few beads found with any individual, one person at Manemanya was buried with over 300 stone beads and over 10,000 ostrich eggshell beads.
This suggests that although having stone beads was a commonality across the sites, distinctions – and distinct meanings for different people – did exist.
Sourcing stones
We also wanted to know whether the beads were produced from local sources (within a few days’ walk) or acquired through long-distance journeys or trade. Sourcing allows us to partially reconstruct how the earliest pastoralists moved around the landscape during the year.
A survey of the areas west of Lake Turkana and a search of the published literature on the geology of the region identified places where these materials might have come from.
Lake Turkana pillar sites. Carla Klehm. Map by Mark Helper
There are possible sources for most of these materials within about 150km of the pillar sites. Limestone rocks may have been procured easily near the lake. Some of the tougher materials, like the chalcedonies, could have been carried to the lake area by rivers, to be picked up perhaps by someone watering cattle or fetching water from a stream. Other minerals come from a specific source. The variety of bead types demonstrates that people knew their landscape well.
Sometimes, they went out of their way to get certain minerals, or perhaps traded for them. The closest known sources for amazonite and fluorite are, respectively,  225 km, in southern Ethiopia; and  350 km, near the modern city of Eldoret, Kenya.
These suggest that bead making was not just a casual affair; material selection was intentional.
Local landscapes
Early herders in the Turkana Basin obtained materials from both local and distant places, and shaped them into personal adornments. These stone beads were placed with the dead, in numbers and combinations that differed by individual and place. We don’t yet fully know what they meant – but future research in the Turkana Basin will continue to explore the lives and legacies of these pioneering herders as they negotiated new environmental and social landscapes.

"We are so fortunate to share the world with a huge diversity of creatures. For me, some of the most fascinating are reptiles and amphibians. Collectively called herpetofauna, reptiles and amphibians are ectotherms; they rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature.
A person like me who works with these groups of animals is called a herpetologist. Among the reptiles and amphibians, my special interest is in snakes. I’ve always been interested in reptiles, from the days when I would chase common flat lizards in the Motobo Hills in Zimbabwe, where I grew up, and interact with snakes and other animals at our local rehabilitation centre.
Still, if somebody had told my teenage self that my job would entail working with snakes and encouraging other people to appreciate them, I never would have believed them. I didn’t even know you could make a career out of working with reptiles. Today, I’m studying towards my PhD in herpetology (which is technically a degree in ecology and conservation) while also working with a snake conservation organisation in South Africa.
Learning about snakes
Most people will be familiar with zoology, the branch of biology that focuses on the study of all animals. Some animals have their own speciality within the discipline of zoology. Herps (a slang term for herpetofauna) are one example.
There are over 4,000 species of snakes around the world. Each species has a unique adaptation to its own environment. Some snakes, like puff adders, are scentless as a way to camouflage themselves from predators. Others, like southern African pythons, show maternal care, which is very unusual for snakes and much more common in mammals and birds.

These unique adaptations have allowed snakes to thrive in different environments. This makes them a great model in science: herpetologists can ask questions about their physiology, evolution, ecology and biology.
For anyone looking to become a herpetologist, a basic zoology degree will get you started. Most universities will have someone who specialises in teaching herpetology or someone who can point you in the right direction. Volunteering at institutions that have reptiles, like zoos, is also a great way to get some experience working with them. Once you get to postgraduate level, you can specialise in one of many different topics in herpetology and apply different techniques to answer questions that you are curious about.
As a specialist in reptiles and amphibians, you can merge that interest with other disciplines like photography, law or conservation, and this can open up many job opportunities. You can also pursue further research at a university, become a lecturer or school teacher, work at a zoo or become a museum curator. There are many options to explore.
My research
I completed my MSc in 2017 and my research focused on the evolution of diet in a group of snakes called lamprophiids. I loved learning about how diverse snakes are in the food they eat. For my PhD, I wanted my research to have a real-world application, so I waited until 2021 to start after getting some work experience in conservation.

My current research focuses on the way that snakes behave (behavioural ecology) to answer some of the bigger question of what leads snakes to bite people. Another year and I will have some answers for you on this.

Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease according to the World Health Organization and affects millions of people around the world. When natural spaces are transformed and destroyed, many animals, like snakes, go looking for food and shelter – often in people’s homes. Many people are afraid of snakes, so encounters often lead to conflict as people try to kill the animals and get bitten in the process.
I am also fortunate to work for a non-profit organisation, Save The Snakes, which allows me to educate people about snakes and do my part to conserve them by applying my research. My job includes researching information on snakes that live in different parts of South Africa and assessing threats to them, like habitat transformation, learning more about the relationship between humans and snakes, conducting fieldwork and running experiments to understand more about the behaviour and ecology of snakes.
The circle of life
I’m also passionate about education.
Learning about the world of snakes has allowed me to appreciate the natural world in a unique way. As predators and prey, snakes are an emblem of the circle of life. One of my favourite activities is going out at night looking for them (called “herping”) and watching them display different behaviours. After the summer rains, frogs and insects come out and the snake predators follow. When I take these moments to observe the world around me I feel fortunate to appreciate these animals in a way most people don’t. This is the feeling I like to share in my education efforts.

Some of my favourite moments in my current job have involved seeing the change in people’s perceptions about snakes. Snakes have been feared for many generations because of misinformation. Most snakes are harmless. They don’t chase people, and they stay hidden much of the time. By sharing the correct information about snakes, we show that fear can be changed to curiosity and that creates more motivation to learn about them.","Do you like snakes, lizards and frogs?

"Nigeria’s new works minister, David Umahi, is pushing for the use of rigid pavement in road construction, as against the flexible pavement predominantly in use. This, as the minister noted, is due to the precarious state of flexible pavements in the country.
A rigid pavement is a road surface overlaid with reinforced concrete, while a flexible or asphalt one has a bituminous (tar) overlay.
Asphalt roads are the most common type of paved roads in Nigeria. Examples include the Lagos-Ibadan, Port Harcourt-Enugu, Lokoja-Abuja and Abuja-Kaduna expressways. Concrete roads include the Kaba-Obajana road in Kogi State and Apapa-Oshodi road in Lagos State.
Road infrastructure is essential in modern economies. Economic growth and development requires mobility and accessibility.
As a professor of engineering who has researched the use of reinforced concrete and asphalt on Nigerian roads, I offer some insights into the issues raised by the minister’s decision.
The choice is between additional service and higher cost or reduced service and lower cost. This is a design challenge. The decision is not only technical, but also political.
However, there is no data to speak categorically on whether concrete pavement is better than flexible pavement for Nigeria.
Comparison of flexible and rigid pavements
Rigid pavements are generally more expensive and difficult to install and maintain. They’re made out of a cement concrete with a base, sub base and subgrade underlay. Unlike flexible pavement, rigid pavements have a high flexural strength, making every layer virtually immune to bending under pressure. Flexural strength is the material’s ability to resist deformation under load.
Flexible pavement is designed to bend and deflect according to external factors like traffic loads. Essentially, it is more adaptable to the elements to which it’s exposed. The initial cost of construction is low and with excellent regular maintenance, it has a lifespan of about 10-15 years. Regular maintenance is required for this type of pavement, and repair work is fairly easy.
Flexible pavements have low initial cost, but higher maintenance cost.
Comparatively, rigid pavements have high initial cost, but low maintenance cost.
Asphalt has a relatively smaller surface area of subgrade compared to a wider surface area for reinforced concrete. Subgrade is the material underneath the pavement structure.
Flexible pavements usually last for 10 to 15 years while rigid pavements last for 25 to 30 years.
There’s a higher water penetration rate for flexible pavement but lower rate for rigid pavement. The longer moisture remains in a flexible (asphalt) pavement structure the more likely pavement failure will occur. In particular, the continuous presence of moisture in a pavement subgrade can significantly affect the subgrade’s modulus and reduce pavement performance. Subgrade modulus is a conceptual relationship between applied pressure and deflection for a plate resting on an elastic support system.
Night driving is better on rigid pavements due to the light coloured surface.
Extreme weather like high temperature affects flexible pavements but not rigid pavements. In flexible pavements, temperature fluctuations have a significant impact on structural performance, including stress and strain.
Noise pollution is also high on flexible pavements but lower on rigid pavements.
The way to go
The choice of any type of pavement depends on the life cycle and costs of materials, which include initial construction cost, maintenance and repair cost, and cost associated with environment factors such as emissions and energy consumption.
Consequently, a life cycle cost analysis should be carried out before choosing a pavement type.
A well-designed road will provide the intended level of service at an acceptable level of safety. It will also reflect local values and policy, which will vary from location to location, and it will place appropriate importance on cost, environmental values and appearance. These should guide the country’s decision on the issue.
Asphalt roads (flexible pavement) have less initial cost of construction, lower construction and repair periods, they are quicker to repair, absorb traffic noise and can be recycled, thereby reducing waste. However, asphalt has a short life span, requires frequent maintenance, is less able to carry heavy traffic and so is more suitable for light traffic in residential streets and rural roads. It also has a greater carbon imprint, which is detrimental to the environment, as a result of bitumen production.
Concrete roads have a heavy construction cost, longer construction period due to the time required for curing, and longer repair times. They have a longer life span, low maintenance cost, high durability, and high load bearing capability, ideal for heavy traffic areas such as highways, ports and airports. Concrete roads have a lower carbon imprint from the production of cement, and are less prone to developing pot holes, reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions.",Concrete versus asphalt for Nigeria’s roads: which is better?,science + tech
"Distance education first appeared in the United States in the 1800s. At the time, students received the relevant material through the post and then returned it to the institution.
Scholars in the field say that distance education is now in its “fifth generation”. This means that, like so much else in the world, knowledge is delivered via the internet. Students want to be able to access learning materials at a time and place that’s convenient to them. Flexibility is key.
The increasingly important role of multimedia in higher education was emphasised during the COVID pandemic. Universities that previously held in-person classes switched to digital, remote learning. Even though open distance universities were hypothetically better equipped for the switch, since their model meant they already used technology and digital tools, many were more comfortable with a blended learning approach (some in-person teaching and some remote teaching).
It is now nearly four years since COVID was declared a global pandemic. Much of society, and much of higher education, has returned to “normal”.
But it’s important that higher education institutions don’t waste the lessons learned during the height of the pandemic about the powerful role that multimedia can play in learning and teaching. This is especially the case for open distance education since it offers a way to improve access to higher education for people from diverse societies and backgrounds.
So, for my PhD in education, I set out to develop a post-pandemic multimedia framework for teaching and learning in open distance institutions in South Africa.
The study identified a number of challenges that might keep the country’s open distance institutions from adopting such a framework. One is insufficient access by both students and institutions, though mostly students, to information and communication technology infrastructure such as capable networks, cloud infrastructure, and the relevant hardware and software tools.
Institutions also need to regularly update their software and ensure that their staff are constantly learning new skills as technologies change. Crucially, institutional websites must be zero-rated – service providers should not charge for access and use of specific internet pages. It also emerged from my research that lecturers found WhatsApp to be a powerful tool for learning and teaching.
The study
The majority of students in the country’s higher education institutions are enrolled through the contact mode. But 370,891 (34.5% of all students) are pursuing their education through distance learning.
To conduct the study, I engaged with 15 participants from three selected support departments (four deans, eight lecturers from four selected colleges, and three support staff participants) at an open distance higher learning institution in South Africa.
Read more: Remote teaching in Nigeria and South Africa got a COVID wake-up call -- how to capitalise on it
I handed out questionnaires and conducted interviews with these participants. I wanted to know what their skill levels were regarding multimedia technologies and how they used those technologies during the pandemic. I also analysed relevant institutional documents.
One participant emphasised that not only were multimedia solutions made available to staff, but academics were trained to use these. The institution’s multimedia centre, they said, also equipped some staff with “audiovisual tools of the trade such as podcast equipment”.
Several participants emphasised how valuable WhatsApp had been as a platform, particularly for “fast communication” with students. It was also, they said, a good way to build relationships with students. One told me that Facebook was their go-to platform for general communication but that “for module-related content, WhatsApp was the main platform we used”.
What comes next
Based on the results of my study, I propose that collaborative leadership is needed to ensure there are proper frameworks for multimedia as teaching and learning tools at open distance institutions. This can serve as a guide to institutions for incorporating multimedia; it helps to organise the structuring of video content, audio, graphics and text in a manner that enhances teaching.
The South African government (particularly the department of higher education and training), individual researchers, educational institutions and the private sector all have a role to play.
Read more: Online teaching and learning is not just for pandemics and it can help solve old problems
The government, for instance, should recruit and engage mobile network service providers to install fibre and internet connectivity, even in the country’s rural areas. This will broaden access. Integrating solar systems into electricity supply, especially but not limited to these areas, is also important.
Watching and downloading videos requires a great deal of data. So, zero-rating all websites related to education is another way to create access. In this way students can access all the resources they need, not just static, text-based modules.",Multimedia is key to distance education: I built a model South African universities can use,education
"On his official visit to Kenya, King Charles III acknowledged Britain’s colonial era “wrongdoings”. He also paid tribute to Kenyan soldiers who had participated in the first and second world wars on behalf of Britain. His visit coincided with Kenya’s 60th independence anniversary.
British colonial rule in Kenya was characterised by injustices. Among these were forceful dispossession of indigenous people’s land, torture, detention and brutal suppression of anti-colonial movements.
An excerpt from King Charles’s speech is useful to decipher the value and implications of his apology, from an international law perspective:
The wrongdoings of the past are a cause of the greatest sorrow and the deepest regret. There were abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence committed against Kenyans as they waged, as you said at the United Nations, a painful struggle for independence and sovereignty – and for that, there can be no excuse. In coming back to Kenya, it matters greatly to me that I should deepen my own understanding of these wrongs, and that I meet some of those whose lives and communities were so grievously affected.
The legacy of colonial rule is similarly apparent in other east African contexts. German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier recently extended a similar gesture in Tanzania over the brutal suppression of anti-colonial movements. In 2020, Belgium’s King Philippe expressed regrets about the colonial legacy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Are public acknowledgements like this just symbolic? Or do they have the potential to elicit reparations under international law?
As an academic and practitioner of international law and transitional justice, I have worked (as a visiting professional) in the Office of Public Counsel for Victims at the International Criminal Court.
It is my view that these public acknowledgements of colonial legacy in east Africa by Britain, German and Belgium can be classified under the broad framework of transitional justice, as opposed to mere international relations or politics.
Transitional justice generally implies both the judicial and non-judicial measures aimed at redressing legacies of human rights abuses. It is different from the traditional view on justice as it provides avenues to redress mass atrocity, in this case, colonial legacies. Measures under transitional justice range from the formation of truth commissions to criminal prosecution and reparation programmes. The process of memorialisation through museums and monuments is another important tool in the transitional justice process.
The options
International human rights law provides the standards on transitional justice. It has four pillars: prosecutions, truth telling (truth commissions), reparations and institutional reform.
Truth commissions: These are temporary quasi-judicial inquiries. They are normally commissioned by states to investigate previous wrongdoings and make recommendations.
Belgium, for instance, set up a Special Parliamentary Commission to deal with the country’s colonial legacy. It was the first of its kind in Europe and ended in December 2022. No concrete proposals came out of it. The government did not show serious interest in the work of the commission.
Criminal prosecutions: This is not a real option because colonial crimes are state crimes. The International Criminal Court deals with cases of individuals, not states. And it only considers crimes committed after the Rome Statute came into force, in 2002.
Reparative justice: Apologies and memorials are forms of reparation. But these are incomplete without material aspects like restitution or monetary compensation to a group of victims. International law does not offer specific guidance on reparations for colonial state crimes.
Britain could be guided on reparations by UN’s Articles on responsibility of states (for internationally wrongful acts) adopted by the International Law Commission in 2001. The UN also has a set of basic principles on remedies for victims of human rights violations.
Reparations for state colonial crimes should take full account of individual and collective harm. But this has never been done before.
The governments in the former colonies are politically oriented to maintain friendly bilateral relations with the western powers. Thus the voices of the families of victims of colonial atrocities remain peripheral.
International law and the framework of transitional justice push the envelope beyond symbolism, and offer potential for actual reparations, but also foster reconciliation.
Why it matters
There is a historical background to this admission of guilt and commitment to Kenya. In the past decade, Kenyan groups have filed a series of colonial-era compensation claims in the UK, relating to Britain’s brutal suppression of the Mau Mau insurgency. In 2013, when Kenya was marking its 50th independence anniversary, the UK Foreign Office announced it would be settling claims of Kenyans relating to the Mau Mau events. The British government also promised to fund the construction of a memorial in Nairobi. This was largely a negotiated settlement out of court, and not an outcome of a judicial inquiry.
King Charles III’s recent apology is not an isolated event, but rather a reflection of the progress Kenya has made in seeking redress.",British king acknowledges colonial atrocities in Kenya – here’s what could happen next,politics
"The World Bank issued a statement on 8 August 2023, announcing that it had effectively suspended all new public financing to Uganda over concerns with the country’s anti-homosexuality law, which “fundamentally contradicts the World Bank Group’s values”.
According to Human Rights Watch, the anti-homosexuality act violates multiple fundamental rights guaranteed under Uganda’s constitution and a number of international human rights agreements which the government of Uganda has signed. The act was first proposed in March 2023, and adopted by the Ugandan parliament in early May.
The World Bank, and the diplomatic and donor community writ large, follow closely what happens in Ugandan politics.
It took three months for the bank to react and issue the statement. This was fairly fast. The World Bank is usually a slow mover because of its due diligence bureaucracy. It takes time to have members on board behind political statements. So, because it took only three months, one could argue there was an internal push from central people or member states. This says something about the bank’s ambiguous relationship to its client states’ domestic politics and how it deals with political concerns.
The World Bank has an apolitical mandate. Article IV (section 10) of the Bank’s articles of agreement says
the Bank and its officers shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned.
On the other hand, its mission statement “to end extreme poverty and promote prosperity in a sustainable way” is not only political but requires political action.
As a social anthropologist, I have researched international aid in eastern Africa and particularly followed the relationship between the World Bank and Uganda since 2006.
The World Bank’s engagement with Uganda has always filtered through into the country’s domestic affairs. In my view, the recent suspension of funding over the anti-homosexuality law was in keeping with that tradition. The previous interventions in domestic issues involved presidential term limits, market reforms and governance reforms.
I believe the interventions should be viewed in the context of informal and indirect means through which the World Bank seeks to control its clients. Despite its insistence on national ownership of its projects, the World Bank uses its lending portfolio to govern and control its clients.
Presidential term limits
In 2005/6, the World Bank cut its loans to Uganda by 10% due to technical issues referred to as “prior actions” which the government had failed to implement before signing the loan agreement, causing expenditure overruns in the public administration budget. The real reason for cutting aid, in my opinion, was politics. The World Bank was frustrated when President Yoweri Museveni lifted the presidential term limit to seek re-election again.
The recent reaction to the anti-homosexuality act thus demonstrates a continuity in how the World Bank responds to domestic political affairs. It also shows a change, as the reaction is not rooted in politics or concealed as a form of techno-bureaucracy, but explicitly linked to values. The tone is different. The World Bank always sought to appear neutral on values. It suggests to me that the institution’s most prominent owners and shareholders have weighed in.
Market reforms
During the structural adjustment era, lasting until around 2000, World Bank loans to Uganda and other recipients came with strict conditions and ready-made policies baked into them. The bank could make loans conditional on the recipient state privatising state-owned enterprises or liberalising the economy. Those are highly political and ideological measures in the client state’s sovereign domain. For instance, Museveni bought into a lot of the structural reform programmes which included market reforms and power sector development. This is in contrast to Ethiopia, which until very recently has been considered more resistant to World Bank proposed reforms.
A later disbursement tactic was to make concessional lending contingent on the government making its own national poverty reduction strategy. Once that was endorsed by the bank, the bank would provide financial assistance to help the government implement its own strategy. This bypassed questions about external governance and policy imposition.
Governance reforms
As the World Bank withdrew from direct control, it aimed to retain power through other means – while respecting national ownership. Whatever is proposed by aid recipients still needs the bank’s endorsement to become effective.
The World Bank’s power and control don’t just lie in the ability to decide what to fund and when to stop funding. It is just as much a result of the bank’s ability to frame partnership and the conditions under which the recipient exercises the freedom it has been granted.
One of these freedoms concerns the formulation of national development policy. National policy needs the bank’s approval to become effective. So the client government should do as the bank wants it to do, but voluntarily.
The bank can govern at a distance. The policies funded by the bank are defined as the state’s own polices.
The World Bank, and indeed donors in general, always emphasise the principle of national ownership, even as their policies undermine it. This gives donors the advantage of placing the responsibility for failure on their clients if aid programmes do not succeed. And indirect governance structures imply that client governments appear both as objects to be shaped by donor policies and as subjects with whom agreements are made.
What next
How the World Bank governs and relates to its clients (not just in Uganda) has changed over time, from direct power and policy imposition to more indirect and tacit dynamics concealed as mutual partnership.
The fact that the Ugandan government went on to adopt the anti-homosexuality bill, despite the bank’s indirect governance and technocratic micromanagement, can thus be read as a failure of the partnership arrangement and the bank’s ability to govern at a distance.
Nor did lobbying and arm-twisting by international donors, the US and the EU among others, persuade the government to kill the bill.
More actors and emerging economies are becoming increasingly active as sources of financing, such as China, the Gulf states, Russia, and private actors. These are potentially replacing traditional western donors, marking a shift to more geopolitical rivalry on the African continent. But few lunches are free, and the new, emerging actors pose new conditions and expectations. The World Bank, given its commitment to transparency and democracy, may after all be preferable.
A return to more direct, conditionality-based governance, as practised during the structural adjustment era, could be a way to deal with values, but could jeopardise national ownership and mutual partnership.",World Bank suspension of Uganda funds over anti-homosexuality law: what this says about the struggle over funds and sovereignty,politics
"Israel is widely recognized as having highly sophisticated intelligence capabilities, both in terms of its ability to collect information about potential threats within its own country and outside of it. And so as details unfold about the full extent of Hamas’ unprecedented and surprise attack on 20 Israeli towns and several army bases on Oct. 7, 2023, the question lingers: How did Israel fail to piece together clues about this large-scale and highly complex plot in advance?
Israeli intelligence did detect some suspicious activity on Hamas militant networks before the attack, The New York Times reported on Oct. 10, 2023. But the warning wasn’t acted upon or fully understood in its entirety – similar to what happened in the United States shortly before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
“Intelligence analysis is like putting a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle together from individual pieces of intelligence every day and trying to make judgments for policymakers to actually do something with those insights,” said Javed Ali, a counterterrorism and intelligence scholar who spent years working in U.S. intelligence.
We spoke with Ali to try to better understand how Israeli intelligence works and the potential gaps in the system that paved the way for the Hamas incursion.
1. What questions did you have as you watched the attacks unfold?
This took an enormous amount of deliberate and careful planning, and Hamas must have gone to great lengths to conceal the plotting from Israeli intelligence. This plotting may indeed have been hidden as the plot was being coordinated.
Because of the attack’s advanced features, I also thought that Iran almost certainly played a role in supporting the operation – although some U.S. officials have so far said they do not have intelligence evidence of that happening.
Finally, Hamas is on Israel’s doorstep. One would think Israel could better understand what is happening in Gaza and the West Bank, as opposed to 1,000 miles away in Iran. How did Israel not see something this advanced right next door? Some Israeli officials have said they believed Hamas was already deterred by recent Israeli counterterrorism operations, and that the group lacked the capability to launch an attack on the scope and scale of what occurred.
2. How does Israeli intelligence work, and how is it regarded internationally?
Israel has one of the most capable and sophisticated intelligence enterprises at the international level. The current design and functioning of Israel’s intelligence system broadly mirrors that in the U.S., with respect to roles and responsibilities.
In Israel, Shin Bet is the Israeli domestic security service, so the equivalent of the FBI, which monitors threats within the country. On the foreign security side, Israel has Mossad, which is equivalent to the CIA. Third, there is an Israeli military intelligence agency, similar to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency – and there are other, smaller organizations within military intelligence that are focused on different intelligence issues.
Like most Western countries, Israel relies on a combination of different intelligence sources. This includes recruiting people to provide intelligence agencies with the sensitive information they have direct access to, which is known as human intelligence – think spies. There is what is called signals intelligence, which can be different forms of electronic communications like phone calls, emails or texts that the Israelis gain access to. Then there is imagery intelligence, which could be a satellite, for example, that captures photos of, say, militant training camps or equipment.
A fourth kind of intelligence is open source, or publicly available information that is already out there for anyone to get, such as internet chat forums. While I was winding down my work in intelligence a few years ago, there was a shift to seeing much more publicly available intelligence than other kinds of traditional intelligence.

3. How does Israel’s intelligence system differ from the US system?
Unlike the U.S., one thing that Israel doesn’t have is an overall intelligence coordinator, a single representative who knows about and oversees all of the different intelligence components.
The U.S. system has a director of national intelligence position, who runs the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which was created in 2004. These were both recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, after it found that the U.S. approach to intelligence was too fragmented across different agencies and offices.
So, when there are tough issues that no one agency could resolve on its own, or analytic differences in intelligence, you need an independent office of experts to help work through those issues. That’s what this office does.
I spent several years working within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. In one of my jobs there, I reported to the director of national intelligence.
There is no equivalent to that central office and function in Israel. In my opinion, Israel might consider down the road how a comprehensive intelligence coordinator could help avoid this challenge in the future.

4. What role does the US have in monitoring threats to Israel, if any?
The U.S. and Israel have a very strong intelligence relationship. That partnership is bilateral, meaning it is just between the two countries. It is not part of a larger international group of countries that share intelligence.
The U.S. also has a broader intelligence partnership, known as “Five Eyes,” with Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Nevertheless, the general rule in these strong bilateral relationships is that when one side picks up intelligence about threats to the other, it should automatically get passed on.
This may be a case where the U.S. is shifting its intelligence priorities to other parts of the world, like Ukraine, Russia and China. As a result, we may not have had significant intelligence on this particular Hamas plot, and so there was nothing to pass to Israel to warn them.",How did Israeli intelligence miss Hamas’ preparations to attack?

"Fifty years ago, a secret deal among Arab governments triggered one of the most traumatic economic crises to afflict the United States and other big oil importers.
Saudi King Faisal and other Arab leaders launched an oil embargo on Oct. 17, 1973, as payback for Washington siding with Israel in its war with neighboring Egypt and Syria.
The oil market hostilities arose from a pact between Faisal and the leaders of Egypt and Syria, whose armies planned surprise drives to retake their territory under Israeli occupation. If the United States intervened to assist Israel, Faisal and other Arab producers agreed to retaliate with the “oil weapon.”
When Washington airlifted in U.S. weapons that helped Israel thwart Arab gains, Faisal and OPEC’s Arab members retaliated. They increased oil prices, banned oil shipments to the United States and cut production by 5% per month.
The ensuing economic and political carnage is legendary. The embargo catalyzed a long period of upheaval in global oil markets and pain at the gasoline pump for Americans and consumers globally. Oil prices quadrupled nearly overnight and remained high for over a decade. Producing countries leveraged the opportunity to reclaim sovereignty over their oil reserves. By 1980, many had completed the process of kicking Western oil companies out of their territories.
Oil’s global regime change
The embargo’s disruptive power was due to two key factors: OPEC’s dominance of world oil supply, and oil’s supremacy in the global energy mix.
Prior to the embargo, oil fueled almost half of total energy consumption in the United States (47.5%) and worldwide (49%). While OPEC countries produced more than half (53%) of global oil, the concessions were operated by Western oil majors.
After the embargo, producer states took over. Control of global oil production passed from Western oil giants like Shell and Exxon to newly formed national oil companies.

As a result, a torrent of cash from oil sales poured into Middle Eastern countries where rudimentary services like electricity were still being built out. Oil revenues in Saudi Arabia jumped fortyfold between 1965 and 1975, from US$655 million to $26.7 billion. These countries also amassed new geopolitical power.
How the oil price spike played out in the West
In the West, price increases wreaked havoc on economies and transport systems that were far less efficient than today. Inflation soon boiled over into “stagflation,” a combination of economic stagnation and high inflation. Misguided policies, including gasoline price controls and rationing, exacerbated shortages, creating long lines at service stations and emboldening gasoline thieves.
A look back at the 1970s oil crisis.
America saw a pell-mell downsizing of gas-guzzling vehicles and a simultaneous ramping up of imports of fuel-efficient Japanese cars. Drivers obsessed over miles per gallon, and the U.S. government imposed corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards, aimed at saving fuel by requiring automakers to sell more fuel-efficient cars.
Western oil companies, kicked out of the Middle East and other oil regions, pivoted to more difficult terrain: the offshore Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, and the Arctic regions of northern Alaska.

As scholars of energy policy, we have long studied the embargo’s spillover effects on the global economy and political systems. These outcomes are a central theme in Jim Krane’s 2019 book “Energy Kingdoms.” On the embargo’s 50th anniversary, Oct. 17, 2023, King Faisal’s son, the former Saudi Ambassador to Washington Prince Turki Al Faisal, is joining us for a conference at Rice University’s Baker Institute to discuss the still-valid lessons of the Arab oil embargo.
50 years later, new pressures
Fifty years on, markets have changed. But oil continues to be the world’s dominant energy source.
On one hand, crude oil use has grown dramatically. Global supply has risen from less than 60 million barrels per day in 1973 to nearly 94 million barrels per day in 2022. Motor fuel prices are still a critical input to inflation; we calculate that the increase in gasoline prices in 2022 cost the average American household roughly $1,000.
On the other hand, OPEC’s importance – and oil’s share of the global energy mix – has declined. OPEC’s 13 members account for just 36% of global oil production today. The high oil prices caused by the 1973 embargo created incentives for oil drillers to diversify toward new sources of oil and develop substitute fuels to replace oil.
Within 15 years of the embargo, production outside OPEC increased by a massive 14 million barrels per day. Oil from Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico helped stabilize U.S. production. Later, the shale revolution turned the United States into the world’s largest producer and a net exporter of oil, capping a 50-year quest.
The world has also become much more efficient, reducing the amount of oil needed to maintain the same activity. Global per-capita oil use per dollar of gross domestic product has fallen by a massive 60% since 1973, our calculations show.
But, as in 1973, energy security concerns are back at the top of national agendas.
Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine reprised the risks of energy “weaponization.” Europe, in particular, has been hurt by overdependence on Russian natural gas and has raced to shift its energy sources. The Israel-Hamas war that began on Oct. 8, 2023, has not yet ignited retaliatory responses from Arab governments, and the initial impact on oil has been minimal, but geopolitical effects from such a large event could still roil markets.
Energy security itself is also being altered. The transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar insulates consumers from most supply chain risks. Electric vehicles likewise protect owners from swinging oil prices. So, while crucial materials can still be manipulated by governments, shortages and price spikes mainly affect component manufacturers and their investors. If supplies are bottlenecked long enough, the energy transition could be delayed.

Like the embargo 50 years ago, today’s crises have rendered the future of energy massively uncertain. Changes in the global energy mix, especially the rapid growth of electric vehicles, could weaken the importance of oil and the cartel that oversees it.

"The focus on conflict in the Middle East has again returned to the Gaza Strip, with Israel’s defense minister ordering a “complete siege” of the Palestinian enclave.
The military operation, which involves extensive bombing of residences, follows a surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023, by Hamas militants who infiltrated Israel from Gaza and killed around 1,200 Israelis. In reprisal airstrikes, the Israel military has killed over 1,400 Gazans. And that figure could escalate in the coming days. Meanwhile, an order to cut off all food, electricity and water to Gaza will only worsen the plight of residents in what has been called the “world’s largest open-air prison.”
But how did Gaza become one of the most densely populated parts of the planet? And why is it the home to militant Palestinian action now? As a scholar of Palestinian history, I believe understanding the answers to those questions provides crucial historical context to the current violence.
A brief history of Gaza
The Gaza Strip is a narrow piece of land on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Roughly twice the size of Washington, D.C., it is wedged between Israel to its north and east and Egypt to its south.
An ancient trade and sea port, Gaza has long been part of the geographic region known as Palestine. By the early 20th century, it was mainly inhabited by Muslim and Christian Arabs who lived under Ottoman rule. When Britain took control of Palestine following World War I, intellectuals in Gaza joined the emergent Palestinian national movement.
During the 1948 war that established the state of Israel, the Israeli military bombed 29 villages in southern Palestine, leading tens of thousands of villagers to flee to the Gaza Strip, under the control of the Egyptian army that were deployed after Israel declared independence. Most of them and their descendants remain there today.
Following the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Gaza Strip came under Israeli military occupation. The occupation has resulted in “systematic human rights violations,” according to rights group Amnesty International, including forcing people off their land, destroying homes and crushing even nonviolent forms of political dissent.
Palestinians staged two major uprisings, in 1987-1991 and in 2000-2005, hoping to end the occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state.
Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist militant group centered in Gaza, was founded in 1988 to fight against the Israeli occupation. Hamas and other militant groups launched repeated attacks on Israeli targets in Gaza, leading to Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. In 2006, Palestinian legislative elections were held. Hamas beat its secular rival, Fatah, which had been widely accused of corruption. Elections haven’t been held in Gaza since 2006, but polling from March 2023 found that 45% of Gazans would back Hamas should there be a vote, ahead of Fatah at 32%.
After a brief conflict between Hamas and Fatah militants in May 2007, Hamas took complete control of the Gaza Strip. Since then, Gaza has been under the administrative control of Hamas, even though it is still considered to be under Israeli occupation by the United Nations, the U.S. State Department and other international bodies.
Who are the Palestinians of Gaza?
The more than 2 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are part of the 14 million-strong global Palestinian community. About one third of Gaza’s inhabitants trace their family’s roots to land inside the Gaza Strip. The remaining two-thirds are refugees from the 1948 war and their descendants, many of whom hail from towns and villages surrounding Gaza.

The Palestinians of Gaza trend young: nearly half the population is under 18. The enclave is also very poor, with a poverty rate that stands at 53%.
Despite this grim economic picture, education levels are quite high. Over 95% of Gazan children ages 6-12 are in school. The majority of Palestinian students in Gaza graduate from high school, and 57% of students at the prestigious Islamic University of Gaza are female.
But because of the circumstances of their surroundings, young Palestinians in Gaza find it difficult to live fulfilling lives. For graduates between the ages of 19 and 29, the unemployment rate stands at 70%. And a World Bank survey earlier this year found 71% of Gazans show signs of depression and high levels of PTSD.
There are several factors that contribute to these conditions. A major factor is the crippling, 16-year blockade that Israel and Egypt – with U.S. support – have imposed on Gaza.
Years of blockade
Shortly after the 2006 elections, the Bush administration tried to force Hamas from power and bring in a rival leader from the Fatah party who was considered friendlier to Israel and the U.S. Hamas preempted the coup and took full control of Gaza in May 2007. In response, Israel and Egypt – with U.S. and European support – closed the border crossings into and out of the Gaza Strip and imposed a land, air and sea blockade.
The blockade, which is still in effect, limits the import of food, fuel and construction material; limits how far Gaza’s fishermen can go out to sea; bans almost all exports; and imposes strict limitations on the movement of people into and out of Gaza. In 2023, Israel has allowed only around 50,000 people a month to exit Gaza, according to U.N. figures.
The years of closure have devastated the lives of Palestinians in Gaza. Inhabitants there don’t have enough water for drinking and sanitation. They face electricity cuts that run 12 to 18 hours each day. Without adequate water and electricity, Gaza’s fragile health care system is “on the brink of collapse,” according to the medical rights group Medical Aid for Palestine.
These restrictions hit the young and the weak of Gaza particularly hard. Israel routinely denies sick patients the permits they need to receive medical care outside of Gaza. Bright students with scholarships to study abroad often find that they are unable to leave.
U.N. experts say this blockade is illegal under international law. They argue that the blockade amounts to a collective punishment of the Palestinians of Gaza, a violation of the Hague Convention and the Geneva Conventions that form the backbone of international law.
No end to the suffering
Israel says that the blockade on Gaza is necessary to secure the safety of its population and will be lifted when Hamas renounces violence, recognizes Israel and abides by previous agreements.
But Hamas has consistently rejected this ultimatum. Instead, militant fighters stepped up the firing of homemade rockets and mortars into populated areas surrounding the Gaza Strip in 2008, seeking to pressure Israel to lift the blockade. They have sporadically attacked Israel in this way in the years since.

Israel has launched four major military assaults on Gaza – in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021 – in efforts to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities. Those wars killed 4,000 Palestinians, more than half of whom were civilians, along with 106 people in Israel.
During that time, the U.N. estimates that there has been more than $5 billion worth of damage to Gaza’s homes, agriculture, industry, electricity and water infrastructure.
Each of those wars ended in a fragile cease-fire but no real resolution to the conflict. Israel seeks to deter Hamas from launching rockets. Hamas and other militant groups say that even when they have upheld previous cease-fires, Israel has continued to attack Palestinians and has refused to lift the blockade.
Hamas has offered a long-term truce in exchange for Israel ending the blockade on Gaza. Israel has refused to accept the offer, sticking to its position that Hamas must first end violence and recognize Israel.
In the months leading up to the latest escalation, conditions in Gaza have deteriorated even further. The International Monetary Fund reported in September that Gaza’s economic outlook “remains dire.” Conditions became more dire when Israel announced on Sept. 5, 2023, that it was halting all exports from a key Gaza border crossing.
Without an end in sight to the suffering caused by the blockade, it appears that Hamas has decided to upend the status quo in a surprise attack on Israelis, including civilians. Israel’s reprisal airstrikes and its imposition of a “complete siege” on the strip have heaped even further suffering on ordinary Gazans.
It is a tragic reminder that civilians bear the brunt of this conflict.

"Antiviral drugs are generally considered to be a 20th century invention. But recent research has uncovered an unexpected facet to your immune system: It can synthesize its own antiviral molecules in response to viral infections.
My laboratory studies a protein that makes these natural antiviral molecules. Far from a modern human invention, nature evolved cells to make their own “drugs” as the earliest defense against viruses.
How antivirals work
Viruses have no independent life cycle – they are completely dependent on the cells they infect to supply all the chemical building blocks needed to replicate themselves. Once inside a cell, the virus hijacks its machinery and turns it into a factory to make hundreds of new viruses.
Antiviral drugs are molecules that inactivate proteins essential to the functioning of the virus by exploiting the fundamental differences in the way that cells and viruses replicate.
One key difference between cells and most viruses is how they store their genetic information. All cells use DNA to store their genetic information. DNA is a long, chainlike molecule built from four different chemical building blocks, each representing a different “letter” of the genetic code. These building blocks are connected by chemical bonds in a head-to-tail fashion to produce strings of millions of letters. The order of these letters spells out the genetic blueprint for building a new cell.
Many viruses, however, store their genetic information using RNA. RNA is built from a chain of four chemical letters, just like DNA, but the letters have slightly different molecular structures. RNA is single-stranded, while DNA is double-stranded. Viral genomes are also much smaller than cellular genomes, typically only a few thousand letters long.
This diagram shows how four different classes of antiviral drugs inhibit HIV. One stops viruses from entering cells, and three inhibit different viral enzymes. Thomas Splettstoesser/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA
When a virus replicates, it makes many copies of its RNA genome using a protein called RNA polymerase. The polymerase starts at one end of the existing RNA chain and “reads” the string of chemical letters one at a time, selecting the appropriate building block and adding it to the growing strand of RNA. This process is repeated until the entire sequence of letters has been copied to form a new RNA chain.
One class of antiviral drugs interferes with the RNA copying process in a cunning way. The head-to-tail construction of the RNA chain requires each chemical letter to have two connection points – a head to connect to the previous letter and a tail to allow the following letter to be added on. These antivirals mimic one of the chemical letters but crucially lack the tail connection point. If the RNA polymerase mistakes the drug for the intended chemical letter and adds it to the growing RNA chain, the copying process stops because there is nothing to attach the next letter to. For this reason, this type of antiviral drug is called a chain-terminating inhibitor.
Viperin as antiviral producer
Previously, researchers thought that chain-terminating antiviral drugs were strictly a product of human ingenuity, developed from advances in scientific understanding of viral replication. However, the discovery that a protein in your cells named viperin synthesizes a natural chain-terminating antiviral has revealed a new side of your immune system.
Viperin works by chemically removing the tail connection point from one of the four RNA building blocks of a virus’s genome. This converts the building block into a chain-terminating antiviral drug.
This strategy has proved to be highly effective for treating viral infections. For example, the COVID-19 antiviral remdesivir works in this way. A viral RNA polymerase has to join together many thousands of letters to copy a virus’s genome, but an antiviral drug has to fool it only once to derail its copying. An incomplete genome lacks the necessary instructions to make a new virus and becomes useless.

Moreover, although cells also have their own polymerases, they never replicate RNA like viruses do. This potentially allows chain-terminating antiviral drugs to selectively inhibit viral replication, reducing unwanted side effects.
Clearly, viperin does not fully protect against all RNA viruses – otherwise no RNA viruses would make you sick. It seems that some viral RNA polymerases, such as those in poliovirus, have evolved to discriminate against the antiviral molecules that viperin synthesizes and blunt their effect. However, viperin is only one arm of your immune system, which includes specialized cells and proteins that protect you from infection in other ways.
Ancient antivirals
Scientists discovered viperin about 20 years ago while searching for genes that turn on in response to viral infections. However, figuring out what viperin actually does proved very challenging.
Viperin’s function was particularly puzzling because it resembles an ancient group of proteins called radical SAM enzymes that are usually found in bacteria and molds. Notably, radical SAM enzymes are extremely rare in animals. Exposure to air rapidly inactivates them, and researchers thought they likely didn’t work in people. It’s still unclear how viperin avoids inactivation.

Researchers were clued in to viperin’s function when they noticed that the gene coding for viperin is next to a gene involved in synthesizing one of RNA’s building blocks. This observation led them to examine whether viperin might modify this RNA building block.
Following this discovery, researchers identified viperinlike proteins across all kingdoms of life, from ancient bacteria to modern plants and animals. This meant that viperin is a very ancient protein that evolved early in life, probably well before the advent of multicellular organisms – because even bacteria must fight viral infections.
As more complex life forms evolved, viperin was retained and integrated into the complex immune systems of modern animals. Thus, this most recently discovered arm of your immune system’s defenses against viruses is likely the most ancient.",Your immune system makes its own antiviral drug − and it’s likely one of the most ancient,science + tech
"More than five months have passed since intense fighting broke out between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group also known as the RSF. In that time, more than 7,000 people have been killed and nearly 4 million others displaced. The conflict is still ongoing, with little evidence of resolution.
The clashes were sparked by a disagreement over how the RSF, led by Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, more commonly known as Hemedti, could be integrated into the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, led by Gen. Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan.
Sudan is the third-largest country by area in Africa. It is also home to the Nile River basin, is mineral rich and is strategically located on the Red Sea, close to the Middle East. So this conflict comes with heavy security and economic ramifications for the region and beyond.
As a political science professor who studies civil conflicts, I know that stability in Sudan requires a concerted effort from the international community. So far, a variety of efforts have failed. However, I believe that applying a right mix of international measures at the right time can give Sudan a chance at peace.
Roots of conflict
Much like Somalia and the former Yugoslavia, Sudan is what is known as an “anocracy” – that is, a political regime in transition from autocracy to democracy.
Anocracies are prone to armed conflicts. Mainly due to the growth of paramilitaries and weak civilian control of the military, they face frequent coups and rebellions.
Sudan experienced a major armed conflict in the western region of Darfur from 2003 to 2020, during which former president Omar al-Bashir used RSF paramilitaries to violently suppress rebel groups.
However, as the RSF grew more powerful, attempts to integrate it into the Sudanese army failed. And in 2022, a power struggle between the two groups ensued.
The conflict has displaced millions of Sudanese in recent months, including over 40,000 refugees currently living at this camp in Metche, Chad. Abdulmonam Eassa/Getty Images
The limits of mediation
Turkey, Ethiopia, Egypt and Israel have all offered to mediate between the SAF and RSF in Sudan. So did the African Union, along with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an eight-country trade bloc in Africa. They proposed Kenya as the key mediator.
The SAF and RSF have not accepted any of these offers.
Efforts by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have yielded several ceasefires, including a 72-hour ceasefire from June 18-21, 2023, but no concrete agreements.
Successful mediation requires that the mediator has leverage to offer incentives to the warring parties, and also maintains impartiality between them.
When it comes to Sudan, no mediator has managed to offer terms acceptable to both warring parties. Furthermore, many of the potential mediators have supported one side or the other.
Kenya and the United Arab Emirates have been accused by the Sudanese army of supporting the RSF, which fought in Yemen and Libya alongside the UAE. Egypt, meanwhile, supports the SAF due to traditional ties with Sudanese generals.
And while the U.S. does not have an official position of support for either side, partly due to the atrocities committed by both warring parties, its Saudi partners in the Jeddah talks back the SAF. This may stem from their rivalry with the UAE.
But what doomed the Jeddah talks was not this perceived Saudi bias but the lack of political leverage. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia failed to provide clear and concrete terms that could be acceptable to both warring parties.

Sanctions fall short
U.S. sanctions have targeted specific entities or individuals that disrupt the democratic transition in Sudan.
On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury announced sanctions against four companies within the gold mining, vehicle and weapons industries that it accused of funding or arming the warring parties. Two of the companies were affiliated with the SAF, and two were linked to the RSF. Three months later, the department also sanctioned Hemedti, the RSF leader.
Usually, the United Nations coordinates sanctions with the U.S., and U.S. allies follow suit. However, this cascade of sanctions has yet to happen. The U.N. Sanctions Committee has not added any new sanctions on Sudan yet, while the European Union is working on a framework for such sanctions.
While current and future sanctions may hold, targets often find alternative sources of funding. Despite U.S. sanctions targeting Hemedti’s RSF reliance on the gold trade, Russia has stepped in to supply weapons and training to Sudan in exchange for gold to fund its war in Ukraine.
Peacekeeping efforts hold promise
International peacekeeping can be effective in conflict zones, particularly when the efforts are properly resourced. Peacekeeping missions in the Ivory Coast from 2004 to 2017 and in Croatia from 1996 to 1998 are often cited as success stories.
The United Nations-African Union Mission, or UNAMIS, was a peacekeeping mission in Darfur from 2007 to 2020 that used both police and troops to provide a buffer zone. The missions had only partial successes, mainly due to the lack of support from the al-Bashir government.
In 2020, after the UNAMIS ended, the U.N. Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan, or UNITAMS, was tasked to assist political transitions in Sudan. However, it lacked police or troops, and its potential efficacy is heavily disputed.
An integrated approach
Observers of Sudanese politics and experts of international relations have suggested many solutions to stabilize Sudan, prevent further atrocities and eventually resolve the conflict.
These include stopping Hemedti’s flow of money, sending peacekeepers with troops and police, involving the International Criminal Court to investigate atrocities, coordinating political dialogue between international actors and warring parties, and restraining outside influences – such as from the UAE or Russia – that weaken the effect of sanctions on Sudan.
One integrated solution is to combine peacekeeping and mediation. This would mean augmenting UNITAMS with police and troops from the U.N. Peacekeeping division, while forging a united diplomatic front on the international level.
A short-term action for this united front would be to employ the U.N. mediation team. With a roster of experienced international mediators, the mediation team can try to provide opportunities for political dialogue.
A long-term solution, and one suggested in the international Peace Treaty Initiative, is to institutionalize the mediation effort. Once a country accepts the proposed treaty, it can request mediation before or after conflict erupts. This process avoids the difficulty of getting to the mediation table in the first place, while guaranteeing a coordinated and concerted mediation process.
A window of opportunity
In April 2023, the warring parties rejected international mediation offers and failed to send delegates for internal mediation in Khartoum, Sudan’s capital. Until mid-August, neither side seems had seemed to have reached the stage of a “hurting stalemate” – which is sorely needed for parties to come to the negotiation table.
However, with the death on Aug. 23, 2023, of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner group in Russia, Hemedti has lost a key Russian ally. This leaves him more vulnerable to U.S. sanctions on the gold trade. In fact, this may have been what prompted him to suggest a peace proposal on Aug. 27.
As for Burhan of the SAF, he has tried to burnish his image by visiting Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and he gave a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 21. This occurred after the SAF had to move to Port Sudan from Khartoum, where the RSF took a stronghold.
Given the weakened positions of both the RSF and SAF, a mediation window may open soon.
Challenges ahead
Any effort, however, is not without challenges.
A sufficient supply of well-resourced peacekeeping personnel is not guaranteed in this age of retrenchment. UNAMID was a US$1 billion endeavor, while UNITAMS’ current budget is $34 million a year.
Forging a united international front is another challenge, given the various foreign alliances both warring parties have.
Other tools are limited, however. For example, sanctions will not affect Burhan that much, as the SAF still has air power and will be able to sustain its airstrikes.
Despite the challenges ahead, Sudan cannot be ignored. However, a lasting resolution requires multiple measures that can augment each other. The lack of external interference, plus an impartial mediator and U.S. leverage, will be essential ingredients for mediation to move forward. And the mix of measures must be applied with the right timing and with the right actors involved.",Peace in Sudan is elusive for any would-be mediators – but a new window of opportunity has opened for outside intervention,politics
"In many ways Hamas’s attack on Israel sums up the essence of terrorism. The group’s mass incursions have seen its operatives storming Israeli towns, killing and kidnapping hundreds. This appears to have been done by the book when it comes to creating feelings of terror and escalating the situation.
Yet it’s also a reminder, as pioneering terrorism scholar Martha Crenshaw teaches, that terrorism depends on the specific context of the situation from which it arises, and at the same time its implications often go well beyond national boundaries.
Among the many observations that could be made, three are worth flagging. First and foremost, terrorism is in its nature a highly developed form of psychological warfare. Number-wise, terrorism kills far fewer people than malaria, car accidents and cardiovascular diseases, but polls consistently show that many people remain highly concerned about terrorism.
Terrorism is built upon secrecy, deception and surprise. Whenever feasible, it should be spectacular, lethal and indiscriminate, because terrorism is like a stage for seeking media attention.
Striking on symbolic dates and flooding the web with graphic, bone-chilling videos (including fake ones) is vital for terrorists. It enables them to blow things out of proportion and bring people’s worst nightmares to life. In this sense, Hamas did it all.
Motivation and capability
Second, as prominent counter-terrorism researcher Boaz Ganor has argued, the likelihood of a terrorist attacks depends on the motivation and capabilities of terrorists.
In spite of the ceasefire agreed at the end of the 2014 Gaza war, Hamas clearly still has an uncompromising, partly religious motivation. Its violence is in line with its charter, which states: “Resistance and jihad for the liberation of Palestine will remain a legitimate right, a duty and an honour.”
But not only does Hamas have very strong motivation that justifies mass killing, it also has much capability, including weapons, funds, intelligence and diplomatic coverage, much of which comes from Iran. The group’s arsenal includes rockets, drones and small arms, but also less conventional ways to maximise casualties, such as bulldozers to tear down fences and paragliders to elude more technologically sophisticated defence systems.
In previous conflicts, Hamas has allegedly used tunnels, booby-traps and hundreds of people not necessarily affiliated with the group but still ready to fight to the death to create fatal resistance to Israeli troops. Israel should expect something similar if it invades Gaza again.
In this respect, it has the motivation to kill as many people as possible and the capabilities to fight a prolonged war, so its terrorist attacks are very likely to continue cyclically.
Provoking a reaction
Third, the attack reiterates terrorism’s lust for overreaction and escalation, especially in the face of waning domestic and international support for the group that commits it.
In a twisted way, Hamas arguably needs this escalation. In the past weeks, growing numbers of Gazan residents have reportedly been protesting the group’s leadership, accusing it of corruption and failing to improve living conditions. But most importantly, the growing possibility of an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia would be a tremendous blow to Hamas’s credibility within the Islamic world because it would directly contradict its anti-Israel position.
Now that it has successfully provoked Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing “mighty revenge”, Hamas can divert Palestinian attention away from its problems and score points in its competition with the rival Palestinian Authority (PA). If Israel attacks, Hamas will silence criticism coming from PA and others in the West Bank, who will never side with Israel, rallying the Palestinian population around its flag. The Israeli-Saudi deal is likely to collapse.

There is more. The seemingly upcoming war could spill over to southern Lebanon as Hezbollah (the terrorist group that controls the region) also wants escalation. Like Hamas, Hezbollah has been losing grip over various segments of Lebanese society due to allegations of corruption, intervention in the Syrian conflict, and tampering with the judicial investigation into the 2020 Beirut port blast.
Iran might also see war as a golden opportunity to weaken Israel and seriously compromise accords with Saudi Arabia, Tehran’s other key regional competitor.
Israel risks getting dragged in a bloody, prolonged conflict in which its troops have to go door-to-door looking for Hamas operatives. This would result in hundreds if not thousands of deaths and do exactly what Hamas and Hezbollah want by making them into Palestine’s only, real defenders in its people’s eyes.
Large-scale and sensationalised terrorist attacks often bear soul-searching questions. In the case of Israel and its allies, this will mean re-examining intelligence sharing and analysis capabilities.
But also, what are truly effective counterstrategies to this sort of terrorism, and what does victory really look like? As winning becomes an increasingly blurred concept, they may conclude that a military response is paramount. But no one is going to police or bomb their way out of this.

"There will be only one winner in the war that has broken out between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. And it is neither Israel nor Hamas.
In an operation coined “the Al-Aqsa Storm,” Hamas, whose formal name is the Islamic Resistance Movement, fired thousands of rockets into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters infiltrated Israel by land, sea and air. Hundreds of Israelis have been killed, more than 2,000 injured, and many taken hostage.
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on Hamas and launched airstrikes in Gaza. In the first day of reprisals, close to 400 Palestinians were killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
In the weeks ahead, the Israeli military will surely retaliate and kill hundreds more Palestinian militants and civilians. As an analyst of Middle East politics and security, I believe that thousands on both sides will suffer. But when the smoke settles, only one country’s interests will have been served: Iran’s.
Already, some analysts are suggesting that Tehran’s fingerprints can be seen on the surprise attack on Israel. At the very least, Iran’s leaders have reacted to the assault with encouragement and support.

The decisive factor shaping Iran’s foreign policy was the 1979 overthrow of the U.S.-friendly, repressive Shah of Iran and the transfer of state power into the hands of a Shiite Muslim revolutionary regime. That regime was defined by stark anti-American imperialism and anti-Israeli Zionism.
The revolution, its leaders claimed, was not just against the corrupt Iranian monarchy; it was intended to confront oppression and injustice everywhere, and especially those governments backed by the United States – chief among them, Israel.
For Iran’s leaders, Israel and the United States represented immorality, injustice and the greatest threat to Muslim society and Iranian security. The enduring hostility felt toward Israel is in no small part due to its close ties with the shah and Israel’s role in his sustained oppression of the Iranian people. Together with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, helped organize the shah’s secret police and intelligence service, the SAVAK. This organization relied on increasingly harsh tactics to put down dissenters during the shah’s last two decades in power, including mass imprisonment, torture, disappearances, forced exile and killing thousands of Iranians.
Support for Palestinian liberation was a central theme of Iran’s revolutionary message. The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon – in retaliation for Lebanon-based Palestinian attacks against Israel – provided Iran an opportunity to live up to its anti-Zionist rhetoric by challenging Israeli soldiers in Lebanon and checking U.S. influence in the region.
Subsidizing conflict
To that end, Iran sent its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – a branch of Iran’s military, usually known as the “Revolutionary Guard” – to Lebanon to organize and support Lebanese and Palestinian militants. In Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, Revolutionary Guardsmen instructed Shiite resistance fighters in religion, revolutionary ideology and guerrilla tactics, and provided weapons, funds, training and encouragement. Iran’s leadership transformed these early trainees from a ragtag band of fighters into Lebanon’s most powerful political and military force today, and Iran’s greatest foreign policy success, Hezbollah.
Since the early 1980s, Iran has maintained support for anti-Israeli militant groups and operations. The Islamic Republic has publicly pledged millions of dollars of annual support to groups and provides advanced military training for thousands of Palestinian fighters at Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah bases in Iran and Lebanon.
Iran runs a sophisticated smuggling network to funnel weapons into Gaza, which has long been cut off from the outside world by an Israeli blockade.
Via the Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah, Iran has encouraged and enabled Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas violence, and these Palestinian fighters now represent a crucial element in what foreign affairs analysts call Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” against Israel and the United States, which constitutes Iran’s chief purpose.
But Iran cannot risk confronting either state directly.
Iranian weapons, funds and training enable surges in Palestinian militant violence against Israel when frustrations boil over, including during the Palestinian uprisings known as the first and second intifadas.
Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and death tolls have escalated steadily since 2020. Palestinians are outraged by increased evictions and destruction of property, and how Israel allows Israeli nationalists and settlers to violate a long-standing agreement preventing Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque – a site holy to both Muslims and Jews. In fact, a recent incursion by settlers into Al-Aqsa was specifically cited by Hamas as a justification for the Oct. 7 attack.

That is not to say that Iran ordered Hamas’ attack on Israel, nor that Iran controls Palestinian militants – they are not Iranian puppets. Nevertheless, Iran’s leaders welcomed the attacks, the timing of which serendipitously works in Iran’s favor and plays into the Islamic republic’s regional battle for influence.
“What took place today is in line with the continuation of victories for the anti-Zionist resistance in different fields, including Syria, Lebanon and occupied lands,” according to Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani.
The week before the Hamas attack, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman denied reports that Saudi Arabia had paused its recent efforts to normalize relations with Israel, which includes a formal declaration of Israel’s right to exist and increased diplomatic engagement. “Every day we get closer,” he said, an assessment praised and echoed by Netanyahu.
Israeli-Saudi normalization would represent the pinnacle of achievement thus far in U.S. diplomatic efforts, including the Abraham Accords, signed by Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco in 2020. The accords aimed to normalize and build peaceful relations between Israel and Arab countries across the Middle East and in Africa.
Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei lambasted Arab states for signing the Abraham Accords, accusing them of “treason against the global Islamic community.”
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah praised Saturday’s violence against Israel and echoed Khamenei’s sentiments, warning that the attacks sent a message, “especially to those seeking normalization with this enemy.”
Israel’s expected heavy-handed response is likely to complicate Saudi Arabia’s normalization with Israel in the near term, furthering Iran’s aims. Netanyahu said that Israel’s retaliatory operation seeks three objectives: to eliminate the threat of infiltrators and restore peace to attacked Israeli communities, to simultaneously “exact an immense price from the enemy” in Gaza, and to reinforce “other fronts so that nobody should mistakenly join this war.” This last objective is a subtle but clear warning to Hezbollah and Iran to stay out of the fight.
Israeli troops have already mobilized to secure its borders, and airstrikes have hit Gaza. In all likelihood, Palestinian attackers will be killed or arrested in a matter of days. Israeli troops and air forces will target known or suspected rocket launch, manufacturing, storage and transportation sites, along with the homes of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members. But in the process, hundreds of civilians will likely also lose their lives.
I believe that Iran expects and welcomes all of this.
How Iran wins
There are at least three possible outcomes to the war, and they all play in Iran’s favor.
First, Israel’s heavy-handed response may turn off Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to U.S.-backed Israeli normalization efforts. Second, if Israel deems it necessary to push further into Gaza to eradicate the threat, this could provoke another Palestinian uprising in East Jerusalem or the West Bank, leading to a more widespread Israeli response and greater instability.
Lastly, Israel could achieve its first two objectives with the minimal amount of force necessary, foregoing usual heavy-handed tactics and reducing chances of escalation. But this is unlikely. And even if this occurred, the underlying causes that led to this latest outbreak of violence, and the enabling role Iran plays in that process, have not been addressed.
And when the next round of Israeli-Palestinian violence occurs – and it will – I believe Iran’s leaders will again congratulate themselves for a job well done.","The Israel-Hamas war: No matter who loses, Iran wins",politics
"For the past 16 years South Africans have dreaded rolling power cuts euphemistically dubbed “loadshedding”. These are caused by the ailing state power entity Eskom’s crumbling infrastructure and its over-reliance on ageing and poorly maintained coal-fired power stations. Loadshedding has worsened in 2023, with some areas experiencing power cuts for up to 10 hours a day.
This crisis affects every aspect of the country’s economy, including its vibrant tourism sector. Tourism is a vital contributor to the South African economy. In 2019 the country welcomed over 10 million foreign visitors. The sector contributed up to 6.4% of the gross domestic product along with 1.5 million jobs (9.3% of total jobs).
These figures have contracted significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visitors are returning. But the financial recovery and viability of the sector, which is composed mainly of small businesses, continues to be hampered by the electricity crisis.
If tourism businesses are to literally and figuratively keep the lights on they must transition towards renewable electricity generation. There are three reasons for this. First, providing consistent electricity to their guests is essential for any tourism business. Second, renewable energy is less damaging to the environment than coal-based generation and its greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, customers are increasingly aware of environmental concerns. Many demand more sustainable tourism products and adjust their travel choices accordingly.
We are a team of interdisciplinary researchers with interests in tourism, sustainability and the environment who recently collaborated on a research paper that studied South Africa’s potential to break away from old forms of energy generation towards low carbon electricity generation. There are already some positive moves in this direction. But much more remains to be done. This will require the tourism industry and other economic sectors to step up.
What’s already being done
Some work is already being done to enhance the tourism sector’s environmental sustainability. The government’s Tourism Environmental Implementation Plan, published in 2021, facilitates greater participation by tourism establishments in renewable electricity generation and saving.
Read more: South Africa's power crisis will continue until 2025 - and blackouts will take 5 years to phase out
One initiative included in the plan is the tourism department’s Green Tourism Incentive Programme. It supports small tourism businesses by providing free energy and water audits. These can lead to improved efficiencies and the introduction of subsidised renewable energy systems. So far, 111 renewable energy projects have been funded. The Green Tourism Incentive Programme pays approximately two-thirds of investments. Individual businesses finance the remaining third.
In the private sector, the City Lodge hotel group shows what can be achieved by installing renewable energy systems. In 2020, solar panels generated just over 10% of the electricity requirements of the group’s 59 hotels.
Nature-based tourism is one of the mainstays of South African tourism products. South African National Parks, the body that manages national parks, has installed solar PV panels at 19 of its 21 parks. It is also putting in place other low-carbon strategies as well as climate adaptation plans.

Getting it done
While these examples are encouraging, they remain limited in size and scope. Most innovation in South Africa towards sustainable energy generation has been self-funded as a business survival strategy to deal with the consequences of power cuts. The shift to renewable electricity, along with its greenhouse gas and air pollution benefits, is a happy coincidence.
A broader transition, helped by access to finance on terms that can smooth its way, is necessary to bring about a system change for tourism. This can place the sector on a path that decouples it from coal-based electricity. It will also ensure that small businesses can adopt renewable electricity.
The green energy shift in tourism is already taking place in developed economies in Europe. Turkey is another encouraging example. It has introduced a sustainable tourism programme; solar PV panels are used widely by businesses and households alike.
Through shifting the tourism sector to renewable energy, tourism in South Africa can be part of the just transition too. This transition must include small and community-based tourism players. And, while tourism must play its part, other economic sectors should also step up.
Supportive South African policies are indispensable in developing an enabling environment for sustainability transitions. The state and its institutions must take greater responsibility and accountability to advance the social sustainability of energy policies. One way this could happen is by making the Green Tourism Incentive Programme more accessible to tourism enterprises across the country.

"101 Curious Tales of East African Birds is a new book that uses academic research to tell fascinating stories about the tropical birds of east Africa, from well-known species to rare ones. It also explores changing bird behaviour in the region. Its author, Colin Beale, studies shifts in the distribution of birds and other animals. We asked him four questions.
Why is it important to study birds and their environment?
Like millions of people around the world, I love watching birds. They’re so accessible, and their busy lives brighten up pretty much anywhere from a city centre to remote wilderness landscapes. And the more I watch them, the more curious I get about their lives and the adaptations that help them survive.
It is easy to see this as pure indulgence, the study of ornithology as a pastime of the rich in a time when most of the world still struggles with basic needs. But I see birds and birdwatching as a gateway drug to ecology, and ecology is the science that can help us tackle the biodiversity crisis that threatens life on Earth today.
Read more: Why a proper record of birds in Africa is so important -- for Europe
Hearing that the rufous-tailed weaver had expanded its distribution from Tanzania into Kenya set me on a path that led first to identify much wider distribution changes in east African birds, then to link this to changing rainfall patterns.
Next, I took a leap into research projects seeking to understand how fire affects bird diversity and may help mitigate changes in grassland quality. Ultimately I was working with pastoralist communities of northern Tanzania to restore rangelands degraded by climate change and inappropriate grazing regimes.
Studying birds is not only good for your own mental and physical health, but can lead to valuable action on environmental challenges.
What sets east Africa’s birds apart?
The combination of extraordinary diversity, stunning colours and relatively high visibility makes the birds of east Africa a particular delight. With about 1,500 species in the region (more than 1,000 in Tanzania alone) the diversity is nearly overwhelming. Sit and watch a single bunch of flowering bushes and you could easily see five or six exquisitely plumaged sunbird species come and feed on them.
While several South American regions have slightly higher diversity than east Africa, the visibility in East African savannahs makes birding so rewarding. The birds also have an incredible variety of lifestyles, with certain behaviours such as social breeding much more common in drier tropical areas than elsewhere. I’m always finding new ways for birds to make a living.
An additional part of my fascination is the relative lack of research on east African birds. While a few species have been very well studied, there are still many species for which we don’t know the answers to basic questions, such as where and when they nest.
What are the most intriguing bird stories you have recorded?
The stories I enjoy sharing the most are the ones that either illustrate a piece of ecology that surprises, or describe an extreme evolutionary oddity.
For example, I love sharing how Temminck’s coursers, a beautiful cream and apricot ground bird with smart black and white highlights, are adapted to burnt landscapes. So many people consider wildfires destructive and bad. For many visitors to east Africa’s protected areas, discovering that rangers deliberately set fires is shocking. But these are ecosystems that have co-evolved with hominids, and our ancestors have been setting fires in savannahs for longer than almost all the species have existed.
Fire-dependent species like Temminck’s courser arrive while fires are still burning, set up territories and nest on bare, burnt earth. Their eggs and chicks are blackish to maximise camouflage, fully reliant on this human-derived landscape. This is testament to our ongoing role in maintaining savannahs.

Consider too the evolutionary processes that led to ostrich males fighting over and stealing each other’s chicks. This apparently strange behaviour makes perfect sense when you realise that feeding more chicks costs ostriches nothing as they feed themselves, but surrounding your own brood with a larger flock of tasty chicks means that hungry predators are less likely to eat your offspring. The more we know about birds, the more questions we uncover.
Why do your findings matter, and for whom?
My original aim in collating these stories was to share some of the fascination and joy that I take from learning about east African birds and to bring them in an accessible way to a wider audience. I originally started researching these stories to provide safari guides with more information to share with their clients when they’re bored with yet another sleeping lion, but it soon became clear the audience was wider.
I passionately believe that the more someone knows about birds the more they enjoy them and, hopefully, the more likely they are to take actions that protect them and the environments they depend upon.

I don’t think the science I describe is always of particular importance, but hopefully the curious tales that are collected inspire more people to take notice of the birds around them. There is no doubt in my mind that we need more people who care, or the biodiversity crisis that the world is facing will continue unabated. If you like wildlife, if you like birds or even if you just want to spend some time thinking about something other than the news, I hope you might enjoy this collection of scientific tales and perhaps be galvanised to take some action to protect the natural world we all depend upon.

"Across the world, women and men experience the impacts of the climate crisis in different ways. These are shaped by societal roles and responsibilities and result in widening inequalities between men and women.
Sea-level rise, storm surges and high waves in coastal area do not discriminate, but societal structures often do. This makes climate change a highly gender-sensitive issue.
Research has long shown that coastal areas are the most directly affected by climate change. Small islands in Asia, central and South America and Africa – what many term “the global south” – are particularly vulnerable to land erosion and economic decline, amid livelihood losses in fisheries.
My doctoral research explores how in countries where women and girls already face disproportionate inequalities relating to ethnicity, class, age and education, the climate crisis is making things worse. In coastal areas, in particular, women and girls are ever more vulnerable.

Livelihoods under threat
In 2017, in collaboration with the Indonesian Feminist Journal, I conducted research off the coast of Demak in Java, Indonesia. I found that women in coastal communities faced multiple problems, from poverty and domestic and gender-based violence to employment challenges.
Fisherwomen who work at sea are having to sail further out and contend with difficult conditions to find catches. One woman, Zarokah, I interviewed had started fishing with her husband, two years earlier, when he could no longer find a crew to work with. They wake at 3am to head out to sea.
She told me a basket of tiny flying fish goes for 150,000 rupiah (£7.70) and a good haul will yield several baskets. But even when they don’t catch anything, they still have to cover the cost of supplies and equipment. This income is inadequate when faced with a situation where fish are becoming scarcer and extreme weather prevents them from going out to sea.
I have shown how women in this area and beyond have contributed significantly to the fishing sector and coastal economies. And yet, Masnu'ah, who is the founder of a local fisherwomen’s organisation, told me that women’s economic role continues to not be recognised by their male peers and society more broadly.
Zarokah is still labelled a “housewife” on her ID card, despite the fact that, as she put it, “If I don’t go, my husband doesn’t go either and we cannot meet our needs.”
If the fisherwomen do not receive recognition for their work, they are unable to access social protections including life insurance. As climate change increasingly threatens the profession at large, having state support and insurance is vital.
Access to amenities and healthcare
It’s not just women’s livelihoods in this area that are impacted by extreme weather and any other disruptions to the fishing industry. Tidal flooding has also made it difficult for women and girls to access healthcare facilities.
Women find it difficult to access clinics because the roads are closed and isolated. One activist in Demak told me about helping a woman give birth in the middle of a tidal flood – when the houses were sinking. “It was very difficult,” she said, “because the waves were high, there were no boats. The baby died two to three days after.”
Research from other regions in the world show a similar pattern of increasing vulnerability. In the south-western coastal region of Bangladesh, natural hazards, including storm surges and cyclones, have long affected women significantly. Of the 140,000 people killed in the 1991 cyclone disaster, 90% were women.

However, the impacts are broader than that. A recent study looked at women’s lives, particularly among the ethnic Munda community, in the Khulna, Satkhira and Bagerhat districts. It found that bad management of open-water sources (ponds and canals) has led to high water salinity. Women and girls, who are responsible for family provisions, have to walk up to 3km – and sometimes as far as 5km – to find drinking water.
They spend long hours carrying heavy water pots, which leads to chronic pain conditions. During droughts, this task can take over three hours daily. The women and girls also face harassment from boys and men while collecting the water.
A 2020 study in Ilaje, a coastal region in Nigeria, found that, there too, women and girls often bear the responsibility of ensuring there’s enough food, fuel and clean water available at home. During times of low rainfall or drought, they have to cover similarly long distances. Young girls sometimes have to leave school in order to help their mothers with these tasks.
Pregnant women in Ilaje, particularly, are vulnerable to health effects like malnutrition, dehydration, anemia, and other health risks related to low food and water availability during crises.
Due to prevailing patriarchal norms, Ilaje women lack the authority to make independent decisions within their families and in society. They don’t have control over financial matters and assets. And they are not given opportunities to participate in public spaces, in particular within community group discussions on climate change adaptation. As a result, they are unable to voice their specific concerns and needs – at both family and community levels.

Oceans and coastal ecosystems cover over two thirds of the planet. They play a crucial role in food and energy production as well as creating employment opportunities. About 600 million people – around 10% of the world’s population – reside in coastal areas that are less than 10 metres above sea level.
The central tenet of the UN’s 2030 agenda for sustainable development is to “leave no one behind”. Applying a feminist political lens to the climate crisis is crucial to understanding how multilayered the problems facing women and girls in rural and coastal regions around the world are.
Yet, social and feminist research on how the climate is changing has been scarce. Without it, women and girls will indeed be left behind.

"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital city, will likely face increased heatwaves, droughts and severe flooding over the next 67 years. These changes will pose risks to public health and infrastructure. They’ll also be felt most acutely by the city’s most vulnerable residents: those living in informal settlements.
Addis Ababa is one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa, and its current metropolitan population of about 5.4 million is projected to reach close to 9 million by 2035.
This increase in the city’s population will be absorbed by informal settlements, the prime destination for most migrants. And informal settlements are characterised by poor or non-existent infrastructure, and face the twin challenges of worsening climate change and poor urban environmental policy.
To investigate the city’s vulnerability to climate change, researchers at Tufts University and the Woodwell Climate Research Center analysed flood risk and temperature data for different time periods, projecting from the past to the future.
We predicted that the city’s extreme daily maximum temperatures would increase by about 1.7°C over the period 2040-2060, compared with 2000–2020. An increase of 1.7°C would result in a rise in the frequency, duration, and intensity of heatwaves. In addition, higher temperatures contribute to increased water vapour and transpiration. This will threaten health, ecosystems, infrastructure, livelihoods, and food supplies.
Certain southern neighbourhoods, such as Akaki-Kaliti, Bole and Nifas Silk-Lafto, have experienced notably higher temperatures, especially during the warm season from March to May. And, looking to the future, temperature projections for Nifas Silk-Lafto suggest an average temperature increase to 26.21°C between 2040 and 2060, and further increase to 27.78°C from 2070 to 2090 and 27.78°C from 2070 to 2090.
Figure 1. Daily maximum temperature distributions for Addis. (a) Annual. (b) March, April, and May (warmest season) of Addis Ababa. Yimere, Author provided (no reuse)
For the warm-season months of March, April, and May, a temperature increase of 1.8°C is projected. This suggests that the peak temperature for the hottest day of the year will rise by an average of 1.8°C compared to recent data. From 2000 to 2020 the average temperature in the Nifas Silk-Lafto sub-city was 24.70°C.
Increases in temperatures of this magnitude will lead to public health challenges such as increased malaria risks, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, and women.
More droughts
Over the past two decades, Addis Ababa has endured an average of three months of extreme drought yearly. Using the Palmer Drought Severity Index to assess temperature and precipitation data in a geographical area, our analysis suggests that extreme drought events will become more frequent between 2040 and 2060. The city is expected to experience an additional 1.6 months of extreme drought annually, a 53% increase compared with 2000-2020.
This rising frequency of droughts, along with the city’s growing population, is intensifying water insecurity. Groundwater reserves for drought emergencies are already being depleted.
These droughts will affect health, hydroelectric energy production and urban agriculture.
Flooding
Too much rainfall, particularly if it occurs within a short period of time in an urban area, leads to flooding. Flooding poses a significant environmental risk to Addis Ababa, especially because the city has developed around three primary rivers.
Climate change will increase water-related challenges by affecting the flow of rivers and the replenishment of groundwater.
Currently, 67% of the population in Addis lives in flood prone areas. The parts of the city that are most at risk include central Addis, which has the greatest density of impervious surfaces like tarmac and concrete. These contribute to flood risk because water can’t seep into the ground.
Other parts of the city that are at risk include the southern half – where the slope is relatively flatter, so water doesn’t flow away – and the Nifas Silk-Lafto region, where considerable development has taken place in the floodplain.
Several factors will add to the flooding challenge. The city has inadequate sewerage infrastructure and weak drainage systems which are often obstructed by solid waste.
The impact
The effects on the city’s residents will be substantial.
Health is just one example.
Our data show that average temperatures in the city will make year-round malaria transmission a risk. There will have to be sustained policy measures to deal with the risk.
Figure 2. Observed malaria incidence rate in Addis Ababa. Yimere, Author provided (no reuse)
Older adults and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. The elderly are more sensitive to heat and pollution due to existing health conditions, limited mobility, and compromised immune systems. Pregnant women face risks from thermal variations and mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria and Zika.

Many urban residents will be prone to increasing floods. Already 10% of the city’s newly developed areas are within a 100-year floodplain, threatening lives and infrastructures.
People living in informal settlements are particularly at risk – that’s about 70% of Addis Ababa’s residents. These settlements crop up in limited and unused spaces, such as riverbanks. They are at a higher risk of flood impact, and the risk is growing.
Our data shows that currently the percentage difference in vulnerability between formal and informal settlements is 0.6%. The figure illustrates the extent to which buildings within formal and informal settlements would be affected by flooding events. It is expected to rise to 1.3% by 2050 and 1.6% by 2080.
Policy recommendations
There’s an urgent need for policies that can rise to these challenges. We suggest:
the government should establish a climate adaptation and resilience office, to integrate climate resilience into urban planning
an independent body should then assess policies in practice
a water management strategy to ensure equitable access and sustainable use of water
the city should invest in green infrastructure

"Climate risks can be complex to deal with because they don’t respect country borders. Hazards in one region can have negative repercussions in another. These are known as transboundary climate risks, and they’re a growing concern. They require coordinated, multinational responses, which can be a challenge given the different priorities and capabilities of each country.
A transboundary climate risk could be due to a shared ecosystem, such as a river basin. For instance the Nile river, which flows through 11 countries, can experience variations in water availability due to changes in the weather. This will affect the millions who depend on it.
Transboundary climate risks can also cross continents and oceans and spawn crises on the other side of the world. These could range from food and water shortages to threats to trade and energy, widening inequalities, forced migrations and even geopolitical conflicts.
For instance a drought in East Africa could affect tea production in Kenya. This would lead to an increase in prices for tea drinkers in importing countries, like the UK. Likewise, a typhoon could affect manufacturers in south-east Asia. This could disrupt the supply of electronics to African markets and lead to price hikes or shortages.
Africa is particularly vulnerable. Trade routes, supply chains and shared ecosystems span across the continent. A climate-induced disruption in one country can easily ripple into cascading effects in its neighbours. The coordinated management of transboundary climate risks is both a challenge and a necessity.
At the recent Africa climate summit in Kenya, the African Union and other African stakeholders presented the Roadmap for African Resilience to address this.
The roadmap contains a series of actions meant to enhance coordination between the regional economic communities and member states in addressing and managing transboundary and cascading climate risks. This is an objective of the African Union’s Climate Change and Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan 2022–2032.
Historically, adaptation efforts have largely addressed localised impacts, such as rising sea levels and coastal communities or frequent droughts and their impact on agricultural yields.
As an expert on adaptation to climate change, I believe that the significance of this roadmap lies in its comprehensive, continent-wide approach. It recognises that shared challenges require shared solutions. And it underscores Africa’s commitment to taking charge of its climate destiny. This makes the roadmap valuable in the evolving discourse on global climate resilience.
Unified front
The Roadmap for African Resilience outlines 25 crucial actions to fortify Africa’s resilience against transboundary climate risks. It has a focus on the risks posed to global supply chains, energy and food markets.
The roadmap’s actions can be grouped into four general plans:
Recognise the risks: this includes a pan-African transboundary climate risk assessment and the development of risk indicators.
Govern together: identify the transboundary risks that each country considers most important. These will be included in different areas of policy.
Implement Africa-wide adaptation: create a plan to find the best ways to strengthen communities against transboundary climate risks. Just resilience principles are embedded into this, such as prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable people and upholding human rights and cultural values. The roadmap also kickstarts a programme to put these ideas into action.
Mobilise resources for resilience: getting more money from multiple countries to support climate action, making sure private investments match public goals by emphasising systemic resilience, and building capacity to invest together.
The Roadmap for African Resilience thus offers a holistic, pan-African vision. It not only identifies transboundary climate risks but also proposes a structured approach for collective action.
Implementing the roadmap requires the active involvement of a range of African organisations. These include the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union Commission, the African Union Development Agency – New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the African Group of Negotiators Expert Support and the Regional Economic Communities in Africa. In addition, national governments, the private sector, civil society and academia play crucial roles.
The challenge will lie in ensuring cohesive action among these entities. Especially when adaptation to climate risks is a relatively new endeavour for some of the above organisations.
Significant step
The inaugural Africa Climate Summit marked a significant step for Africa’s collective commitment to resilience. The roadmap acknowledges the reality of Africa’s intertwined destinies and the need for collaborative solutions to cross-border climate risks.
Given the borderless nature of climate risks, global cooperation must be at the heart of adaptation initiatives.

"Following two decades of fierce negotiations, over 60 countries recently signed a UN Ocean Treaty to conserve biodiversity on the high seas.
The “high seas” are all ocean areas which aren’t under a specific country’s direct ownership or regulation. They make up two-thirds of Earth’s oceans, providing 90% of the habitat available for life.
The treaty has been celebrated as historic. It’s the first time that action will be taken against unregulated use of resources in this ungoverned space.
It’s estimated that 90% of the world’s marine fish stocks are now fully exploited, overexploited or depleted. Although less than 10% of the total global fish catch is from the high seas, the unregulated nature of fishing there has a harmful impact on marine life.
The treaty consists of 76 articles. Their goals include the protection and sustainable management of the marine environment, preserving the integrity of ocean ecosystems – such as coral reefs – and conserving biological diversity. Once ratified, the treaty will allow the establishment of marine protected areas in the high seas.
Though it doesn’t explicitly prohibit commercial fishing in the high seas, it includes language that may allow for their “sustainable use”. So, the establishment of a protected area in the high seas is expected to address unsustainable fishing activities in the space, but only if fully implemented.

Part of my expertise lies in maritime and natural resource governance in Africa, so I’ve been following this development. There are reasons to celebrate the Oceans Treaty for what it represents – an extra mechanism to protect our oceans and their resources. But my main concern – which has also been flagged by others – is that the treaty could drive distant water fleets (fishing outside their own territory) to fishing grounds closer to land. And many of the most lucrative grounds belong to African countries.
The treaty has been described as “extremely broad” and lacking specifics. Clear regulations must be put in place by the treaty’s implementing agency. It’s not yet clear who that will be. The treaty calls for state parties to allow for the establishment of various committees and working groups, together with a Conference of the Parties to guide implementation.
I argue that clear regulations must ensure that fisheries subsidies to vessels that once relied on the high seas must be cut. Subsidies given to distant water vessels can encourage the overexploitation of vulnerable species.
Attractive fishing grounds
Having lost access to fish on the high seas, fleets will need new fishing grounds. African waters are an attractive target for various reasons.
Firstly, they’re rich in diverse species.
Secondly, these waters are not properly monitored, which means countries can take advantage of them. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing already costs Africa over US$2.3 billion annually.
Thirdly, coastal African states appear willing to enter into new agreements with nations that fish outside their own borders.
This is worrying because it’s going to put Africa’s vulnerable fish stocks at risk. Distant-water vessels are already known to be exploitative.
Who are these vessels?
About 97% of high-seas fishing is done by vessels flagged to high-income countries – the vast majority (86%) are from China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Spain.
Vessels from some of these countries, such as China, South Korea and Spain, already have fisheries arrangements with countries in Africa. And they’re known to contribute to the overexploitation of fish on the continent through legal and illegal fishing.
Harmful subsidies
These high-sea fishing vessels come from the top 10 countries providing fisheries subsidies.
Fisheries subsidies are financial support given by governments to help the private sector, including distant-water vessels, to catch more fish. Some of these subsidies have been shown to be harmful, particularly to vulnerable species.
Harmful subsidies encourage overfishing, as the money is spent on capacity-expanding activities such as artificially lowering fuel and vessel construction costs. This allows large vessels to catch more fish than is sustainable by fishing farther out to sea and for longer periods. Many industrial fleets wouldn’t be profitable without these subsidies.
The treaty doesn’t clearly address subsidies, but they are the subject of the World Trade Organization’s 2022 Fisheries Subsidies Agreement. This, however, has not come into force as two thirds of the signatories have not yet accepted the deal. Under the proposed agreement, signatory countries must commit to stop providing harmful subsidies.
If harmful subsidies aren’t effectively addressed, a ban on fishing on the high seas could end up contributing to increased fishing activities within the jurisdictions of coastal countries.
What must happen
Aside from the treaty being effectively implemented, several measures and strategies can be deployed to ensure African countries are protected.
There must be more support from the international community for regional fisheries bodies – such as the Fisheries Committee for the West Central Gulf of Guinea and Regional Fisheries Commission for the Gulf of Guinea – for countries in west Africa. The regional bodies must be in a better position to guide member states on sustainable fisheries practices, enforce regulations where they exist or update regulations as needed.

There must be increased support in monitoring fishing. Partners and non-governmental organisations share data from satellite technology and vessel tracking systems that helps coastal states monitor what goes on in their waters. The international community must provide further support so that coastal states can enforce existing regulations by sharing capacity, technological know-how and assets.
By combining these strategies and fostering international cooperation, it is possible to strike a balance between implementing the treaty and fishing sustainably in Africa’s oceans.",New treaty to protect the world’s oceans may hurt vulnerable African fisheries,environment + energy
"In December 2023, negotiators from countries worldwide will meet in the United Arab Emirates for the next round of international climate talks. While the talks are considered essential to securing global agreements needed to avoid dangerous climate change, confidence in the summit, known as COP28, is at a low. One reason is the man in charge.
The UAE set off a firestorm in January 2023 when it announced that Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, the CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company – also known as ADNOC – would be the president-designate of the climate summit, giving him a large amount of control over the meeting’s agenda.
U.S. and European politicians demanded al-Jaber’s resignation. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore claimed that fossil fuel interests had “captured the U.N. process to a disturbing degree, even putting the CEO of one of the largest oil companies in the world in as president of COP28.”

Concerns about the role of fossil fuel industries in obstructing pro-climate policies are entirely legitimate, in my view. There is abundant evidence that the largest fossil fuel companies knew their products would cause climate change decades ago, but deliberately attempted to deny climate science and oppose climate policies.
However, I believe calls to boycott COP28 and ban the region’s choice to lead it are undermining the credibility of United Nations negotiations and are overlooking the potential of the COP28 agenda.
I am a former adviser to the U.N. Environment Program  and a scholar of environmental ethics. My own concerns about this issue led me to team up with six colleagues from across the Global South to conduct a detailed comparative analysis of the goals and behavior of the five most recent COP presidencies.
We concluded, to our surprise, that the policy agenda being promoted by the UAE’s COP28 presidency would do much to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. We also found that many criticisms of the UAE’s presidency are unfounded.
How al-Jaber was chosen
First, it’s useful to understand how COP presidents are chosen.
Choosing which country hosts a COP summit is managed by a United Nations process that rotates democratically among six regions. The countries in each region consult about who will represent their region, and that country makes a pitch, which is assessed and finalized by the secretariat that runs the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.
For COP28, the Asia-Pacific region, which consists of a diverse mix of developing nations, chose the UAE and al-Jaber.
Energy concerns of the Global South
For some Global South nations, the prospect of phasing out fossil fuels – called for by many activist groups and countries headed into COP28 – seems not only daunting, but a threat to economic development.
Of the dozens of oil-producing countries in the world, around half are middle-income developing countries with economies that are highly vulnerable to volatile oil and gas prices. Studies have suggested that a fast fossil fuel phaseout could cause trillion-dollar losses related to infrastructure investments in oil-producing countries if they aren’t prepared.
At the same time, however, many nations of the Global South face disproportionate consequences from climate change, from extreme weather events to rising sea levels that can threaten the very existence of their communities.
Al-Jaber has called phasing down fossil fuels “inevitable” and “essential”, but he has said the energy system and the Global South aren’t ready for a fast phaseout until renewable energy ramps up and that the summit should focus on adaptation. That view, while supported by some countries in the Global South, has drawn sharp criticism.
Al-Jaber, Masdar and ADNOC
Al-Jaber’s presidency of COP28 has been described by some as an attempt by the UAE to “greenwash” oil and gas expansion plans by ADNOC, one of the largest oil companies in the world.
While I am sympathetic to this concern, my colleagues and I found it to be far too simplistic. Al-Jaber spent the bulk of his career in the renewable energy sector. In 2006, he founded and ran the UAE state-owned renewable energy company, Masdar, which he helped to grow into the largest renewable operator in Africa.
He was appointed CEO of ADNOC in 2016, in the context of the UAE’s official launch of a national “post oil strategy.” The previous year, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed delivered a speech to a UAE government summit declaring that the UAE would celebrate “the last barrel of oil” by mid-century.

ADNOC has been heavily criticized for planning to invest US$150 billion in oil and gas expansion capacity this decade. I share these concerns. To stay within the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7-Fahrenheit) global warming limits adopted under the Paris Agreement, the world may need to cease new fossil fuel investments, as the International Energy Agency has urged, and also decommission some 40% of already developed fossil fuel reserves.
However, I also believe this must be viewed in a global context when discussing the COP28 presidency: Far larger fossil fuel growth plans than the UAE’s are being led by the U.S., Canada, Russia, Iran, China and Brazil. Most fossil fuel financing around the world comes from banks in the U.S., Canada and Japan. And since 2015, European banks have poured a colossal $1.3 trillion into fossil fuels, including $130 billion in 2022 alone.
The COP28 agenda
In our assessment, we found that the UAE is already providing leadership that goes beyond previous COP presidencies.
Our report found that the total value of the renewable energy projects planned by the UAE with various partners this decade adds up to over $300 billion. This is considerably bigger than clean energy investments mobilized by previous COP presidencies, our analysis found.
The COP28 agenda that the UAE is promoting also offers a promising pathway to accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels.
The agenda includes a goal of tripling renewable energy capacity within the next seven years, further driving down costs to rapidly outcompete fossil fuels, potentially within the next 20 years.
It also calls for countries to agree to eliminate fossil fuel production where carbon emissions are not captured by around midcentury, which could fast-track scaling up carbon capture, usage and storage commercially.
And restructuring climate financing to make it low-cost and reduce debt burdens, as the UAE presidency proposes, could finally unlock the trillions of dollars desperately needed by the developing world to support its energy transitions while industrializing. Given that lack of financing is the key obstacle to the energy transition in developing countries, COP28’s focus on this is critical.
Certainly, the optics of having an oil CEO lead a climate summit is concerning for anyone who advocates rapid-action phasing down of fossil fuels, and it remains to be seen how dedicated the UAE is to these policies. But I and my co-authors of the report concluded that if the COP28 summit succeeds in securing landmark agreements on the above issues, it would be a significant step forward in fast-tracking a just transition away from fossil fuels and a considerable improvement on what has been proposed in past COP summits.",Backlash to the oil CEO leading the UN climate summit overlooks his ambitious agenda for COP28 – and concerns of the Global South,politics
"It is a well-known fact that water is the key to life on Earth. But it is less well known that only about 1% of all water on the planet is fresh water available to humans, plants or land-based animals.
The rest is in the oceans, or locked up in polar ice sheets and rocks. In a climate changing world, the global distribution of that 1% takes on a whole new significance.
A new study has shown that the southern hemisphere has been drying out more than the northern hemisphere over the past two decades (2001-2020). The authors suggest the principle cause is the weather phenomenon known as El Niño, which occurs every few years when ocean water in the eastern Pacific is warmer than usual.
The findings are based on data from satellites and measurements of river and stream flows, which enabled the authors to model and calculate changes in water availability. Water availability is the net difference between the amount of water supplied to the landscape, in the form of rainfall on land, and the water removed to the atmosphere by general evaporation or by plants through their leaves.
Even though the southern hemisphere has only a quarter of the global land area (excluding Antarctica), it appears to have a substantially greater effect on global water availability than the northern hemisphere.
The new analysis reveals a strong decrease in water availability in South America, most of Africa, and central and northwestern Australia. However, some regions such as the southern part of South America will have more water available.
Trends in water availability 2001-2020. The Southern Hemisphere has more orange than blue. Zhang et al / Science, CC BY-SA
By contrast, despite significant variations between regions, the study suggests water availability in the northern hemisphere is more or less balanced. This is in part due to extensive human influences such as irrigation, dams and food production. Such factors are more relevant in the northern hemisphere since about 90% of the world population lives there.
But why does any of this rather technical modelling about water availability and drying matter? What are some possible implications if the southern hemisphere is drying out more than the northern?
What happens in the south affects the north too
Part of the answer lies in the regions likely to experience increased drying. South America includes the Amazon rainforest, which is a key regulator for the climate, as well as a globally important habitat for species and home to many Indigenous communities.
Drying of the rainforest would reduce vegetation and increase the risk of fire. This would be bad news for humans and animals that live in the forest, and has the potential to release billions of tons of carbon currently locked into forest vegetation and soils.
South America is also a major agricultural exporter of soybeans, sugar, meat, coffee and fruits for the global market. Changes in water availability will increase stress on food systems globally.
Drying across most of Africa is also a real challenge. This huge continent has many climatic zones and socio-economic contrasts, with often limited resources to mitigate and adapt.
Pressures on food systems and habitats will create additional stresses across the continent which is already suffering from increases in global food prices linked to inflation and the war in Ukraine.
Yields of the staple cassava have been declining due to droughts. And exports such as coffee and cocoa could also be reduced, leading to a spiral of loss of livelihoods, poverty and hunger.
North west Australia is going from dry to very dry. Sara Winter/ shutterstock
North-west Australia is one of the country’s great wildernesses. But it would be a major error to consider the region “empty” and therefore unimportant in terms of drying. (Like most environmental issues and concerns, it is rarely advisable to isolate one aspect from another.)
Drying will change vegetation patterns and further increase temperatures, which could be above 35°C for large parts of the year by 2100 if emission rates continue to be high. This would have severe effects on the health of humans and habitats.
Similarly, drying in central Australia has knock-on effects on weather and climate for coastal areas where most of Australia’s major cities and population are situated. Drying trends are also being experienced in the south-west and south-east of the country leading to habitat stresses and change, wildfires, depleted rivers and impacts on human health, especially in urban areas.
As with many aspects of climate, the exact nature and scale of changes and impacts are hard to predict or model at local or regional scales. But this new paper points to clear shifts in patterns and complex climate processes in the southern hemisphere which will reduce water availability during El Niño events.
Drying will generate additional stresses on habitats and species in key regions. It will also impact human populations with varying capacities to adapt and, ultimately, our global food systems. Although the southern hemisphere is mostly water, what happens there really matters for the whole planet.

"Kenya’s ambition is to reduce carbon emissions by one-third by 2030, relative to the business-as-usual scenario of 143 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. It also seeks to reduce carbon emissions to as close to zero as possible by 2050. How and whether these goals are achieved will have huge implications for the country’s economic development.
Over the past decade, Kenya has taken unprecedented measures to move towards low-carbon energy sources. Despite increasing electricity demand over the past decade, carbon emissions in the power sector have been on a decline. This is because renewable energy sources such as hydropower, geothermal, wind and solar have continued to slowly replace power plants that run on fossil fuels, such as diesel. These clean sources made up 90% of Kenya’s total energy source in 2022. Their share is likely to increase following the country’s plan to promote private sector deployment of renewable electricity at competitive bidding prices in the near future.
The challenge, not only for Kenya but for all developing countries, is that there is no template for moving to a low-carbon future while accelerating economic growth and development. Kenya seeks to achieve all three goals. The emissions, economic growth and development targets are contained in the country’s updated Nationally Determined Contributions and its economic blueprint, Vision 2030.
I have been researching the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energies in Africa for the last 16 years. As I argue in a recently published paper, Kenya could potentially achieve 100% electricity generation from clean energy sources by 2030.
This could, however, be undermined by plans to build a major coal-fired power plant from 2024. These plans are on ice after the high court suspended the plant’s licence due to environmental concerns. But if it eventually goes ahead, Kenya’s carbon emissions from the cheap and highly carbon intensive coal power plant would likely increase by 64% by 2040 compared to the 2025 level. That would reverse progress towards reducing emissions by one-third by the end of the decade.
Therefore, continued investment in renewable energy will be necessary to reduce power sector emissions, as I have argued in my paper. Such a transition should ensure universal and affordable access to electricity while creating decent green job opportunities and supporting the growth of the manufacturing sector.
Other ways of reducing emissions
Beyond electrification, a promising technology for decarbonising the industrial sector is carbon capture and storage. That is, trapping emissions from fossil fuel sources. Others are energy conservation and the production of green hydrogen.
However, the use of these technologies in Kenya’s industrial sector is still in its infancy. With the right incentives, green technologies and practices could be scaled up in existing and new industrial zones. Redirecting waste from landfills is one way. Increasing energy efficiency and conservation, through energy efficient equipment and changing behaviour, is another.
In the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector, carbon emissions are projected to increase from the equivalent of 73 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2010 to 143 million tonnes in 2030. This is mainly because of the high rate of deforestation and degradation, driven by the demand for fuel wood and charcoal. To address this, the government recently launched an initiative to plant 15 billion trees by 2032. The national policy objective is to attain a 30% tree cover by 2050 from the current cover of 12.13%.
Other important sources of emissions in Kenya are transport and residential cooking.
Decarbonising the transport sector
Kenya signed the COP26 declaration on “accelerating the transition to 100% zero-emission cars and vans”. Several national policy documents indicate the importance of electric mobility for low-emissions transport. Electric vehicles are therefore projected to make up about 5% of vehicle imports by 2025.
Besides, Kenya seeks to replace diesel-powered trains with electric ones, and turn to electrified urban buses. These are expected to play a much bigger role in the future transport sector.
Despite these and other policy measures, low levels of investment mean that road transport emissions are likely to increase between four- and 31-fold from 2010 to 2050. Investment is therefore needed in public charging stations and servicing for e-mobility. And private sector actors and startups in this area need financial incentives to reduce the high initial cost of investment.
Cutting household cooking emissions
In 2019, Kenya’s residential cooking carbon emissions were estimated to amount to the equivalent of 24.8 megatonnes of carbon dioxide annually, compared to the national total of 93.7 megatonnes. This is because a mere 24% of the population use clean cooking technologies and fuels. In spite of this, Kenya aims to achieve universal access to clean cooking by 2028 by promoting liquefied petroleum gas, bio-ethanol and other clean fuels.
Highly efficient wood stoves alone can reduce fuel wood use by 30%-60%. This can save about 624 hectares of forest and avoid the equivalent of 45,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. But improved cookstoves and fuel are expensive. That’s why 75% of Kenyan families continue to rely on charcoal and firewood as their choice of cooking energy.
Transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy
Although Kenya has plans to transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy, implementation remains a major challenge. The government can take the following actions to address this issue:
Use the draft National Green Fiscal Incentives Policy Framework to attract private-sector green investment at scale.
Work with think tanks, international NGOs and universities to develop bankable project proposals for the Global Environment Facility, Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund.
Facilitate partnerships with the World Bank’s green bond programme and the African Development Bank’s Africa Green Bank Initiative to scale climate actions and low-carbon energy transitions.
Collaborate with development finance institutions, investors and international development organisations to refinance a portion of national debt at lower interest rates and longer repayment terms. This would provide savings to channel into low-carbon, climate-resilient development projects.
Set up a comprehensive national incubation programme to test and commercialise local green innovations by offering training, business development, technology and finance support.
Climate-proof infrastructure, community and other development projects to protect lives and livelihoods, and reduce direct losses from floods and droughts.","Climate change: Kenya’s power sector is a shining example, the big hurdles are household and transport emissions",environment + energy
"Feeding a growing world population has been a serious concern for decades, but today there are new causes for alarm. Floods, heat waves and other weather extremes are making agriculture increasingly precarious, especially in the Global South.
The war in Ukraine is also a factor. Russia is blockading Ukrainian grain exports, and fertilizer prices have surged because of trade sanctions on Russia, the world’s leading fertilizer exporter.
Amid these challenges, some organizations are renewing calls for a second Green Revolution, echoing the introduction in the 1960s and 1970s of supposedly high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice into developing countries, along with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Those efforts centered on India and other Asian countries; today, advocates focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where the original Green Revolution regime never took hold.
In this Oct. 25, 2000, episode of the television drama ‘The West Wing,’ president Josiah Bartlet invokes the standard account of Green Revolution seeds saving millions from starvation.
But anyone concerned with food production should be careful what they wish for. In recent years, a wave of new analysis has spurred a critical rethinking of what Green Revolution-style farming really means for food supplies and self-sufficiency.
As I explain in my book, “The Agricultural Dilemma: How Not to Feed the World,” the Green Revolution does hold lessons for food production today – but not the ones that are commonly heard. Events in India show why.
A triumphal narrative
There was a consensus in the 1960s among development officials and the public that an overpopulated Earth was heading toward catastrophe. Paul Ehrlich’s 1968 bestseller, “The Population Bomb,” famously predicted that nothing could stop “hundreds of millions” from starving in the 1970s.
India was the global poster child for this looming Malthusian disaster: Its population was booming, drought was ravaging its countryside and its imports of American wheat were climbing to levels that alarmed government officials in India and the U.S.
Then, in 1967, India began distributing new wheat varieties bred by Rockefeller Foundation plant biologist Norman Borlaug, along with high doses of chemical fertilizer. After famine failed to materialize, observers credited the new farming strategy with enabling India to feed itself.
Borlaug received the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize and is still widely credited with “saving a billion lives.” Indian agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan, who worked with Borlaug to promote the Green Revolution, received the inaugural World Food Prize in 1987. Tributes to Swaminathan, who died on Sept. 28, 2023, at age 98, have reiterated the claim that his efforts brought India “self-sufficiency in food production” and independence from Western powers.

Debunking the legend
The standard legend of India’s Green Revolution centers on two propositions. First, India faced a food crisis, with farms mired in tradition and unable to feed an exploding population; and second, Borlaug’s wheat seeds led to record harvests from 1968 on, replacing import dependence with food self-sufficiency.
Recent research shows that both claims are false.
India was importing wheat in the 1960s because of policy decisions, not overpopulation. After the nation achieved independence in 1947, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru prioritized developing heavy industry. U.S. advisers encouraged this strategy and offered to provide India with surplus grain, which India accepted as cheap food for urban workers.
Meanwhile, the government urged Indian farmers to grow nonfood export crops to earn foreign currency. They switched millions of acres from rice to jute production, and by the mid-1960s India was exporting agricultural products.
Borlaug’s miracle seeds were not inherently more productive than many Indian wheat varieties. Rather, they just responded more effectively to high doses of chemical fertilizer. But while India had abundant manure from its cows, it produced almost no chemical fertilizer. It had to start spending heavily to import and subsidize fertilizer.
India did see a wheat boom after 1967, but there is evidence that this expensive new input-intensive approach was not the main cause. Rather, the Indian government established a new policy of paying higher prices for wheat. Unsurprisingly, Indian farmers planted more wheat and less of other crops.
Once India’s 1965-67 drought ended and the Green Revolution began, wheat production sped up, while production trends in other crops like rice, maize and pulses slowed down. Net food grain production, which was much more crucial than wheat production alone, actually resumed at the same growth rate as before.
But grain production became more erratic, forcing India to resume importing food by the mid-1970s. India also became dramatically more dependent on chemical fertilizer.
India’s Green Revolution wheat boom came at the expense of other crops; the growth rate of overall food grain production did not increase at all. It is doubtful that the ‘revolution’ produced any more food than would have been produced anyway. What increased dramatically was dependence on imported fertilizer. Glenn Davis Stone; data from India Directorate of Economics and Statistics and Fertiliser Association of India, CC BY-ND
According to data from Indian economic and agricultural organizations, on the eve of the Green Revolution in 1965, Indian farmers needed 17 pounds (8 kilograms) of fertilizer to grow an average ton of food. By 1980, it took 96 pounds (44 kilograms). So, India replaced imports of wheat, which were virtually free food aid, with imports of fossil fuel-based fertilizer, paid for with precious international currency.
Today, India remains the world’s second-highest fertilizer importer, spending US$17.3 billion in 2022. Perversely, Green Revolution boosters call this extreme and expensive dependence “self-sufficiency.”
The toll of ‘green’ pollution
Recent research shows that the environmental costs of the Green Revolution are as severe as its economic impacts. One reason is that fertilizer use is astonishingly wasteful. Globally, only 17% of what is applied is taken up by plants and ultimately consumed as food. Most of the rest washes into waterways, where it creates algae blooms and dead zones that smother aquatic life. Producing and using fertilizer also generates copious greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
Excess nutrients are creating dead zones in water bodies worldwide. Synthetic fertilizer is a major source.
In Punjab, India’s top Green Revolution state, heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides has contaminated water, soil and food and endangered human health.
In my view, African countries where the Green Revolution has not made inroads should consider themselves lucky. Ethiopia offers a cautionary case. In recent years, the Ethiopian government has forced farmers to plant increasing amounts of fertilizer-intensive wheat, claiming this will achieve “self-sufficiency” and even allow it to export wheat worth $105 million this year. Some African officials hail this strategy as an example for the continent.
But Ethiopia has no fertilizer factories, so it has to import it – at a cost of $1 billion just in the past year. Even so, many farmers face severe fertilizer shortages.
The Green Revolution still has many boosters today, especially among biotech companies that are eager to draw parallels between genetically engineered crops and Borlaug’s seeds. I agree that it offers important lessons about how to move forward with food production, but actual data tells a distinctly different story from the standard narrative. In my view, there are many ways to pursue less input-intensive agriculture that will be more sustainable in a world with an increasingly erratic climate.","The Green Revolution is a warning, not a blueprint for feeding a hungry planet",environment + energy
"Whether the water at your local beach is being roiled by nasty weather or is a perfectly calm expanse of blue, there’s always a great deal going on under the surface. The ocean is composed of various currents and water masses; those currents flow around the world through what is called thermohaline circulation.
This circulation drives the distribution of heat, salinity and nutrients throughout the world’s oceans, ensuring that our whole planet is habitable for life.
The Atlantic leg of this circulation is called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The Atlantic Ocean is situated between the Americas, western Europe and the western margin of Africa. The AMOC distributes heat away from the tropics northward, ensuring that tropical regions are not overheated, which would cause an imbalance in climate. It, like other oceanographic systems, varies annually, over decades and centennially. Scientists study these oceanographic systems over a longer time period to understand how they work and to make predictions on how they will function in future and what their impact may be.
In July 2023 two Danish academics – physicist Peter Ditlevsen and his sister, the statistician Susanne Ditlevsen – published a paper in which they stated that the AMOC was in decline and would likely shut down mid-century. That would bring dramatic consequences: rising sea levels, global heating, shifts in marine ecosystems, and seriously compromised food security. It could also seriously affect the upwelling marine ecosystem along the western margin of South Africa and Namibia, which is the most productive upwelling system in the Atlantic.
In the Ditlevsens’ scenario, Europe could see massive cooling of around 5°C to 10°C and the tropics could become overheated. Certain areas around the world would experience severe droughts and flooding. And the oceans would become more acidic.
The paper has generated controversy in the scientific community. As a geologist whose research interests include oceanographic change, I don’t find the article surprising. Research has shown that the AMOC has not been a stable feature of the ocean over millions of years and is sensitive to climate change. However, I agree with the general scientific consensus: the shutdown of the AMOC will not be as abrupt as the paper claims; it will instead be more gradual over the coming centuries.
Constant shifts
The Atlantic Ocean is not the only part of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation that is experiencing shifts. In the South Indian Ocean, the Agulhas Current is also weakening due to changing distribution in heat and freshwater from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean.
And in the Pacific Ocean, west of the Americas, El Niño events – the warming of that specific ocean – are intensifying.
The Ditlevsens based their findings largely on sea surface temperatures. The paper does not consider other factors such as which carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels in the atmosphere (and take-up by the oceans), coupled with temperature changes, would be the tipping point for the AMOC to shut down, or the state of deep water generation – water of specific density, salinity and temperature – at the source regions in the North Atlantic for the functioning of the AMOC.
The broad consensus among scientists is that, while the AMOC is weakening, the probability of it completely shutting down in this century is low.
Read more: Atlantic collapse: Q&A with scientists behind controversial study predicting a colder Europe
It’s also important to point out that ocean currents and circulation change over time. The AMOC has strengthened and waned pre-human history over geological time, particularly in response to colder or warmer periods. For example, studies along the western margin of South Africa have found that the AMOC in the South Atlantic is sensitive to changes in the global climate cycle.
The Atlantic Ocean is stratified with different water masses crucial to the functioning of the AMOC.
Previous research has also indicated that the AMOC weakened or shut down before, thousands of years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum. That happened under different conditions than what we are experiencing today. During that time the climate was much colder and the ice sheets were at a maximum position, although a warming phase led to the retreat of ice sheets afterwards.
Perspective
This large body of evidence suggests that the AMOC will continue to weaken as currents fluctuate over time, driven by different environmental factors. But scientists have not yet accepted that a total shutdown of the system will occur over the next few years or couple of decades.
However, the paper that’s caused so much controversy shouldn’t be dismissed entirely. For one thing, it’s a good conversation starter on this very important topic. It also provides a timeline for when the AMOC could shut down – anywhere between 2025 and 2095. While the consensus is that this isn’t accurate, it’s a useful starting point from which other scientists could generate scenarios and models for further study.
In doing so, our collective understanding of the AMOC system will deepen, which should influence policy decision-making.",The Atlantic Ocean’s major current system is slowing down – but a 21st century collapse is unlikely,environment + energy
"Climate risks can be complex to deal with because they don’t respect country borders. Hazards in one region can have negative repercussions in another. These are known as transboundary climate risks, and they’re a growing concern. They require coordinated, multinational responses, which can be a challenge given the different priorities and capabilities of each country.
A transboundary climate risk could be due to a shared ecosystem, such as a river basin. For instance the Nile river, which flows through 11 countries, can experience variations in water availability due to changes in the weather. This will affect the millions who depend on it.
Transboundary climate risks can also cross continents and oceans and spawn crises on the other side of the world. These could range from food and water shortages to threats to trade and energy, widening inequalities, forced migrations and even geopolitical conflicts.
For instance a drought in East Africa could affect tea production in Kenya. This would lead to an increase in prices for tea drinkers in importing countries, like the UK. Likewise, a typhoon could affect manufacturers in south-east Asia. This could disrupt the supply of electronics to African markets and lead to price hikes or shortages.
Africa is particularly vulnerable. Trade routes, supply chains and shared ecosystems span across the continent. A climate-induced disruption in one country can easily ripple into cascading effects in its neighbours. The coordinated management of transboundary climate risks is both a challenge and a necessity.
At the recent Africa climate summit in Kenya, the African Union and other African stakeholders presented the Roadmap for African Resilience to address this.
The roadmap contains a series of actions meant to enhance coordination between the regional economic communities and member states in addressing and managing transboundary and cascading climate risks. This is an objective of the African Union’s Climate Change and Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan 2022–2032.
Historically, adaptation efforts have largely addressed localised impacts, such as rising sea levels and coastal communities or frequent droughts and their impact on agricultural yields.
As an expert on adaptation to climate change, I believe that the significance of this roadmap lies in its comprehensive, continent-wide approach. It recognises that shared challenges require shared solutions. And it underscores Africa’s commitment to taking charge of its climate destiny. This makes the roadmap valuable in the evolving discourse on global climate resilience.
Unified front
The Roadmap for African Resilience outlines 25 crucial actions to fortify Africa’s resilience against transboundary climate risks. It has a focus on the risks posed to global supply chains, energy and food markets.
The roadmap’s actions can be grouped into four general plans:
Recognise the risks: this includes a pan-African transboundary climate risk assessment and the development of risk indicators.
Govern together: identify the transboundary risks that each country considers most important. These will be included in different areas of policy.
Implement Africa-wide adaptation: create a plan to find the best ways to strengthen communities against transboundary climate risks. Just resilience principles are embedded into this, such as prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable people and upholding human rights and cultural values. The roadmap also kickstarts a programme to put these ideas into action.
Mobilise resources for resilience: getting more money from multiple countries to support climate action, making sure private investments match public goals by emphasising systemic resilience, and building capacity to invest together.
The Roadmap for African Resilience thus offers a holistic, pan-African vision. It not only identifies transboundary climate risks but also proposes a structured approach for collective action.
Implementing the roadmap requires the active involvement of a range of African organisations. These include the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union Commission, the African Union Development Agency – New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the African Group of Negotiators Expert Support and the Regional Economic Communities in Africa. In addition, national governments, the private sector, civil society and academia play crucial roles.
The challenge will lie in ensuring cohesive action among these entities. Especially when adaptation to climate risks is a relatively new endeavour for some of the above organisations.
Significant step
The inaugural Africa Climate Summit marked a significant step for Africa’s collective commitment to resilience. The roadmap acknowledges the reality of Africa’s intertwined destinies and the need for collaborative solutions to cross-border climate risks.
Given the borderless nature of climate risks, global cooperation must be at the heart of adaptation initiatives.

"The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are being challenged to make substantial reforms so that they become fit for purpose in the 21st century.
Some suggest that they cannot be sufficiently reformed and should be shut down. Others, including myself, contend the world needs effective international financial institutions. If they did not exist, we would have to create them. Consequently, we must try to make them more credible, legitimate, inclusive, responsible and effective. The challenge is doing so within the constraints of their founding treaties.
This article is based on my book The Law of International Financial Institutions. It provides some background on these institutions and discusses the problems they are confronting and their potential for reform.
Some history
Prior to 1944, countries fixed the value of their currencies in terms of gold. This system collapsed with tragic consequences in the inter-war years.
The purpose of the 1944 Bretton Woods conference was to create a new international monetary order. It was an exclusive affair. Only 44 out of the then 99 officially recognised countries were represented. A large portion of humanity was living under colonial domination and didn’t take part in the negotiations.
Four characteristics of this new international order are noteworthy.
First, it created the first rules-based international monetary system. The participating states agreed that the IMF would oversee the new order. In return, both the IMF and World Bank offered their member states financing. The financing came with terms and conditions and the IMF and the World Bank could hold the states accountable for failing to comply with them.
Second, the member states accepted that the governance of the institutions would be based on weighted voting, with each member state receiving a vote that corresponded to its economic size and financial contribution. This effectively modified the principle of sovereign equality which is at the core of the international legal order. A state could be outvoted and forced to comply with policies that it opposed.
Third, the legal status and powers of these new institutions was only clarified over time. Most significantly, they were given immunity to mitigate the risk that a member state would use its authority to interfere with their operations in that state. Therefore, they cannot be sued in any court in the world.
Fourth, the treaties are silent on their environmental and social responsibilities.
Evolution
By the mid-1970s, the two institutions were operating in a very different world. Many states in Africa and Asia had become independent and had joined them. They had different needs and priorities from the original member states. However, because of their relative level of economic development, they lacked the votes to change policies and priorities.
Second, the system created at Bretton Woods collapsed in 1973. It was replaced by a system in which markets played a great role in determining the value of currencies and each state could decide for itself how to conduct its own monetary policy.
Third, concerns about the environmental and social impacts of economic activity were beginning to grow around the world. It resulted in controversies involving projects funded by the World Bank and programmes funded by the IMF.
Fifth, civil society organisations were becoming more important actors. They were concerned that the operations of these institutions were causing substantial harm to local communities and the environment. They began to campaign for the World Bank and IMF to become more transparent and accountable.
The two institutions have made some efforts to respond to these developments.
Governance. The number of member states increased by over four times between 1946 and 2023. However, the size of their boards of executive directors has only doubled. This means that it is harder for many states to have their concerns about policies, procedures and operations raised at the board level.
Consequently, the institutions are likely to be less responsive to the concerns of their smaller and poorer member states than to their richer and more powerful member states.
This problem is exacerbated by the institutions’ declining financial capacity. When the IMF opened for business, its total resources were equivalent to 3% of a global GDP of about US$10 trillion (in 2011 dollars). Today, they are equivalent to about 1% of a global GDP of about US$100 trillion.
Responsibility. The institutions have acknowledged their responsibility for the environmental and social impacts of their operations and that there are some human rights issues that are relevant to their operations. However, they have struggled to develop an effective and sustainable approach to these issues.
One reason is that there is no agreement on which standards they should use in addressing these issues.
A second reason is that understanding these issues requires them to do impact assessments and to consult with affected stakeholders. But both require them to interact with a broader range of stakeholders in their member states than was originally envisaged. It may also require them to engage with groups that are opposed to the projects or policies.
In response, the World Bank has developed its own operational policies and procedures for its staff. They also educate external actors about what they can expect from the bank in regard to environmental and social issues. This is not always acceptable to their member states.
The IMF has maintained that, because it focuses on macro-economic issues and policy based finance, it is difficult to establish causal links between its operations and their environmental and social impacts. But it has now acknowledged that these issues can be “macro-critical” and that it needs to pay attention to them. It has not yet adequately explained how it will do this.
Accountability. The expanding role and responsibilities of the World Bank and IMF raise complex issues. There is a risk that they will make mistakes that result in some stakeholders having to assume an unreasonably high share of the costs of these projects or policies.
In 1993, the World Bank created an independent accountability mechanism, the Inspection Panel. Despite its shortcomings, it was an important international legal development.
The IMF has not established its own independent accountability mechanism. It is one of the few international organisations that does not offer its external stakeholders any means for holding it accountable.
What next?
The World Bank and IMF need to continue evolving if they are to remain fit for purpose in the 21st century. They need to develop governance arrangements, operational policies based on international norms and standards, and accountability structures that respond adequately to the challenges of climate, poverty, inequality and discrimination. Their richer member states need to provide them with adequate resources to fulfil their mission.",The World Bank and the IMF need to keep reforming to become fit for purpose,home page
"South Africa is renowned for having one of the world’s biggest populations of great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias). Substantial declines have been observed, however, in places where the sharks normally gather on the coast of the Western Cape province. Sharks congregate at these locations to feed, interact socially, or rest.
In Cape Town, skilled “shark spotters” documented a peak of over 300 great white shark sightings across eight beaches in 2011, but have recorded no sightings since 2019. These declines have sparked concerns about the overall conservation status of the species.
Conserving great white sharks is vital because they have a pivotal role in marine ecosystems. As top predators, they help maintain the health and balance of marine food webs. Their presence influences the behaviour of other marine animals, affecting the entire ecosystem’s structure and stability.
Marine biologists like us needed to know whether the decline in shark numbers in the Western Cape indicated changes in the whole South African population or whether the sharks had moved to a different location.
To investigate this problem, we undertook an extensive study using data collected by scientists, tour operators and shore anglers. We examined the trends over time in abundance and shifts in distribution across the sharks’ South African range.
Our investigation revealed significant differences in the abundance at primary gathering sites. There were declines at some locations; others showed increases or stability. Overall, there appears to be a stable trend. This suggests that white shark numbers have remained constant since they were given protection in 1991.
Looking at the potential change in the distribution of sharks between locations, we discovered a shift in human-shark interactions from the Western Cape to the Eastern Cape. More research is required to be sure whether the sharks that vanished from the Western Cape are the same sharks documented along the Eastern Cape.
Shark trends in South Africa. Bowlby HD, et al., Author provided (no reuse)
The stable population of white sharks is reassuring, but the distribution shift introduces its own challenges, such as the risk posed by fisheries, and the need for beach management. So there is a need for better monitoring of where the sharks are.
Factors influencing shark movements
We recorded the biggest changes between 2015 and 2020. For example, at Seal Island, False Bay (Western Cape), shark sightings declined from 2.5 sightings per hour in 2005 to 0.6 in 2017. Shifting eastward to Algoa Bay, in 2013, shore anglers caught only six individual sharks. By 2019, this figure had risen to 59.
The changes at each site are complex, however. Understanding the patterns remains challenging.
These predators can live for more than 70 years. Each life stage comes with distinct behaviours: juveniles, especially males, tend to stay close to the coastline, while sub-adults and adults, particularly females, venture offshore.
Environmental factors like water temperature, lunar phase, season and food availability further influence their movement patterns.
Changes in the climate and ocean over extended periods might also come into play.
As adaptable predators, they target a wide range of prey and thrive in a broad range of temperatures, with a preference for 14–24°C. Their migratory nature allows them to seek optimal conditions when faced with unfavourable environments.
Predation of sharks by killer whales
The movement complexity deepens with the involvement of specialist killer whales with a taste for shark livers. Recently, these apex predators have been observed preying on white, sevengill and bronze whaler sharks.
Cases were first documented in 2015 along the South African coast, coinciding with significant behavioural shifts in white sharks within Gansbaai and False Bay.
Although a direct cause-and-effect link is not firmly established, observations and tracking data support the notion of a distinct flight response among white sharks following confirmed predation incidents.
More recently, it was clear that in Mossel Bay, when a killer whale pod killed at least three white sharks, the remaining sharks were prompted to leave the area.
Survival and conservation of sharks
The risk landscape for white sharks is complex. A study published in 2022 showed a notable overlap of white sharks with longline and gillnet fisheries, extending across 25% of South Africa’s Exclusive Economic Zone. The sharks spent 15% of their time exposed to these fisheries.
The highest white shark catches were reported in KwaZulu-Natal, averaging around 32 per year. This emphasised the need to combine shark movement with reliable catch records to assess risks to shark populations.
As shark movement patterns shift eastward, the potential change in risk must be considered. Increased overlap between white sharks, shark nets, drumlines (baited hooks) and gillnets might increase the likelihood of captures.
Beach safety and management adaptation
Although shark bites remain a low risk, changing shark movements could also influence beach safety. The presence of sharks can influence human activities, particularly in popular swimming and water sports areas. Adjusting existing shark management strategies might be necessary as distributions change.
Increased signage, temporary beach closures, or improved education about shark behaviour might be needed.

In Cape Town, for example, shark spotters have adjusted their efforts on specific beaches. Following two fatal shark incidents in 2022, their programme expanded to Plettenberg Bay. Anecdotal evidence highlights additional Eastern Cape locations where surfers and divers encounter more white sharks than before.
Enhanced monitoring and long-term programmes
Further research is required to understand the factors behind the movements of sharks and their impact on distribution over space and time. Our study underscores the importance of standardising data collection methods to generate reliable abundance statistics across their entire range. Other countries suffer from the same problem.
Additionally, we propose establishing long-term monitoring programmes along the Eastern Cape and continuing work to reduce the number of shark deaths.

"As Africa gets hotter, mothers and babies are most at risk. Why is this and what can be done about it? Matthew Chersich, a specialist in climate change and maternal health, explains the reasons to health editor Nadine Dreyer.
What makes pregnant women particularly vulnerable to extreme heat?
Many women in Africa have little or no protection against extreme heat events, with pregnancy being an particularly vulnerable period. High ambient temperatures may overwhelm the capacity of the maternal thermoregulatory mechanisms to dissipate heat in pregnancy.
Foetal metabolism generates considerable heat in the mother’s body. Then there is the strain from additional weight gain in pregnancy, fat deposits that retain heat, and the major exertion of labour and childbirth.
The foetus remains around 0.5°C warmer than the mother and thus if a mother has heat stress or a fever, the foetal temperature quickly reaches dangerous levels.
The most dangerous period is likely during childbirth, when women generate remarkable levels of heat from the labour process. If this occurs during a heatwave it can increase complications, such as prolonged labour, increased emergency caesarean sections and maternal haemorrhage.
What makes babies particularly vulnerable?
Infants are dependent on their carers for protecting them against heat exposure. Some practices, such as over-swaddling, pose considerable risks as global temperatures rise.
Dehydration is also a major concern for young children, due to water loss through sweating or from gastroenteritis, which increases as food- and water-borne pathogens replicate more frequently and survive longer during warm weather.
Mothers may also supplement breastfeeding with water. In many areas, water is unsafe because of poor infrastructure.
Infants may breastfeed for shorter periods during hot weather as feeding can be uncomfortable for baby and mother in the heat.
In one of our studies in Burkina Faso, breastfeeding duration was about 25 minutes shorter on hot days compared to cold days.
It is possible to quantify the effect of climate change on pregnant women and newborn babies?
We are able to calculate the relative risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm birth, which increases about 1.15 fold during heatwaves. The key gap in the field is quantifying the absolute number of additional adverse outcomes that are occurring because of climate change.
Those figures would help people to appreciate the implications of climate change for maternal and child health. There are real concerns that extreme heat may reverse the previous gains made in maternal and child health, from childhood vaccines, for example.
In some of our work we estimated how many additional child deaths occurred in Africa from heat exposure. We showed that there were between 7,000 and 11,000 deaths from heat exposure in children in Africa annually that could be attributed to climate change. Unless we curb carbon emissions dramatically, heat-related child mortality in Africa may reach over 38,000 a year in 2049.
A study of pregnant women in Johannesburg showed that rates of severe hypertensive disorders in pregnancy increase by as much as 80% when temperatures exceed 23°C in early pregnancy.
Do different health issues affect mothers and children?
While the harms of exposure to extreme heat in pregnancy are well known, we do not yet have easy ways of calculating how much of that additional burden of disease is due to climate change, as opposed to natural variations in temperature. The methods for doing so are improving rapidly, however.
What is clear is that if South Africa experiences the kinds of temperatures that were seen in Europe and North America in 2023, there will be many thousands of additional pregnancy complications, all of which will be directly attributable to climate change.
What are some practical solutions?
There are a number of relatively simple, low cost “cooling” interventions which could be implemented at scale if countries in the global north kept to their funding commitments.
Each year high-income countries make major promises about climate financing, but have yet to deliver. They committed US$100 billion a year in the 2015 Paris Agreement and have delivered only a tiny fraction of that amount.
Low-cost interventions include painting roofs of houses or health facilities with white reflective paint, fans with evaporative cooling, providing cool water for women during labour and making “cooling centres” where women could go during a heatwave.
What can pregnant women and communities do to reduce risks?
On a local level there are behavioural changes that can benefit maternal health. Many pregnant women continue physical work even late in pregnancy, including walking long distances to collect water and firewood. A project in Burkina Faso and Kenya tested a community-mobilisation intervention that aimed to reduce heavy workloads during pregnancy and early motherhood. Results of the project are promising.
Major changes must be made to built environments. The temperatures in many informal settlements are higher indoors than they are outdoors, which can be devastating for expectant mothers. Higher night-time temperatures are especially concerning. Many healthcare facilities are similarly ill-equipped to provide pregnant women with cooler environments.
All the interventions mentioned above can provide some degree of protection against the current level of heat exposure women face, but will be poorly effective against the kinds of temperatures that we will experience in five to 10 years’ time.
We know almost nothing about what could be done to prevent mass mortality events at temperatures around 50-55°C in settings where air conditioning is not feasible and the population is not accustomed to those temperatures.",Why mothers and babies will suffer more as Africa grows hotter,health + medicine
"The run of extreme weather events around the world seems to be never-ending. After the northern summer of extreme heat and disastrous fires, we’ve seen more exceptional autumn weather over Europe with record-breaking heat in the UK.
Meanwhile, record-breaking rain and intense flash floods struck Greece before the same storm devastated Libya, with thousands dead.
Almost 20% of Africa is estimated to be in drought, and drought conditions are returning to parts of Australia. To top it off, we’ve seen several hurricanes intensify unusually quickly in the Atlantic.
We know climate change underpins some of the more extreme weather we’re seeing. But is it also pushing these extreme events to happen faster?
The answer? Generally, yes. Here’s how.
Droughts can build up more quickly if there’s hotter temperatures and lower humidity. Joel B. Pratley/AAP
Flash droughts
We usually think of droughts as slowly evolving extreme events which take months to form.
But that’s no longer a given. We’ve seen some recent droughts develop unexpectedly quickly, giving rise to the phrase “flash drought”.
How does this happen? It’s when a lack of rainfall in a region combines with high temperatures and sunny conditions with low humidity. When these conditions are in place, it increases how much moisture the atmosphere is trying to pull from the land through evaporation. The end result: faster drying-out of the ground.
Flash droughts tend to be short, so they don’t tend to cause the major water shortages or dry river beds we’ve seen during long droughts in parts of Australia and South Africa, for example. But they can cause real problems for farmers. Farmers in parts of eastern Australia are already grappling with the sudden return of drought after three years of rainy La Niña conditions.
As we continue to warm the planet, we’ll see more flash droughts and more intense ones. That’s because dry conditions will more often coincide with higher temperatures as relative humidity falls across many land regions.
A dry winter in many Australian coastal food-producing regions may herald an unwelcome drought. Bureau of Meteorology
Flash floods and extreme rainfall
Climate change can cause increased rainfall variability. Some parts of the world will get a lot wetter, on average, while others will get drier, increasing the variation in rainfall between different regions. For Australia, most locations are generally expected to have intensified downpours of rain, as well as intensified droughts. So we might be saying more often “it doesn’t rain, it pours!”.
We’re seeing exceptionally extreme rainfall in many recent events. The recent floods that submerged villages in Greece came from a sudden downpour of over 500 millimetres in a single day. Hong Kong was hit last week by the heaviest rains in 140 years, flooding subway stations and turning streets into rivers.
But why does it happen so quickly?
Sudden extreme rains fall when we have very moist air coupled with a weather system that forces air to rise.
We’ve long known human-caused climate change is increasing how much moisture the air can hold generally, rising by about 7% per degree of global warming. That means storms now have the potential to hold and dump more water.
Notably, the impact of climate change on rain-bearing weather systems can vary by region, which makes the picture more complicated. That means, for instance, climate change may lead to more extreme rain in some places, while other places may only see an intensification in really short extreme rain events and not for longer timescales.
We can safely say, though, that in most parts of the world, we’re seeing more intense storms and sudden extreme rainfall. Sudden dumps of rain drive flash floods.
More moisture in the air helps fuel more intense convection, where warm air masses rise and form clouds. In turn, this can trigger efficient, quick and intense dumps of rain from thunderstorms.
These short-duration rain events can be much larger than you’d expect from the 7% increase in moisture per degree of warming.

Flash cyclones? Hurricanes are intensifying faster
Last month, Hurricane Idalia caused major flooding in Florida. As we write, Hurricane Lee is approaching the US.
Both tropical storms had something odd about them – unusually rapid intensification. That is, they got much stronger in a short period of time.
Hurricane Lee strengthened from a Category 3 to a Category 5 remarkably quickly. AP/NOAA
Usually, this process might increase wind speeds by about 50 kilometres per hour over a 24-hour period for a hurricane – also known as tropical cyclones and typhoons. But Lee’s wind speeds increased by 129km/h over that period. US meteorological expert Marshall Shepherd has dubbed the phenomenon “hyperintensification”, which could put major population centres at risk.
Rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones are strong and can be very hazardous, but they aren’t very common. To trigger them, you need a combination of very high sea surface temperatures, moist air and wind speeds that don’t change much with height.
While still uncommon, rapid intensification is potentially getting more frequent as we heat the planet. This is because oceans have taken up so much of the heat and there’s more moisture in the air. There’s much more still to learn here.
Australia’s El Niño summer in a warming world
Spring and summer in Australia are likely to be warmer and drier than usual. This is due to the El Niño climate cycle predicted for the Pacific Ocean. If, as predicted, we also get a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event, this can heighten the hotter, drier weather brought by El Niño. After three wet La Niña years, this is likely to be a marked shift.
Read more: When the Indian Ocean and El Niño join forces, things can get hot and dry
If it arrives as expected, El Niño would lower the risk of tropical cyclones for northern Australia and reduce chances of heavy rain across most of the continent.
But for farmers, it may help trigger flash droughts. Prevailing warm and dry conditions may rapidly dry the land and reduce crop yields and slow livestock growth.
Drier surfaces coupled with grass growth from the wet years could worsen fire risk. Grass can dry out much faster than shrubs or trees, and grass fires can start and spread very rapidly.
Climate change loads the dice for extreme weather. And as we’re now seeing, these extremes aren’t just more intense – they can happen remarkably fast.

"Climate change has negatively – and irreversibly, in some cases – affected ecosystems around the globe. Sadly, though, it is not the only phenomenon that’s altering our natural world.
In 2019, the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment Report confirmed invasive alien species as one of the five most important direct drivers of biodiversity loss. The others were climate change, land and sea use, direct exploitation of species, and pollution.
IPBES, an independent intergovernmental body, was established in 2012. It now has 144 member countries; Somalia, the newest member, joined in mid-September. Its major objective is to strengthen the interface between science and policy to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity.
The 2019 assessment found that more than 37,000 alien species had been introduced by many human activities to regions and biomes around the world, most in the past 100 years. A new report by the organisation, focused on alien invasive species, suggests this number is rising fast, with new alien species being recorded at an unprecedented rate of approximately 200 annually. It also reveals that the global economic cost of invasive alien species exceeded US$423 billion annually. Costs have at least quadrupled every decade since 1970.
But the new report doesn’t just concentrate on problems. It also offers solutions. It outlines key responses and policy options that governments may take for prevention, early detection and effective control of invasive alien species. Doing so will help to safeguard nature and its contributions to people. This will ensure a better quality of life for all.
Read more: The true damage of invasive alien species was just revealed in a landmark report. Here's how we must act
I am an invasion biologist whose research focuses on the ecology and management of invasive aquatic plants. Here, I elaborate on the four key messages highlighted by the report that African countries should heed if the continent is to successfully tackle the threats posed by invasive species.
Key messages
1: Invasive alien species are a major threat to nature, its contributions to people, and good quality of life.
In Africa, invasive species threaten food security by negatively affecting fish production, agricultural productivity, grazing and water supplies.
The introduction of the Nile perch, Lates niloticus, into East Africa’s Lake Victoria in 1954 is one of the most extreme examples. Predation by this species caused the extinction of approximately 200 species of cichlids from the lake. It is considered to represent the largest extinction event among vertebrates during the 20th century.
The invasion also resulted in the shallow lake becoming enriched with nutrients as people came to fish for Nile perch. This resulted in the widespread invasion of the lake by water hyacinth. The plant restricted access to the lake, which prevented transport and fishing.
2: Globally, invasive alien species and their impacts are increasing rapidly and are predicted to continue rising in the future. Accurate data is crucial.
A 2021 research study highlighted that the reported economic costs of invasive aquatic species were unevenly distributed across geographic regions. Africa, the Oceania-Pacific Islands and the Antarctic-Subantarctic, combined, accounted for only 0.6% of the US$345 billion global estimate. That’s not because the costs are really that low. The data simply isn’t being recorded, so we’re not getting the full picture.
African countries need to partner with their neighbours in better quantifying the situation.
3: Invasive alien species and their negative impact can only be prevented and mitigated through effective management.
In 2011 the Convention on Biological Diversity released its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The 20 targets were designed to address and mitigate biodiversity loss across the globe. Target 9 stated that, by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways should be identified and prioritised. Priority species should be controlled or eradicated, and measures taken to block new pathways.
But none of those targets were met. And there has been little or no progress recorded in some African countries. Today, invasive species are reported to be adversely affecting livelihoods in more than 70% of African countries.
Constrained financial resources and the lack of legal frameworks and related operational systems are largely to blame for the lack of progress. For example, there is a huge lack of capacity, mainly at ports of entry – which are the most crucial step in preventing invasions.
Many regions still have to enhance their management plans for effective control of invasive species, starting with identification of common invasive species.
4: There are success stories on the continent – lessons should be shared across borders.
In South Africa, the management of alien plant invasions has been actively supported by the government’s Working for Water programme since 1995.
Read more: Invasive alien plants in South Africa pose huge risks, but they can be stopped
A study in 2022 estimated that an average of R310 million (adjusted to 2020 values) had been spent every year on work that covered 2.7 million hectares across more than 76,000 sites. This doesn’t mean plant invasions are totally under control. But it is clear that, without this kind of programme, the situation would be far worse.
The study recommended that the programme’s future efforts must focus on clearly defined priority sites, improving planning and monitoring, and increasing operational efficiency. These are all valuable lessons for other African countries.
An African lens
Its new report did not focus on any one part of the world, but IPBES has previously been clear about the importance of biodiversity to African nations. In a 2018 regional assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services For Africa, the organisation wrote that
biodiversity and nature’s contributions in Africa are economically, socially and culturally important, essential in providing the continent’s food, water, energy, health and secure livelihood, and represent a strategic asset for sustainable development and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Most of the data in the newest report comes from the northern hemisphere, as this is where most of the research is conducted, and where the majority of funding comes from.
Different countries and regions will have different needs. That’s where the value of regional coordination and knowledge-sharing becomes clear.",Invasive alien species are a serious threat to the planet: 4 key messages for Africa,environment + energy
"As our planet warms, we’re experiencing more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, prolonged droughts and altered ecosystems. These environmental shifts directly affect people’s livelihoods by destroying crops and depleting water sources. They make once-inhabitable areas uninhabitable.
In response to these challenges, many individuals and communities have no choice but to abandon their homes and seek safety elsewhere. The vast majority will remain within their country borders – it’s predicted that by 2050 up to 86 million Africans will migrate within their own countries due to weather shocks. But some will cross borders, triggering the need for international protection.
The challenge, however, is that people crossing borders due to weather don’t qualify as refugees under key laws and conventions. This displacement could be due to sudden-onset events, such as volcanic eruptions or flooding, which may pose an immediate threat to life. Or it could be due to slow-onset events, such as desertification or rising sea levels, which may eventually make life untenable.
It’s hard to say exactly how many people this affects because it’s a complex topic. However, we do know that cross-border migration affects tens of thousands of people every year. For instance drought conditions in 2022, exacerbated by political insecurity and instability, forced at least 180,000 refugees from Somalia and South Sudan into parts of Kenya and Ethiopia.
It’s predicted that the number of people displaced due to weather shifts or disasters will reach as many as 1.2 million people by 2050. This figure will depend on how changes in the climate unfold.

Without refugee status, those forced to move across borders due to weather events may not receive valuable support. Depending on the individual country, support can include the right to live and work, access to health or education services and the right to move freely.
I study the legal protection of asylum seekers, refugees, migrants and internally displaced people in Africa. I recommend that international laws and conventions be amended to explicitly include people forced by weather shocks to move across borders. They need full refugee protection.
Lack of protection
A variety of laws ensure refugees’ basic human rights are protected. The core of “refugee law” is constituted by the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention – a United Nations multilateral treaty that defines who a refugee is – and its 1967 New York Protocol. Refugees in Africa are also protected by the 1969 Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Convention.
These laws provide them with a safe haven, access to fair asylum procedures and protection from discrimination. The domestic laws of many African countries incorporate these international principles. This offers legal safeguards and support to refugees, helping them seek safety and rebuild their lives.
As I mention in a recent study, the challenge with the Refugee Convention is that it rules out people who are “victims of famine or natural disaster” unless they also have a “well‑founded fear of persecution”. For instance, people fleeing Ethiopia between 1983 and 1985 due to drought would be considered refugees because they also feared persecution by the Mengistu Haile Mariam-led military dictatorship (Derg) which was deliberately restricting food supplies in parts of the country.
The United Nations agency mandated to aid and protect refugees, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR), follows the definition provided by the Refugee Convention. As does the Global Compact on Refugees, a UN-driven blueprint for governments, international organisations and other stakeholders.
This means that people forcibly displaced only by environmental disasters are not entitled to refugee status, although deserving of temporary protection.
Within Africa, there’s a debate about whether the 1969 Organisation for the African Unity (OAU) Refugee Convention originally included people displaced by natural disasters in its definition of “refugees”. Some practitioners believe it does, though this stance appears limited to human-made disasters.
When it comes to domestic laws, as of now, there’s no African country that recognises people fleeing natural disasters as a “refugee”.
There is, however, some movement. People fleeing environmental disasters are increasingly being recognised by international organisations.
For instance, UNHCR recognises them as a vulnerable category of persons to be protected. It has raised awareness of climate change as a driver of displacement and the need to address protection for people displaced in the context of disasters. UNHCR is also working on addressing legal gaps related to cross-border disaster-displacement.
But there’s still more to be done.
What needs to change
People displaced by adverse weather developments should be given more than temporary protection. This will require changes to international regulations and national laws.
For instance, a protocol regarding climate-induced displacement should be added to the 1969 OAU convention so that displaced people who cross international borders are legally covered.","Environmental disasters and climate change force people to cross borders, but they’re not recognised as refugees – they should be",environment + energy
"“On the other bank … that is where Henri Lopes now rests,” wrote novelist and journalist Nicolas Michel in a beautiful tribute to mark the passing of the celebrated Congolese author. It’s a reference, of course, to Lopes’ 1992 novel Sur l'autre Rive (On the Other Bank).
Indeed, how can we not imagine Lopes as the character Andélé from his 1990 novel Le Chercheur d’Afriques (The Researcher of Africa), who describes himself as a man “born between the waters”. Lopes, born to mixed ancestry, was a writer who never wanted to be confined on one “bank”. His novels depicted a broad and inclusive range of characters.
Identity is a key theme in his work, as is colonisation, its after-effects, and the politics of postcolonial Africa. The novels, driven by a quest for social justice, include meditations on women’s rights, dictatorial regimes, racism and a questioning of certain ancestral traditions. It’s not surprising they are political in nature. Lopes was a teacher turned politician who served as prime minister of Congo-Brazzaville.
As a lecturer and scholar of Francophone African literature I focus here on his literary career.
Through his writing Lopes explored the multiple ethnicities that forged his identity. In the process his novels offer insights into how humans from different worlds interact. He dares to show that prejudices and racism are a trait shared by all human beings.
Who was Henri Lopes?
Born Marie-Joseph Henri Lopes in 1937 in Léopoldville (today Kinshasa) in what was then the Belgian Congo, Lopes grew up in Brazzaville across the Congo River. His parents were reportedly both mixed race and abandoned by their European fathers at birth.
The Researcher of Africa is a testimony to the multiple identities of those not considered to be of one pure racial group. Andélé finds himself variously labelled: black, half-black, half-white, Indian, Arab, Jewish, West Indian… Lopes, too, was a cultural kaleidoscope. He never belonged to one river bank but rather embarked on boats which sailed between the two.
Lopes started his career as a teacher but would go on to enter politics, finding an affiliation with President Marien Ngouabi’s left-wing Marxist-Leninist regime. Between 1973 and 1975 Lopes served as prime minister under the fourth president of the Republic of the Congo. A high level position beckoned at Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. In the 1980s and 1990s, Lopes served as deputy director for Africa. In 1998 he was appointed Congo’s ambassador to France. He would serve in the position for 17 years.
But he is best remembered as a writer of fiction.
The literary work
His literary debut Tribaliques (Tribaliks: Contemporary Congolese Stories) was a collection of short stories. Like that of many of his peers, the work focused on themes of tribalism, postcolonial African politics and social injustice. Tribaliques received the Grand Prix Littéraire d'Afrique Noire in 1972.
Readers International
He would go on to publish a dozen works of fiction between 1972 and 2012. The best known of these is the 1982 political satire Le Pleurer-rire (The Laughing Cry). The novel is drenched with witty and barbed insights into the character of postcolonial African politicians. The Researcher of Africa remains one of Lopes’ most studied books.
In 2012 Une Enfant de Poto-Poto (A Child of Poto-Poto) was awarded the Porte Dorée Literary Prize. In 1993 Lopes received the Grand Prix de la Francophonie of the Académie Française for his entire body of work.
The reader of his works will discover honest black men as well as corrupt politicians and dictators. In his analysis of The Laughing Cry, literary scholar Alphonse Dorien Makosso writes that the novel bears “testament to the act of using literature to address socio-historical issues that border on state terrorism, dictatorship and political corruption”. According to Togolese writer Sami Tchak:
The author of The Laughing Cry leaves us, through all his books, a laughter that will always question us.
While Lopes portrays despicable colonisers he also offers white characters who view Africa not as a barbaric place without history, but as a continent endowed with civilisation long before the arrival of westerners.
They will also find many endearing female figures there, whose honour and freedom he defended. Whether they are mothers or sex workers or women who are stigmatised for being sterile, they occupy an important place in the literary production of Henri Lopes.
Legacy
Reading Lopes also means delving into Congolese culture. Fellow countryman and novelist Alain Mabanckou stated that Lopes was admired for “his pen crossed by a caustic irony, his fine humour and his introspection of Congolese morals”.
Congolese customs are revealed in French but interspersed with expressions taken from the languages spoken in Congo. In an interview with Mauritian poet and critic Édouard Maunick Lopes said:
When I write a novel, I am not ideological. I am not looking for my place in African literature. At the start I pause, and I say that I am going to speak Congolese, that I am going to speak Congolese in French, writing in this borrowed language that I love.
Even while affirming his Congolese identity, he refused to be confined to an exclusive “bank”. Lopes wanted to write for everyone, and he succeeded. He found a style that married multiple languages and rhythms to represent the diversity of humanity.
In his own words:
We must not be afraid to describe ourselves, even with our faults.
Lopes has not left; he will live on through his writing. Whatever “other bank” he is resting on, one can be sure that he has joined the beloved spirits of Senegalese author and diplomat Birago Diop’s poem The Dead Are Not Dead. With them, Lopes navigates the planets and galaxies, embracing the multiple races and human identities he had been assigned throughout his life.","Henri Lopes, the prime minister of Congo who became a famous novelist: behind the power of his writing",arts + culture
"The history of South Africa’s struggle against apartheid (separatist white minority rule) is taught only through the broadest of brushstrokes in the country’s schools. So might music be a way to bring the story of one anti-apartheid activist alive for a new generation? And when that activist is a Black gay man, Simon Nkoli (1957-1998), how do you reclaim his story from the stereotypes all of those labels potentially carry?
Those were the challenges facing South African composer Philip Miller when he began work on what became Nkoli: The Vogue Opera, on at The Market Theatre in Johannesburg. As part of my ongoing research into South African music, I interviewed Miller and members of the company about how Nkoli came to the stage.
Why the musical matters
The story was personally and politically important to Miller, who knew Nkoli:
We’d be at the Skyline; Simon would have a dance, have fun – and also be an Aids activist, talking to people about condoms.
(Skyline was a gay bar in downtown Johannesburg that drew a racially mixed clientele during apartheid.) Miller was horrified that someone who had played a vital role in gay rights being enshrined in the South African constitution – the first African nation to do so – was, today, so little known.
Nkoli also co-founded Johannesburg Pride, the first pride march in Africa. “That knowledge,” says Miller, “can be revolutionary and inspirational for today’s collective struggles too.” It prompts a re-think of the individualism sometimes attached to identity issues.
Dancer Lwanele Masiza. Mark Lewis/Nkoli: The Vogue Opera
Miller’s first thought was an opera – “but most young people wouldn’t dream of going to the opera!” He considered a score incorporating disco and the South African pop of the era, which Nkoli loved (as his letters from prison revealed). Nkoli had been imprisoned alongside 11 other activists after the Delmas Treason Trial and came out as gay in prison, forcing the liberation movement to acknowledge queers and influencing the freedoms later enshrined in the constitution. Miller also considered rap – “which in some ways serves the same function as operatic recitative, but more interestingly”.
Choral protest songs – a key sonic component of Nkoli’s time in the leadership of Cosas, the anti-apartheid Congress of South African Students – also had to be heard.
Vogueing meets opera
Then Miller looked at the African-American queer tradition of vogueing (a stylised queer dance display adopting and subverting catwalk model poses) with a soundtrack rooted in disco but more electronic, with beats kicking harder. South Africa’s LGBTIQ+ community had a similar tradition in beauty pageants such as Miss Glow Vaal, which Nkoli had helped organise. TV shows like RuPaul’s Drag Race, plus the use of vogueing by artists such as US pop star Beyoncé in her Renaissance tour, mean the format’s appeal now extends to young South Africans of all identities. But the score Miller created from those diverse inspirations had to be synthesis, not pastiche.
Composer Philip Miller. Mark Lewis/Nkoli: The Vogue Opera
A team came together, including many longtime Miller collaborators and, eventually, a full 26-member theatre ensemble, many youthful and drawn from the LGBTQI+ community. They include South African rap lyricist Gyre and UK guest Rikki Beadle-Blair as director and dramaturge. Beadle-Blair is a performer, director and award-winning playwright, as well as a queer rights and health activist and the host of UK vogueing balls.
But even more mature cast members, such as Bongani Kubheka (playing Delmas trialist Gcina Malindi, who defended Nkoli from gender-based harassment in jail) came to the script knowing very little of Nkoli’s story. He says:
I didn’t even know there was a queer activist in the struggle! It’s certainly broadened my perspectives on our history.
Long walk to stage
The project began as a 2020 workshopped production first titled GLOW (after the Gay and Lesbian Organisation of the Witwatersrand), shaped by a collective process and careful listening to many who had known and worked with Nkoli. These included Beverly Ditsie, former Constitutional Court judge Edwin Cameron, Nkoli’s defence lawyer Caroline Heaton-Nicholls and Nkoli’s mother, Elizabeth Nkoli.
Singer Ann Masina. Mark Lewis/Nkoli: The Vogue Opera
Consultation reinforced an acute awareness of the responsibility the production carried. “Even the protest songs were very carefully chosen,” says Miller. “We use Yindlela (Inde Yendlela), which had been appropriated by (former president) Jacob Zuma. We re-appropriate it back. The lyrics allude to the long walk to freedom, and underline that a) we haven’t got there yet; b) nobody told us it’d take so long, and c) LGBTIQ+ people have the right to ‘sissy that walk’!”
Miller recalls “massive debates” in the team about every aspect of the show. He’s not, he says, creating hagiography, and from the conversations with Ditsie came an honest representation of the blind spots that even men like Nkoli had about women’s struggles. The conversations with Elizabeth also created what cast members experience as one of the most moving arias, when singer Ann Masina, playing Elizabeth, recalls her hopes and fears for her son, and reflects that despite his role, she still lives in Sebokeng, dependent on a government grant.
Masina says the song sometimes makes her sob. She deals with those emotions during rehearsals “so I can bring the power but not the breaking-down to the stage”.
The importance of joy
There’s joy in the music, too: music director Tshegofatso Moeng confesses to “some moments when I just want to stop conducting and dance!”

And for Miller, that joy is vital. Vogueing’s assertions of joy and excellence, he says, defy repressive straight sensibilities and are part of its revolutionary potential. “Vogueing’s display categories declare: 'I can be anybody I want to be’. But I’ve created some music that deliberately crashes against that ‘walking the runway’, to create a subversive tension.” One song declares: “Coming out is not a Diana Ross song.”

"When Professor Henry Charles “Jatti” Bredekamp began his career as a historian of early Cape Town in South Africa, there was still a commonly held myth that the region’s native people, the Khoisan, had “all but disappeared”. This was in the wake of slavery, colonialism and apartheid, a system of racial segregation by white minority rule.
Bredekamp, who passed away in September 2023, was central in debunking this myth. Aside from his scholarship, he will be remembered for his influential role as a public historian and a conduit for the revival of Khoisan indigenous identity. Many within the movement fondly refer to him as the father of Khoisan revivalism.
Read more: Rock art: how South Africa's coat of arms got to feature an ancient San painting
I interviewed Bredekamp and other “Khoisan revivalists” over several years for my book Khoisan Consciousness. I believe that Bredekamp’s fascinating life story continues to speak to the present moment, when people are proudly identifying as Khoisan and demanding historical justice after being suppressed for centuries.
In fact, Khoisan revivalism’s origins, driving forces and tribulations simply cannot be understood without taking into account Bredekamp’s living legacy: moving conversations on Khoisan history and identity out of the ivory tower of the academy and onto the streets.
Who was Henry Bredekamp?
Bredekamp (born in 1945) served as chief executive of the Iziko Museums of Cape Town, president of the South African national committee of the International Council of Museums and interim chief executive of Robben Island Museum.
He was the first academic historian of colour to be employed by a South African university. In 1976 he left his job as a farm school teacher in the Great Karoo and accepted a position as lecturer-researcher at the University of the Western Cape.
Born and raised in Genadendal, a mission station originally aimed at converting the local Khoisan, Bredekamp had always been aware of his indigenous heritage. He began to assert this lineage more prominently as he established himself in academia.
He went against the current by focusing his research on the Khoisan’s resistance to, and mistreatment by, the colonial oppressors. He steered his career towards public history and spreading awareness about Khoisan history.
A decisive moment occurred during a Khoisan Studies conference in Germany in 1994. Realising he was the only African delegate, Bredekamp made a heartfelt plea to the audience to “recover our past and our traditions”. In essence, he was exploring the possibilities of a collaboration between activism and academia that would kickstart Khoisan revivalism.
The big picture
To understand Khoisan revivalism, one has to back up several centuries. As Europeans settled on South African shores in the mid-1600s, the local Khoisan (also known as Khoi and San) were violently dispossessed of the land they had been living on for centuries. Those who did not perish in their resistance were forcefully assimilated into colonial society. They were made to renounce their indigenous cultures, languages and belief systems. They had to give up their traditional hunter-gatherer and cattle-herding modes of subsistence.
The Khoisan were eventually classified as “Coloured” under the apartheid system of the 1900s. The label described those of mixed “racial” origins and fitted between “White” and “Black” in the racial hierarchy. As a result, most South Africans believed the Khoisan had disappeared, except for a few “pure” communities in the Kalahari Desert.
This “extinction discourse” has especially been challenged since apartheid’s demise in the 1990s. Increasing numbers of people once again proudly call themselves Khoisan, particularly in urban areas.
Khoisan revivalism
Examples of Khoisan revivalism abound in South Africa today. It can be seen in activists occupying ancestral land in Grabouw. In the fight against property development on what some Khoisan revivalists claim is sacred land. In the landmark benefit-sharing agreement recognising Rooibos (a plant famous as a tea) as Khoisan traditional knowledge.

But when did the movement begin? I started looking for answers about a decade ago, focusing on the perspectives of the Khoisan revivalists themselves. Why did they turn to Khoisan identity and what did they hope to achieve?
Khoisan revivalists are a diverse group. There are longstanding disputes over leadership positions, political strategy and the boundaries of Khoisan identity. However, they all arguably seek to instil a sense of pride and ownership among those who once again identify as Khoisan. These core values were articulated by the earliest Khoisan revivalists, not least Bredekamp.
Bredekamp’s influence
Bredekamp was the main organiser of the 1997 Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage Conference in Cape Town. It was distinct from earlier versions because of its active recruitment of Khoisan participants. They brought their grievances and calls for indigenous rights directly to the audience. Bredekamp hailed this as the beginning of a battle for identity. He ensured that the follow-up edition produced concrete policy recommendations.
However, he soon become disheartened by what he regarded as the rise of self-proclaimed Khoisan “chiefs” who didn’t provide solid historical evidence to back up their claims. Some were unscrupulously looking to enrich themselves. Relaying these concerns to the South African government in his consultancy work, Bredekamp insisted that all claims for recognition as Khoisan traditional leaders be thoroughly vetted. He also somewhat surprisingly advised against granting the Khoisan statutory recognition as indigenous people, a contentious issue to this day. As far as Bredekamp was concerned, many had turned the Khoisan revivalist movement into a charade, divorced from its original emphasis on heritage, culture and language.
Considering the bold claims made by some Khoisan leaders, Bredekamp’s concerns remain pertinent. He insisted on historical criticism, while remaining attentive to the plight of a people he understood intimately.
Tensions surrounding decolonisation also remain as relevant as they were in 1997. Some of those Bredekamp influenced actively, such as South African academics June Bam or Yvette Abrahams, seek to include grassroots movements in academia. Taking history to the people and the people to history seems to be Bredekamp’s most enduring legacy.",Henry Bredekamp and the Khoisan: the living legacy of a renowned South African historian,arts + culture
"Leading politicians in the UK, including the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, are of African Indian descent. Other high profile examples include the country’s two most recent home secretaries – Priti Patel, who served from 2019 to 2022, and her successor Suella Braverman, whose tenure ended abruptly on 13 November when she was fired by Sunak.
The home secretary is responsible for law enforcement in England and Wales, national security and immigration.
Sunak’s grandparents left the Punjab in northern India for east Africa in the 1930s. His mother was born in Tanzania and his father in Kenya.
Patel’s parents were immigrants from Uganda; she was born in the UK and cherishes her “deeply held British values.”
Braverman, too, was born in Britain. Her mother grew up in Mauritius, a former French colony, and her father is of Kenyan Indian origin. Braverman calls herself “a child of the British Empire”.
All three are part of the African Indian diaspora. Do they tell us anything about the cohort of people who have had the same experiences as the children of migrants and as part of a diaspora?
I have researched the Indian and African diasporas and found that, in fact, members of diasporas have supple and dynamic political positions. Sunak, Braverman and Patel, among others, provide real life examples of how diasporic people exhibit a wide range of political affiliations, outlooks and opinions.
Some researchers used to believe that diasporic and immigrant communities would function as a “unified polity” – they might all vote the same way. This thinking holds true for many whose work focuses on diasporas and politics – but for those, like me, who research diasporas and migration, there’s been a shift in the last decade or so towards more complex understandings. My research is qualitative, allowing me to delve more deeply into the complexity and idiosyncrasy of diasporic communities.
Diasporas on the move
An African Indian is a member of the Indian diaspora whose family is or has recently been Africa-based.

In the early 1970s, former Ugandan president Idi Amin implemented several hostile, xenophobic policies. In 1972 he ordered all Indian Ugandans to leave the country. Many East African Indians, including those from Tanzania and Kenya, emigrated because of open discrimination against them, heading to countries like Canada and the UK in greater numbers.
It wasn’t just Amin who drove those of Indian descent from the continent. Throughout the 20th century, and especially after the second world war, Britain’s colonial subjects started arriving in the UK. In prior centuries, British imperialism and settler colonialism also spurred many waves of migration, including some of those of the African Indian diaspora.
A diasporic group lives in a geographical location other than their original homeland. Researchers have long been interested in whether members of ethnic or religious diasporas would act as a bloc of unified political actors in influencing their homeland politics or the political climate in their new adoptive countries.
Dynamic, discursive identity
Researchers have highlighted how diasporas can “rediasporise” as children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren move to new locations. Members of diasporas may choose to identify with multiple homelands and host countries over time.
But they may choose to identify with one more than the other or do something else entirely. Take Braverman: although a member of the Indian and African diasporas, she has been outspoken about tightening the UK’s immigration policy. She’s on record as having said:
Look at migration in this country – the largest group of people who overstay are Indian migrants.
Expecting her to have an automatic affiliation with her past isn’t reasonable. Recent scholarly work on diasporic identity has sought to understand identity not as static and “essentialist” but dynamic and discursive. It is also co-constructed, created as an interplay between the individual and the structures – of race, ethnicity, religion, national context and so on – in which she finds herself.

Real-life examples like those of Patel, Braverman and Sunak can help diaspora scholars like myself sharpen our analysis of diasporic communities. As scholars, we cannot presume to know how members of diasporas will identify themselves and what their politics will be without doing extensive research. This will build a better understanding of the complex ways that diasporic communities will contribute to society in their new homes.
All we can say for sure is that diasporic identities and identifications are fluid, mobile and creative. Diasporic people cannot be pigeon-holed or put in a box.",India to Africa to the UK: Diasporas don’t influence politics in predictable ways,arts + culture
"“One-chance” is the name Nigerians use for a form of robbery that takes place in both public and private vehicles when people accept the offer of a ride. It is an organised crime, perpetrated by people who work together, using a strategy of hailing passengers into their waiting vehicle. They capitalise on the transport needs of passengers, especially during rush hours in the morning and the evenings. In Lagos, an estimated eight million commuters and five million vehicles use the roads and bridges connecting the mainland and island.
At rush hours Lagos is jam-packed. An average of 264 cars per kilometre negotiate the city compared to the world average of 11 cars per kilometre. This encourages commuters to use private vehicles, known locally as kabukabu, which pick up passengers randomly. The vehicles fill up faster than vehicles at designated stops, which makes them attractive to commuters in a rush. They are usually cheaper too.
Once passengers are inside their vehicle, the one-chance gang members instruct victims to comply, using coercion and violence. They take the victims’ possessions and may hurt them physically and traumatise them emotionally. Passengers are sometimes thrown off a speeding vehicle. There have even been cases of victims being killed.
Residents of Lagos dread being victims of one-chance. Official statistics are hard to come by, but media reportage most likely increases the fear of the crime. The Lagos state government in 2022 listed it as a crime of major concern.
Public transport safety is a field of study worldwide, but one-chance public transport criminality in Lagos, Nigeria has not received much attention. This is why we studied how the criminals operate and what their victims experience. We also looked at the social situations which facilitate the crime and commuters’ awareness of safety in the Lagos State transport corridor.
Understanding the strategies and victimisation experiences may be a first step towards prevention and an appropriate institutional response. For example, the law enforcement authorities could map one-chance crime hot-spots. Commuters could make some changes to their behaviour too.
Our study
In our study we administered in-depth interviews to 10 people who had been victims of one-chance robberies. They came from different walks of life; six were men and four were women, ranging in age from 25 to 65.
Our questions probed into issues of routine, methods of operation, timing of operations, and victimisation experience, among others. We wanted to distil the strategies and tricks deployed in trapping commuters.
The findings showed that similar techniques were used in most cases. Timing was important. Many of the cases reported by our participants happened around 9pm to 11.30pm. Very few happened during the day or early in the morning between 4am and 6am. Each operation lasted from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on what targets had to offer the gang.
Most of the participants were either returning home from their workplaces or going somewhere for a visit or a meeting when they were picked up at bus stops. Others were picked up at the roadside and not from designated places. This put them at greater risk although they may have hoped to pay less for a ride. Vehicles that pick up passengers at undesignated spots usually charge a lower fare.
Different types of vehicles and buses, both Lagos yellow buses and private buses and cars, are used for one-chance. Inside the bus, gang members take up seats in such a way that the victim is forced to sit where he or she can easily be robbed.
Sometimes the criminals were dressed to look like office workers, and included women among them, so that a passenger would feel safer boarding.
Participants reported two types of experience: physical violence and loss of valuables. Some reported being traumatised after the incident. In many of the cases, the attack took place within 5 to 15 minutes of the pickup but might last for up to an hour. We think this could be so that the robbers could act before the situation got suspicious or plans were disrupted.
Victims’ coping strategies
Victims have found ways to cope with the experience or reduce the prospect of it happening again.
Some said they were always very observant and followed their instincts when boarding a vehicle. Some had resolved to hail a private taxi if they worked late in the office or to rely on their colleagues or bosses to drop them at a convenient point. Others would sleep in the office. Some put their faith in God to get them safely home.

The way forward
In planning urban transport safety, the Lagos State government needs to constantly inform the public of dangerous places and where not to board public transportation.
Installation of closed circuit cameras in crime hot-spots with regular security patrols would reduce the opportunity for one-chance criminality.
Commuters could also alter their routines so as to be less predictable. This might reduce the chances of becoming victims.
Commuters should use designated motor parks where commercial vehicles are registered to operate.

"First staged in 2015, the globally touted Nyege Nyege Festival in Uganda is an annual four-day dance party featuring hundreds of deejays. It’s also a major tourism drawcard that caters to 15,000-odd lovers of electronic dance music. However, Nyege Nyege is most often in the headlines for creating controversy. Last year the event, the first after a three-year break due to COVID-19, nearly didn’t happen. Uganda’s parliament banned it – and not for the first time – on the grounds that it promoted “sexual immorality”. Eventually the prime minister gave it the go-ahead. This year the festival, being held at a new venue, has faced controversy over the threat of terrorist attacks. Tourism lecturer Amos Ochieng has studied the festival and explains its ongoing dilemmas.
Why is the event in the headlines this year?
There were terror threat warnings just a few days before the opening of this year’s festival. Considering that a sizeable number of event goers come from abroad, the US warned its citizens to avoid crowded places, including this year’s event. The UK also issued a warning.
Reports have speculated there is to be strengthened security at the event. Interestingly, however, moral outrage about the festival from Ugandan leaders has not been an issue this year.
Why did it change venues again this year?
The event was moved into Jinja city (it was previously 30-40km outside the city) on the shores of Lake Victoria for several reasons. The new venue can accommodate larger crowds, which will generate more revenue for all stakeholders. It’s also more convenient in that it’s closer to the city centre, with more accommodation options, and it offers other attractions and activities in the area – such as sport, cruises and bird watching.
Why has Nyege Nyege been so controversial in the past?
The festival promotes electronic dance music and was established by promoters Arlen Dilsizian and Derek Debru to meet the demand among young Ugandans for all-night dance partying. Even though Nyege Nyege promoted the theme of environmental conservation and inclusivity last year, it was the subject of moral outrage and heated debate. The controversy has a lot to do with its name – Nyege Nyege.
In the Luganda language of Uganda, “nyege nyege” is interpreted as an irresistible urge to dance. One dictionary defnition says it means “an intensive feeling for the urgency in need for intimacy, closure and physical exploration”. However, in the Kiswahili language of the larger region, “nyege nyege” is slang for “horny, horny” and is used in relation to sexual urges. As a contemporary and popular musical event, Nyege Nyege is, according to one study, intended to “create intense and affective aesthetic experiences for its participants”.
During a parliamentary session last year a member of parliament ardently argued for its cancellation. Parliamentarians, religious and opinion leaders, human rights activists and some government officials publicly questioned the integrity of the event for being a potential breeding ground for sexual immorality. The Speaker of the Ugandan parliament declared it banned just over a week before it was to be held.
Controversially, in just less than 24 hours, an emergency meeting chaired by the prime minister cleared the event to take place. She argued that it was too late to cancel as thousands of tourists were expected for the festival. A banning would cause financial losses. She assured the public that the event would take place under strict guidelines, including no underage guests and no nudity.
The roots of the resistance to the festival lie in the fact that Uganda is a conservative country with a strong position of Christian morality and a wish to preserve “traditional values”. Homosexuality, for example, is outlawed in the country under increasingly strict laws.
In 2018, the Nyege Nyege Festival was cancelled by Uganda’s ethics and integrity minister on moral grounds but was later cleared to continue. This could be seen as part of government’s commitment to turn Ugandan music and local entertainment into economic goods forming a core part of the creative tourism industry segment. After all, the production of specialised music has a cohesive role in creating local identities and touristic images and products. These can be promoted and marketed to diversify Uganda’s tourism product base.
There is an urgent need for Uganda to develop regulatory guidelines instead of being reactionary.
What role does the festival play for tourism?
Music and dance are a growing part of the creative tourism industry. Like other festivals and cultural displays they are part of the everyday spaces of leisure, a source of artistic expression and audience pleasure.
Allowing Nyege Nyege to continue reflects Uganda’s preparedness to handle large numbers of tourists. The event will provide opportunities for the sale of locally produced materials for improved local livelihoods. As an opportunity for cross-cultural interactions, Ugandan cultures could feature prominently.
The electronic dance music community is a new niche with enthusiastic promoters recruiting new members to build a like-minded community. This community boasts diverse audiences with diverse artistic tastes and consists of smaller (local, translocal or virtual) groups of musicians, fans, promoters and the like. So the festival is a growing leisure activity in Uganda with a moral dilemma.
What is the future for an event like Nyege Nyege?
Uganda, with its strong religious and cultural foundation, will continue to challenge the promotion of Nyege Nyege.
Local music articulates issues around identity, conformity, performance, status, community, subculture, high culture, technology, power relations, education, place and space. How best can all these aspects be integrated to embrace the electronic dance music community for a sustainable tourism industry in Uganda – while still preserving the sanctity of cultural values?
The government departments and agencies responsible for tourism should work with the organisers to draw the best alternatives to promote and conduct the event, and still preserve our cultures.

"More than a third of migration in sub-Saharan Africa happens within the continent. This mixing of people means that some children have parents of different national origins. Yet not enough is known about the lives of these children: how they form their identity and what impact migration has on them.
The majority of research on second generation African immigrants focuses on understanding their experiences in the global north.
Our research looked at the less studied African context, where the majority of African migration occurs.
We are sociologists who study migration and identity and we have seen that studies tend to take the perspective of the parents in the African context. The voices of the children are missing.
To fill this gap we asked children who have two African-born parents – but from different countries on the continent – about their experiences.
Our aim was to understand how children with binational parentage formed their identity. We wanted to know if they aligned with either or both of their parents’ identities and which individual or structural factors shaped that. This could be useful to know in contexts where ethnic, religious, political and national identities are salient markers of difference and influence people’s lives and opportunities.

We conducted 54 interviews but drew on the experiences of 32 of the research participants for our paper. Their ages ranged from the lower 20s to the lower 60s. Participants came from Ghana, Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia and South Africa. Our sample was middle class and therefore our findings are limited to binational identity among middle class Africans.
A key criterion for participation was that participants should have lived in the African country of one of their parents’ birth or both during their formative years. This is because formative years (from birth up to the end of secondary education) shape who you are. And the experiences you have in a place leave an indelible impression and influence your sense of who you are.
We asked them questions such as: Who are you? What is your identity? Where are you from? How do others perceive you? What relationship do you have with your parents’ home country or home town? To what extent has your identity created opportunities for you and to what extent has it created challenges for you?
Primary and secondary identities
A person’s primary identity is how they see themselves principally. Their secondary identity comes after those core or foundational aspects.
We learnt that the participants’ primary identity was shaped predominantly by the closeness of family ties during their formative years. Family ties were evident in communication, visits and presence at rites of passage.
The case of three sisters whose mother was from Botswana and father from Ghana highlighted the importance of the closeness of family ties for identity formation even among siblings.
Maru, the eldest, was born when her parents were settling into adult life. She was raised by her maternal grandmother in rural Botswana because her parents were trying to find jobs in Gaborone, the capital. She felt a close bond with her maternal grandmother and thought of herself as Kalanga (an ethnic group) with a very weak link to Ghana.
Her two sisters were born almost a decade later in Gaborone and raised by their parents, who had settled into their lives in the capital. They described themselves differently. Seliwe described herself as Ghanaian. When she was growing up, the family spent holidays (sometimes several months) in Ghana and she thoroughly enjoyed those visits. She was close to the Ghanaian side of her family and spent much time during our interview talking about her paternal uncle, who lived in her father’s home town, and the jollof rice at a popular fast-food restaurant in Accra. She identified chiefly as Ghanaian and insisted that identity be recognised, for example by ensuring that her name, which is Ghanaian, be pronounced correctly.
The family plays a crucial role in identity formation. If parents want their children to identify with both sides of the family, they need to ensure that the children spend time with both sides of the family.
Another influence is the extent to which children are accepted by the extended family members. Meghan, who had a Ghanaian father and a Nigerian mother, noted that her mother’s family embraced her far more than the Ghanaian side of the family. Although she was living in Ghana, she barely had any contact with them. She explained, “I find that I relate more to my Nigerian side than the Ghanaian side.”
Fluency in a particular African language was not an important marker of identity for the study participants.
Our study also found that binational individuals drew upon their secondary identity either explicitly to achieve some purpose or implicitly for its intrinsic value.
About half of the sample had drawn on their secondary identity to access something practical, like tertiary education or employment. In simple terms, even if they didn’t feel strongly Nigerian (for example) they might use that identity to get a place at a university.
The other half of the sample drew on their secondary identity for non-essential – more cultural – purposes. Usually this was in making choices about things like food, clothing and music. Another purpose was more personal – such as the name the individual chose to use.
Why the insights are useful
Identities are fluid and people weave in and out of them. If you feel Nigerian at your core then you embrace all aspects of “Nigerianness”, including music, food and so on. If being Nigerian is your secondary identity, you see value in claiming it sometimes even if it is for instrumental reasons.
We found individuals with binational identity were able to shift between their primary and secondary identity quite frequently, sometimes daily.

"Second-ranked South Africa is the only African team to make it to the semi-finals at the 2023 Cricket World Cup. After being banished from the international game in 1970 because of apartheid policies, the country began playing in the tournament in 1992 once democracy was on the cards. Since then South Africa have been semi-finalists often. But what are their chances of winning in 2023 and how does the country’s history live on today? We asked cricket expert Mogammad Sharhidd Taliep five questions.
How have South Africa performed in 2023?
South Africa have performed admirably. Of the eight cricket world cups since 1992, they have reached the semi-finals in four, but have never proceeded to the finals. They “choked” in the crucial stages of their matches and were labelled “chokers”. This is their ninth cup and they are semi-finalists for the fifth time.
What is choking?
Choking is when highly motivated and skilled players deliver sub-optimal (less than ideal) performances when subjected to pressure. Numerous theories have been proposed, but it’s still unclear why this happens.
“Drive theories” suggest that players may increase their arousal or drive to excel under pressure. However, an excessive or non-optimal state of arousal caused by anxiety can disrupt attention, resulting in poor performances.
Then there are the “attentional theories” rooted in the idea that the brain can only allocate a limited amount of resources to paying attention. Anxiety about a match competes with and disrupts the attention required to execute routine tasks.
Consider the 1999 World Cup semi-final against Australia, where Lance Klusener and Allan Donald were run out, leading to South Africa’s loss. South Africa needed just one run to win off four balls with one wicket in hand and a batsman like Klusener would typically secure that run. The immense pressure resulted in them choking at the most crucial part of the match. A similar situation unfolded in the 2015 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand.
Read more: Women's Cricket World Cup 2022: how South Africa fares on the world stage
But labelling South Africa as the only team that chokes in cricket world cups is unfair. Since 1992, England, despite winning in 2019, had only reached the semi-finals once before that. And their performance this year displayed several instances of underperforming on the big stage. New Zealand, who played in six of the eight World Cup semi-finals since 1992, have never won the tournament.
What must South Africa do to win?
The opposite of choking is to possess “big match temperament”. This is when an individual or team rises to the occasion of a significant match or critical moment. The player takes ownership and often performs beyond expectations. South Africa need to exhibit big match temperament to secure a World Cup title.
This involves meticulous planning, flawless execution, applying consistent pressure and staying one step ahead. Calmness must prevail in height-of-pressure moments, fostering belief in themselves and their preparation. Two quotes from South African Rugby World Cup flyhalf Handré Pollard sum up the mindset needed in those crucial moments:
In those moments you trust your process and the hours you’ve put in.
and
That is what you live for.
In my view, when South African cricketers relish these pressure moments, triumph awaits.
Transformation is a heated issue – how has it shaped the 2023 team?
Transformation in South African sport is a government goal. The Transformation Charter defines it as:
Increased access and opportunities for all South Africans, including women, persons with disabilities, youth, children and the elderly to sport and recreation opportunities; the socio-economic benefits of sport are harnessed; and the constitutional right to sport is recognised.
Transformation of the national cricket team is just a small part of the agenda, but it receives the most media attention. Despite negative publicity, often around the target or quota system, South Africa’s national team has continued to perform well. A series of research papers show that transformation has generally changed the face of South African cricket without compromising performance at a senior and junior provincial level. South Africa has come a long way since 1992 when Omar Henry was the only Cricket World Cup squad member who wasn’t white.
Although there are barriers for the progression of cricketers and the country is still far away from truly transforming the sport, a lot of work has been done by Cricket South Africa at all levels. These successes are often not publicised. For example, about 60 Hub and Regional Performance Centres have been established across the country. These academy-like programmes aim to develop talent from previously disadvantaged communities by providing coaching, mentorship, transport, high level matches and opportunities.
What does it take to make the national team?
I’ll answer that by highlighting eight key factors that shape the pathway to becoming an elite player:
Parental support and mentorship: Parents are the first contact for budding cricketers. It’s essential to educate parents on how to effectively support and nurture their children’s talent.
Early diversification: Recent analysis suggests that world-class athletes engage in a range of physical and sport activities during their early years. This helps develop different muscle groups, movement patterns and anticipation skills. It prevents boredom and reduces the risk of overuse injuries. So playing many different kinds of sports is a benefit.
Dedicated training: It’s important to have the appropriate training. Research indicates that, by the age of 15, elite-level cricket batters had accumulated about 2,000 hours of structured, coach-led training. This is aside from playing in informal settings.
Intrinsic development: Players should have the freedom to develop naturally and this should be emphasised over rigid coaching instructions. Allowing individual styles and techniques to evolve encourages unique talents in both batting and bowling. It makes players less prone to choking.
Fast bowlers’ preservation: Shoulder and back injuries are common among young fast bowlers. They should prioritise preserving their bodies and perfecting their variations rather than consistently bowling at maximum speed. Especially during their growing years.
Physical conditioning and resistance training: Often overlooked at the junior level, strength or weight training from an early age promotes well-rounded physical development.
Mental toughness: Mental toughness and especially resilience have been found to be among the most important psychological skills of elite players. The ability to bounce back from disappointments and poor performances through learning and adjusting techniques and strategies is vital.
Enjoyment and passion: Above all, both the child and the parent should find joy in the sport and foster a genuine love for playing.",Cricket World Cup 2023: what it’ll take for South Africa to win,arts + culture
"The 6.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Morocco’s Atlas mountains on September 8 killed more than 2,000 people and left thousands more homeless. Parts of the old medina in the nearby city of Marrakech, a Unesco world heritage site, were left badly damaged.
In this episode of The Conversation Weekly podcast, two months after the earthquake, we hear why Marrakech and its medina are so important to Islamic heritage – and why some researchers are worried that the expertise of the city’s traditional artisans could be overlooked in the reconstruction.
Nour Eddine Nachaoune was on his moped when the earthquake struck. He didn’t feel anything unusual, but began to see passersby acting strangely. “People were running, then stopping – they seemed disorientated,” he remembers. Nachaoune is an expert in Moroccan heritage at Mohammed V University in Rabat, and lives in Marrakech.
After going to his home in the new part of the city to check his family were alright, he went into Marrakech’s old medina where his office is based, inside his father’s old weaving workshop. Like many of the buildings in the medina, it was badly damaged, with cracks on the walls and the facade. Nachaoune recalls:
The medina which I knew had completely changed. This medina, with its colours and smells, I didn’t recognise it. It was devastated. It had become deadly and threatening. It was a terrible shock which traumatised me for many weeks.
Marrakech’s medina holds major architectural importance for Islamic heritage. It was founded in the 11th century by a dynasty known as the Almoravids and then developed further by their successors, the Almohads. Today, quite a bit of this medieval infrastructure remains in Marrakech’s medina.
“This is because when Morocco was a French protectorate, the French administration who was ruling over Marrakech wanted to preserve that medieval part of the city for their own academic study,” explains Abbey Stockstill, a professor of art history and expert in medieval Islamic art at Southern Methodist University in Texas in the US. She’s spent time living and working in Marrakech as part of her research into the development of the city into a medieval metropolis.
Today, the medina is home to numerous artisan workshops that make the ceramic tiles, carved plaster and intricate woodwork that decorate the city. “Visiting these workshops is incredible, primarily because they’re almost all family run,” Stockstill explains. “Rarely do they have storefronts so advertising is primarily done by word of mouth.”
Like much of the medina, many of these artisan workshops were damaged in the earthquake. The artisans are now waiting impatiently for help from state aid programmes aimed at restoring the daily lives of those affected. But Nachaoune warns that Morocco’s artisans were already in the grip of a structural crisis well before the earthquake hit, because of how heavily they rely on the tourist industry. And now he says they’re not being called upon to help with the reconstruction after the earthquake.
The rarity of artisans specialising in traditional construction techniques has become a major problem in recent years. This specific knowledge is starting to disappear, principally because of the modernisation of the construction process and the lack of training programmes to preserve these essential skills.

"“How come we’ve never heard of this beautiful instrument until now?” This was posted by a first-year college student to my world music course discussion board recently. He voiced what many of his peers probably felt after watching the extraordinary documentary Ballaké Sissoko, Kora Tales.
The film follows Sissoko, a world class musical artist, from his home in Bamako, Mali to a sacred well and baobab tree in The Gambia on the Atlantic coast. In the film, the award-winning Sissoko revisits his childhood homeland and traces the origins of the instrument that became his destiny.
Sissoko is a jeli (called a griot by outsiders) – a hereditary oral historian and musician attached to the ruling class. Like generations before him, he plays the kora, a unique kind of harp that’s indigenous to the western African savannah. It has 21 strings and is played with four fingers. And it can create dazzling, dense musical textures as well as thin shimmering veneers that accompany the delivery of deep oral history. It is one of the most sophisticated handmade musical instruments in the world, both in its musical capabilities and the depth of its tradition.
Ballaké Sissoko: Kora Tales is a beautifully made film that should be seen by everyone interested in African culture and history.
Kora’s global spread
If you haven’t heard of the kora, it’s not for lack of exposure. Dozens and dozens of kora albums have been released since Gambian Jali Nyama Suso’s debut solo album in 1972. The kora has won more Grammy Awards in the World/Global Music category than the sitar. An album featuring the kora with the BBC Symphonic Orchestra was released in 2023. The reach of the kora beyond western Africa is expansive. It can be heard on recordings by musicians across the world.
I first heard the kora on a 1973 album by Gambian Alhaji Bai Konte. It was an early formative experience that put me on the path towards becoming an ethnomusicologist. In the 1980s, Senegalese-American kora player Djimo Kouyate inspired me to study regional differences in kora playing in four neighbouring countries. I wound up in Bamako, living three doors down from Ballaké Sissoko, studying with Sidiki Diabaté (father of Toumani), who lived two doors down. That became the basis of my first book in 2000, Mande Music.
The history
Constructed from a large half calabash, cowhide, thick wooden neck and leather tuning loops and strings (now nylon), the kora is several centuries old. Precursors go back much further.
Sissoko (right) with Fabouly Diébaté in Senegal. Screengrab/Ballaké Sissoko: Kora Tales/Vimeo
It is intimately intertwined with the history of the Mande homeland along the Niger River, slicing through modern-day Mali and Guinea. This chiefdom rose to power in the 1200s when the legendary Sunjata conquered an oppressive king, Soumaoro Kante, with the help of neighbouring allies. Kante owned the primordial bala (also called balafon), a magical xylophone, which was passed on to the jeli (griot) of Sunjata. His name was Balla Faséké Kouyaté and his direct descendants guard that very instrument in a hut in northeastern Guinea.
In 2008 Unesco declared the instrument a site of intangible cultural heritage and today a museum is being constructed on the site. At its height, the Mande empire extended across much of western Africa and its mines supplied most of the gold circulating in Europe. A visit to Mecca by Mande king Mansa Musa in the 1300s secured his reputation as one of the wealthiest people in the history of the world. Migrations westward to the Senegambia region led to the development of a related language and culture, Mandinka.

Just as the bala (Mande xylophone) has origins in Mali in the 1200s, the kora has origins in the Kaabu federation of the Senegambian Mandinka in the 1700s. Traditionally, jelis have the exclusive right to play both of these instruments. Many origin stories of musical instruments in Africa refer to a jinn (genie) first bringing it out. So it is with the kora.
What the film is about
One of my favourite lines in the documentary comes from Sissoko’s aunt Kadiatou Diabaté, herself a jeli:
This person before you, he was born with the kora. The seventh generation of his lineage. Even if you just touch him, out comes the sound of one of the strings.
Travelling by car, Sissoko leaves his capital city Bamako for a voyage of over 1,000km west to the birthplace of the kora on the Gambian coastline. All of this was part of the Mande empire at its height, as far as the northern reaches of the Niger River at Timbuktu. Sissoko stops at Sibi, where Sunjata is said to have united his armies, made pacts and created the governing constitution of what would become the largest empire in Africa.
The cinematography of the countryside, much of it from aerial drones, is magnificent. Passing through southern Senegal, they cross the Casamance River by boat for a visit with kora master Malan Diébaté. This is kora country and a half dozen kora players appear, singing the praises of Sissoko and his lineage.
Malan Diébaté leads a performance in Darsilame, Senegal. Screengrab/Ballaké Sissoko: Kora Tales/Vimeo
They are accompanied by the women in their extended family tapping out a diasporic source of the signature Cuban clave pattern.
Diébaté recounts the supernatural origins of the kora, and Sissoko takes off for that very spot, Sanementereng in The Gambia. In one sense all musical instruments are magical, given the impact they may have on our lives. Widespread oral traditions attribute the origins of the kora to this specific place on the Gambian coast. When Sissoko arrives here towards the end of the documentary, at a sacred well and a baobab tree that marks the spot, it is a moving experience.
Inspiring work
The writers and directors of the film, Lucy Durán and Laurent Benhamou, have done inspiring work in conveying the beauty of the landscape, the depth and humanity of the tradition, and the artistic persona of Sissoko.

Professor of music and former radio presenter Durán has an awesome track record in this part of the world over many decades, from producing early albums by Toumani Diabaté and other Malian artists to Growing Into Music, a pioneering documentary film series laying bare the process of children learning the musical arts of jelis in Mali and Guinea.
Narrated by French-Malian rap star Oxmo Puccino, the documentary takes you deep into one of Africa’s great classical traditions through the eyes of one of its great artists.

"Research shows that people with disabilities have always been largely excluded and marginalised in societies across the world.
Over time, the language used to describe disability has generally become more positive and inclusive. Many activists advocate for the use of “people/persons with disabilities” and not the “handicapped” or “disabled”. But this language remains negative for many Indigenous people around the world. To them the word “disability” is stigmatising because they don’t have such a term in their vocabulary. It’s also a misrepresentation of their traditional beliefs regarding impairments.
In traditional village life, the Xhosa community of AmaBomvane in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa do not see disability in a person. Their rituals do not allow people to discriminate – their worldview is based on collectivism and ubuntu. Ubuntu is an African philosophy that promotes the common good of society and includes humaneness; each person is an integral part of society.
In many other cultures persons with disabilities are seen to differ from the “norm”.
For my PhD in health sciences rehabilitation, I spent three years studying the experiences of people with disabilities when they underwent Xhosa rituals and traditions. I wanted to know how rituals contribute to health and wellbeing.
Read more: Can the philosophy of ubuntu help provide a way to face health crises?
I found that good health and wellbeing relies on rituals, which are the essence of life among the Bomvana people. And that good health is for everybody, including people with disabilities. They cannot be denied health, because everyone is equal. This offers lessons in the inclusion and participation of people with disabilities.
The study
For my study, 50 people were selected for interviews and focus groups from three rural villages – Gusi, Hobeni and Xhora in the district of Elliotdale – with the assistance of chiefs and community members. They included people over the age of 18 with disabilities (who were able to answer questions), indigenous knowledge holders (elders), caregivers and parents of persons with disabilities, traditional birth attendants, traditional healers, a traditional circumcision surgeon and a social worker.

The Bomvana people are associated with the red ochre they use to decorate their faces and the beautiful beaded red blankets worn when attending traditional functions. AmaBomvane have a strong belief system which strengthens cultural continuity, ensuring there will be no lack in leadership to perform rituals and traditions. Their participation in social organisation ensures that traditional knowledge, transmitted orally, is not lost as it moulds the character of the people.
My study focused on three rituals which mark important stages in a person’s life:
Efukwini (behind the door), which provides a sacred space for giving birth in which the mother and infant remain separate from the rest of the household for 10 days to protect the child from evil forces. When the nursing mother is in seclusion, AmaXhosa believe that the child is connected to the ancestors for its protection and recognition as a member of the family, including all people with disabilities.
Intonjane (female initiation rite), marking a girl’s rite of passage to womanhood, performed between her first menstruation and her wedding. The ritual is done for all young women, regardless of whether they are disabled.
Ulwaluko (traditional male circumcision), in which boys learn about acquiring their identity and social responsibility as men. A person with disability belongs to the community and must not be excluded from this ritual. All boys must be taught to become men, regardless of disabilities.
The findings
AmaBomvane treat people with disabilities with dignity and respect within the context of their rituals. If they didn’t, it’s believed, the rituals would be rejected by the ancestors and misfortune would arise. The Bomvana also believe illness can be prevented through performing rituals to the ancestors, who are seen as intermediaries between God and people. The rituals confer health, stability and resilience.
I found that rituals provide a safe space for people with disability by virtue of being inclusive. This encourages respect and compassion.
The Bomvana understanding of disability is also linked to spirituality and traditional knowledge systems. Disability is seen as outside the body:
Disability is like a blanket any other spirit is wearing.
The Bomvana do not see disability as the real person, saying:
The soul is not disabled.
There are, however, also negative attitudes towards persons with disabilities in the broader Bomvana village society outside of the rituals. This, I believe, is a result of colonial influence and western thinking. AmaBomvane told me, for example, that in the old days missionaries were against men going for circumcision. They did not understand the importance of the ritual to the Xhosa. If one is not circumcised, one remains a “boy” and is forbidden from participating in communal decisions and social events.
Talking about these negative attitudes, one traditional healer told me:
Their treatment is very bad in the community. At times they become projects of people they are living with. Their grant money is misused by their carers.
The grant is given by the state to provide for the basic needs of persons with disabilities who are unable to work.
One caregiver said:
They are not supported as they should be. For example, there are these children we are looking after, and when they go home for holidays, we buy them clothes, but when they come back, the clothes … have been taken by siblings that are not disabled.
While in the villages the old values are still respected, I found indications that with changing times and fractured family units, the concept of ubuntu is under threat.
What this means
The AmaBomvane belief in ubuntu – social justice and fairness – could be a model for the inclusion of persons with disabilities and their rights. The Bomvana case could encourage others to embrace a spirituality that supports resilience and stability. It’s a humane way of viewing disability.

This matters because ubuntu contains all the key aspects of South Africa’s constitutional bill of rights that teaches that “all are equal before the law”.

"The number of South African internet users has nearly doubled in the past decade. One 2023 study of 45 developed countries suggests that South Africans even lead the world when it comes to the amount of time spent in front of screens, at 58.2% of the day.
This digital transformation has significant implications for the country’s media. Particularly for newsrooms that want to engage online audiences in a time when news production has evolved towards greater participation of citizens and civil society. More and more, listeners are contributing to media processes.
During protests, for example, news outlets often invite people at the scene to use WhatsApp groups to share firsthand observations, images or videos. These are verified and incorporated into news coverage. (Indeed, WhatsApp emerged as South Africa’s most popular social media platform in 2022.)
This shift is at the heart of our recent broadcast and community media study. We examined two community radio stations – Zibonele FM and Bush Radio – in South Africa’s Western Cape province. We wanted to know how social media platforms like Facebook and X are shaping the way that young people interact with the stations, and how radio is adapting to meet them online.
We found the stations have embraced social media apps and are actively using them to shape content. Young people are increasingly participating in citizen journalism to influence this content.
This could keep community radio relevant – and that matters. South Africa is home to over 290 community radio stations, far outnumbering the 41 commercial and public service stations. Community radio emerged with democracy in South Africa in the 1990s, providing a platform for alternative voices and grassroots organisations. It’s able to address issues often overlooked by mainstream media.
The stations
Zibonele FM and Bush Radio stood out for us. This is because of their youth-focused content, multilingual broadcasts, diverse audience segments and robust use of digital technologies in news production and programming.
Zibonele FM is based in Khayelitsha, a vast township (black residential area) on the outskirts of Cape Town. The station broadcasts mainly in the local Xhosa language.
Bush Radio is one of the country’s oldest and most influential community stations. Founded in 1992, it has played a role in shaping post-apartheid life in Cape Town. Apartheid was a system of white minority rule that suppressed black voices. Bush Radio provided a platform for voices and perspectives that were often marginalised in mainstream media.
June 2023 data puts listenership figures of Zibonele FM at 182,000 a day. Bush Radio attracts 49,000 listeners. The average daily listenership of community stations in the Western Cape is 29,000.
The study
We conducted in-depth interviews with station managers, producers and journalists at these two stations. Alongside this we studied social media posts from the stations’ X and Facebook accounts and we analysed their on-air content.
We wanted to see if social media shaped youth-oriented programming at Zibonele FM and Bush Radio. While the study’s scope remains small, it provides valuable insights into the digital transformation of news production in South African community radio.
Young Zibonele FM and Bush Radio listeners, we found, were actively participating in the news processes at the radio stations. Especially when the stations tailored their news to draw in these communities. A station manager explained:
We’ve gained a lot of followers, showing that people are drawn to the station’s young presenters on social media. Many engage with our live videos and interactive content, validating their active involvement in shaping news production and content direction. This reinforces our roles as central community hubs.
Our data analysis revealed that young audiences on X and Facebook used these platforms to hold journalists accountable, forcing them to reevaluate their reporting. One producer said:
Any mistake leads to immediate corrections. This caution improves our content quality and accuracy, benefiting from feedback from our social media followers.
The participants in our study stressed the importance of WhatsApp voice notes as a feature of social media that enabled greater engagement from youth audiences. Young listeners are actively shaping the content production process by sending questions as voice notes. This shift diminishes the power traditionally held by presenters and producers. One producer elaborated:
When we interview guests, we inform our audiences that we have a question, and they actively engage with it. During interviews, we encourage young people to post voice notes, which the interviewees respond to. This practice enables us to incorporate diverse voices on air, as people often prefer sending voice notes, sometimes in the form of questions.
Our research underscores how Zibonele FM and Bush Radio have empowered young listeners to engage with journalists actively. This allows them to question and challenge news content.
Station managers reported increased engagement on social media, reinforcing the effectiveness of these strategies in expanding reach and enhancing audience participation. Young audiences, for their part, also used social media to hold journalists accountable, fostering a culture of transparency and trust.
Why this matters
The challenges faced by South African community radio, such as limited reach and resources, are well documented.
For a long time academics have observed that journalism is undergoing changes because of social media.
Social media, as seen in our study, can have a significant impact on the future of radio programming and news. It could lead to a dynamic shift towards more interactive and community-driven programming. This would sustain community radio and enhance its role as a vital source of alternative voices, diverse perspectives and local engagement.

"The international art world is celebrating the Ghanaian artist El Anatsui in London. On 9 October, a gigantic installation of three new works – Behind the Red Moon – opened at the Turbine Hall at the prestigious Tate Modern, displaying what Anatsui is most famous for: unique, large scale sculptural hangings.
Read more: El Anatsui creates gigantic artworks from recycled materials - why the world fell in love with him
Behind the Red Moon is the 2023 Hyundai Commission, an annual exhibition where a globally important artist is invited to stage an installation at the gallery. The exhibition also kicked off the annual Frieze Week of art shows in the city staged to coincide with the Frieze Art Fair, a major international art event.
This and another two significant exhibitions by Anatsui are happening simultaneously in London.
Anatsui spent decades teaching sculpture and art education at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka. As an art lecturer in the same department I have followed and taught his work to students for years – as he once taught me. Along with other former students of his, I travelled to London to view Behind the Red Moon.
The Tate installation further cements the already considerable international reputation of the 79-year-old artist, who creates enormous sculptural pieces, normally from wood and recycled materials such as discarded bottle tops. It does so in a way that establishes a powerful conversation about how history is constructed by the coming together of many cultures in a capitalist world.
The Tate show
The opening of Behind the Red Moon was a cosmopolitan event. Many came from all continents to celebrate a master artist whose practice transcends race, generation and materials. Yet the opening night crowd presented an African flavour – the kind you see at very important events in Nigeria.
In an earlier article on Anatsui, I predicted that the artist “will take your breath away by the time he is done overtaking and mesmerising the massive hall”. Expect to be dazzled! Behind the Red Moon is a magical and troubling universe, shimmering with meanings.

The installation, curated by Tate Modern’s Osei Bonsu and Dina Akhmadeeva, is presented in three acts. The works are fashioned out of over three million used, flattened bottle caps woven together with copper coils to give them the visual appearance of fabrics. They resemble kente cloth from Ghana, the woven cloths of the Akwete in Nigeria and lace from the west.
Each of the three works has dual sides and viewers can choose which side to begin with. The three acts depict imaginary scenes that begin with a blood moon and sun and progress to the earth and to a dead and exploited ocean throwing up its beautiful aquatic life.
The three acts
Let me walk you through these staged acts. At the entrance a visitor is greeted by plaques of texts cast in red against black. They contain phrases that serve as a guide to the essence of the work. One, for example, reads: “Each material has its properties, physical and even spiritual.”
Blood moon. Lucy Green/Courtesy Tate
The artist dwells in the urgency of the present and the planet’s crisis by interrogating the past. The works progress from shining yellow to red to browns to blacks. They speak of the interaction between the global north and south as well as conflict, war, insecurity, climate emergencies and questions of human rights.
Act I: The red moon speaks of how capitalism has driven global connections between continents through waters and sails. The title Behind the Red Moon is instantly revealed on the flipside of the red sculpture – which shows a sunny, yellowy landscape.

Act II: Anatsui writes, on a plaque, that he uses “multiple elements to talk about the world: not a world made up of just one culture, but a world shaped by all of us coming together”. Multiple continents hang from the ceiling to reveal a round earth from a particular angle.
Again there is a poetic second meaning: its flipside reveals what looks like a collection of humanoids pulling on the earth, bringing it to its knees through human activities that have brought us misery in the form of climate and humanitarian crises.

Act III: Just beyond that is a work cast in dark shades on one side, dripping right onto the floor and flowing like a black veil. (This became the backdrop for a special performance by master Ghanaian drummer Abass Dodoo and One Drum that enlivened the opening, giving it the feel of an African festival.)
This black sculpture suggests black gold – crude oil, coal and other fossil fuels – extracted from the earth. There’s an urgency here, a call to a transition to renewable sources of energy.

The flipside is magnificence itself, rich gold colours and reds that could be speaking of the opulence of the west or, for that matter, greedy leaders in poor African countries. The ocean is blackened by them, poor and rich co-existing.
With Behind the Red Moon El Anatsui offers a big picture of history and civilisation – and warns of the consequences of capitalist greed. You will struggle not to be awed by the work.

"The work of award-winning Zimbabwe-born sculptor Shepherd Ndudzo is instantly recognisable. Fluid, elongated black bodies and body parts flow from white rock in a typical work. The bodies are dancing or praying, holding hands or reaching out.
These figurative sculptures, carved out of stone (marble and granite) and wood (ironwood), were recently shown along with his abstract wooden sculptures (titled Seed) at the FNB Joburg Art Fair in South Africa by Botswana’s Ora Laopi contemporary art gallery and research project.
The work by the artist (born in 1978) was displayed as a celebration of the sculpture of Botswana, where he lives and works. The show was dedicated to his father, Barnabas Ndudzo, the famed creator of realistic, often life-size sculptures. In a documentary produced by the gallery, Shepherd tells how he was taught to sculpt by his father. He says that his works speak about migration and help tell his family story.

It’s a tale that spans three neighbouring southern African nations, all known for their sculpture – Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. It exposes a history of shared traditions and schools of teaching, of colonial-era gatekeeping and art world wars. It’s this history that informs the research for my PhD thesis on Zimbabwean art.
It’s my view that Shepherd Ndudzo’s work can only be fully appreciated by understanding his transnational story and how it has shaped his life and career, showing how art traditions are invented and reinvented across borders.
Kekana school
His father Barnabas was born in Zimbabwe and attended the Kekana School of Art and Craft in the late 1960s. Early art schools in Zimbabwe were founded and run by white missionaries and expatriates. But the Kekana School was founded by a black artist and teacher. The school was started at St Faith’s Mission near Rusape by South African sculptor Job Patja Kekana in the early 1960s, long before Zimbabwe attained independence in 1980.
Kekana had trained at Grace Dieu Mission Diocesan Training College near Pietersburg (Polokwane). The same institution was attended by Gerard Sekoto and Ernest Mancoba, two of South Africa’s prominent black modernists. (Modernism was an era of experimentation in art from the late 1800s to the mid 1950s. It saw new ideas, new media and the uptake of socio-political concerns.)

Kekana had settled at St Faith’s in 1944 and stayed until he died in 1995, except for the three years (1960-1963) when he attended art college in the UK. When Shepherd enrolled at St Faith’s High School in Zimbabwe in the early 1990s, he briefly met his father’s ageing mentor.
Shepherd mostly learned from assisting and observing his father at work. Like Kekana and all his students, Barnabas mostly carved realistic statues and busts.
Art war
Zimbabwe is famous for its “Shona sculpture” tradition in which artists use handmade tools, patiently carving human and animal forms from serpentinite rocks. UK-born artist, teacher and museum curator Frank McEwen pigeonholed artists from various ethnic backgrounds and different countries – and not just from the Shona people – in a single misnamed cultural basket. Their individual creative styles did not matter.
McEwen was the founding director of the Rhodes National Gallery (National Gallery of Zimbabwe). Although he was celebrated for his efforts at promoting Zimbabwe’s abstract stone sculpture tradition, ensuring that the world accepted it as modern art, his presence was bad for artists who worked with media like wood and were making realistic works, as well as for those stationed at missionary workshops. (Figurative art represents existing objects. Abstract art usually has no real-life visual reference. Realism refers to accurate depictions usually portraying a sitter or model.)
McEwen preferred working with sculptors from the National Gallery School and the Tengenenge workshop until he had a fall-out with its founder, Tom Blomefield. As reported in the press, Blomefield accused McEwen of stealing artists from his stable. Art historian Elizabeth Morton highlighted that when Kekana visited the National Gallery School soon after his return from the UK he was chased away by McEwen, who didn’t want to see him near his students.
Barnabas
With McEwen holding the most powerful position at the nation’s central art institution, artists from Kekana’s school found themselves on the periphery of Zimbabwe’s mainstream art canon. They had to rely on church commissions and teaching jobs. This probably explains why Barnabas briefly found himself conducting “ecumenical workshops” for the Methodist Church in 1970 and 1971. Today the national gallery doesn’t have a single piece of his in its collection.
Courtesy Ora Loapi
Barnabas headed south, finding a home at the Federated Union of Black Artists (Fuba), an academy in Johannesburg. He settled in Botswana in the mid-1990s. He taught art at Gallery Ann and other institutions before moving to Thapong Visual Arts Centre where he continued to mentor emerging artists.
He gained considerable recognition and respect in Botswana. And it’s in Botswana that his son Shepherd continues to sculpt, having moved to the country initially to assist his father.
Shepherd
The younger Ndudzo collects the hardwood he uses from construction sites, especially from trees bulldozed for road construction. He prefers marble from Zambia and Namibia which comes not only in white, but also in various shades of grey and brown. He highlights how citizens of these countries walk across the countryside on this resource, hardly appreciating its importance. The black granite he combines them with is mostly from Zimbabwe.
Courtesy Ora Loapi
Recently, Shepherd took me to his home in Oodi village in Kgatleng district. His vast open yard is his studio – where his artist neighbours tolerate the deafening noise of his sculpture making.
Though he talks about moving away from his father’s realistic style, I still see strong elements of it in his work. The bas-relief carving in the larger works of wood exhibited at the Joburg Art Fair is a good example. It’s a style inherited from Kekana, who “taught his students bas-relief carving, and realism and understanding of the wood grain”.
Thus I see Shepherd Ndudzo as an artist sustaining a legacy emanating from the Kekana school. However, his work oscillates between figuration and abstraction. It’s quite conceptual in that it is about ideas and quite experimental in that it blends different elements. The artist points to the likes of Tapfuma Gutsa as his greatest inspiration. Gutsa transformed Zimbabwe’s stone sculpture tradition, blending stone with various other elements.
Lineage
Shepherd’s decision to dedicate his exhibition to his father and mentor is an important gesture. It highlights the story of a sidelined artist, mostly written out of history, like others from the Kekana school.
Courtesy Ora Loapi
Artists do not make art in complete isolation. Highlighting the lineage Shepherd Ndudzo belongs to helps us understand his practice, choice of materials and aesthetic references.
It’s a lineage that’s transnational in outlook – linking Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe – and his materials are drawn from different countries. This helps us appreciate how artistic practice can feed off art ecosystems across southern African borders.",Shepherd Ndudzo’s celebrated sculptures tell an untold history of southern African art,arts + culture
"Palestine was about to embark on its 2026 men’s Fifa World Cup qualifying campaign when the latest round of Hamas-Israeli conflict broke out, making Palestine’s national football stadium in the Israeli-occupied West Bank potentially unsafe for matches. As a result, the Asian Football Confederation asked the football-loving nation to stage its home matches in a neutral venue. Algeria in north Africa offered to host Palestine’s games and cover its players’ costs. Mahfoud Amara is a specialist in the intersection of sport and politics with a particular research focus on football in the Arab world. We asked him three questions.
What’s the history of Algeria and Palestine’s relationship?
There are parallels between the colonial systems in Algeria and Palestine. Both nations have been under direct military and settlement occupation. In the case of Algeria this was until independence in 1962.
Algeria had a large population of European settlers who confiscated the land of the Arab and Berber population. France legitimised its occupation of Algeria on the basis that there was no such thing as an Algerian nation with a state entity before 1830. Israel’s ideology denies the existence of a Palestinian nation prior to the unilateral announcement of the birth of the state of Israel in 1948.
Algerians used various means to reclaim their independence from France, including armed struggle. The fiercest conflict – from 1954 to 1962 – resulted in independence and a large number of casualties, particularly Algerian. In the 1960s and 1970s, Algeria was considered a pinnacle of revolutionary movements.
The Palestinian nationalist movement was inspired by the Algerian one in its struggle to achieve independence using both political and violent means. Since independence, Algeria has been supportive of the Palestinian cause. Algeria participated in the Arab-Israeli wars, fighting against Israel. Following the Israeli invasion of south Lebanon in 1982, Algeria received Palestinian refugees. So there is a long, shared history.
Radio Free Palestine was broadcast from Algeria until the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. The Oslo Accords aimed to find a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a negotiated two-state solution.
How does their football history unite them?
Both are nations with a great passion for football. The sport brings hope in difficult times and is a vehicle for political expression. Algeria and Palestine are ardent supporters of one another’s national teams. They share historical similarities in creating these teams.
Algerian people, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front or FLN (proclaimed as the representative of the Algerian revolution, similar to the Palestinian Authority in relation to the Palestinian struggle), used all means to amplify Algeria’s cause for independence, including sports. Football played a significant role.
In 1958, a Fifa World Cup year, the FLN ordered all Algerian professional players in Europe – most of them playing in France – to leave their comfortable lives and fame and secretly travel to Tunisia to form the FLN football team. This served to bring the Algerian conflict into the spotlight, especially in metropolitan France. Fifa, the sport’s world governing body, did not recognise the Algerian team. Even so, it played a number of matches with national teams from north Africa and socialist countries to build support for the Algerian cause. The Algerian Football Federation officially joined Fifa in 1964.

The Arab Palestine Sports Federation was founded in 1931 and re-established in 1944. It had 55 athletic clubs affiliated with it. The Nakba (catastrophe) refers to the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. It put a stop to Palestinian national sports and pushed most Palestinians into exile and refugee camps.
After the Oslo Accords of 1993, the Palestinian Football Federation gained affiliation with various international sports federations. This included Fifa in 1998. However, since then, the federation has encountered persistent challenges in establishing a viable national football infrastructure. This is mainly because of the enduring fragmentation of the Palestinian territory and population – spanning the West Bank, Gaza, various refugee camps and the diaspora. In order to safeguard the mobility and travel rights of Palestinian players, the federation has had to adeptly navigate these challenges to play in international competitions.
How does this play out on the football field today?
Algeria is ranked 34 in the world by Fifa and is a leading contender in Africa. Palestine’s team is ranked 97 and has qualified for the Asian Cup of Nations three years in a row. It is a symbol of national unity.
If Algeria were to host Palestine’s training camps and international matches for the 2026 World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup it would mean some stability. Being in Algeria would provide access to infrastructure, football support and – most importantly – a large base of fans. A friendly match between Palestine and Algeria in 2016 gathered thousands of Algerian fans, estimated at 80,000. Many cheered for Palestine. Algeria hosting Palestine in 2023 would be an opportunity to reiterate its support for the Palestinian cause and to leverage its sports diplomacy.

For the Palestinian Football Federation, maintaining a presence in the international football arena will help to promote the rights of Palestinians to practise sports and represent their country.
The sports arena has emerged as an unconventional yet powerful platform for the expression of solidarity with political causes like Palestine’s. This becomes all the more significant when considering the fragmented positions held by Arab states regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While official state positions may differ, the people – particularly Arab players and fans – have often used sports events to fly the Palestinian flag.",Hamas-Israel conflict: Algeria offers to host Palestine’s football matches – the bigger history,arts + culture
"In South Africa, a skhothane is a young, fashionably dressed black urban resident who engages in destructive conspicuous consumption. This involves regular get-togethers on weekends in which groups of izikhothane – most likely male teenagers – gather to compete in mock battles where luxury items are often destroyed. The name is derived from a word in the Zulu language, ukukhotha, meaning “to lick”, but in urban slang it means to boast.
There’s no consensus about when exactly this “youth craze” emerged. But there’s reason to believe the ukukhothana subculture can be traced as far back as 2005, first in the townships of the East Rand of Gauteng province before spreading to other provinces. In South Africa, townships are human settlements established outside towns and cities by the white minority apartheid government as areas for people categorised as black to live in.
At ukukhothana events, izikhothane show up wearing expensive designer labels such as Rossimoda shoes, DMD shirts and Versace jackets and suits. They also bring what, in the township context, is considered expensive junk food, such as KFC and Debonair’s Pizza. Alcohol such as Bisquit, Hennessy and Jameson, traditionally associated with affluent people, accompanies the food.
What makes the events interesting is what happens to these costly items once there’s an audience and loud music. The expensive clothes are at times torn, burnt or trampled on. The food is thrown on the ground and at each other in a playful and boastful manner. The alcohol is both consumed and used to wash hands and even poured on the ground. All this is done in order to show off wealth, style and swag, and ultimately to outdo each other in attracting cheers from the audience, attention from female spectators and respect from rival crews.
As one would expect, a subculture like this in a developing economy like South Africa has not been well received. It’s often criticised as wasteful and reckless by society and in the media. Prominent investigative journalist Debora Patta, for example, labelled izikhothane as “bling gone obscenely mad” on national TV. The question is asked: why do izikhothane embrace conspicuous consumption despite their limited means?
As communications scholars we have each studied this subculture for several years. In a recent research paper we explore the link between consumption and the idea of rehumanisation – or restoring dignity to marginalised lives. We investigate how this subculture is a form of fashion consciousness with a long history – leading on from the “diamondfield dandies” of the 1800s and the “oswenka” of the 1900s. We argue that ukukhothana is a form of expression that has the potential to reclaim a sense of selfhood and pride in the remnants of oppression in post-apartheid South Africa.
Consumption and identity
UK anthropologist Mary Douglas and UK economist Baron Isherwood suggested in 1979 that consumption is a purposeful act. It’s often aimed at conveying identity, cultural values and social circumstances. The goods people consume serve as markers of social identity and carry deeper meanings. US sociologist Thorstein Veblen’s concept of “conspicuous consumption” aptly captures this phenomenon. It refers to the act of displaying wealth and status through ostentatious spending.
Izikhothane’s behaviour can be understood within this framework. It’s an effort to signal their defiance against adversity and assert their presence in a society that has historically marginalised those who look like them. This historical marginalisation involved the treatment of black people as less than human through the system of apartheid. Black people were dehumanised during this period.
Dehumanisation involves viewing others as fundamentally different and inferior, perpetuating stereotypes and hindering empathy. Interestingly, this practice affects both the dehumanised and the dehumaniser. By devaluing others’ humanity, individuals strip themselves of their own humanising qualities. This underscores the complex psychological toll of perpetuating stereotypes.
Reversing the process of dehumanisation and reclaiming humanity is a nuanced effort that happens through a process of rehumanisation. Sartorial expression, which involves using clothing to convey identity, can play a pivotal role in rehumanisation.
Material possessions hold a significant influence over how we view other people’s identities. People use belongings not only to express who they are but to construct their “best” selves.
Diamondfield dandies and oswenka
Izikhothane are not the first and will not be the last to do this. Various sartorial subcultures appear to have arisen under conditions of dehumanisation in South Africa. These include the diamondfields dandies of the 1880s in Kimberley and the oswenka in Jeppestown in Johannesburg in the 1950s. These fashion subcultures found themselves in dehumanising conditions of migrant labour exploitation. They used expensive clothing and competitions of display to carve out a sense of their own humanity.
The diamondfield dandies sought to challenge racially inscribed stereotypes by parading in expensive clothing. They rebelled against the silence of black people in a bigoted white culture and created an identity outside work.
Read more: Sho Madjozi: the pop star using traditional culture to shape a fresh identity for young South Africans
Years later a different kind of dandy emerged through the oswenka (swankers), who performed menial labour for work. The oswenka subculture went beyond simply parading in expensive apparel in the form of suits; it involved competitive performance battles against other dandies.
In a similar way, izikhothane’s extravagant displays of consumption serve as a means of fulfilling psychological needs.
Why this matters
Izikhothane’s seemingly frivolous consumption rituals defy the constraints of their socioeconomic backgrounds. Their fashion choices assert their existence and protest against the enduring effects of apartheid. Their actions challenge conventional notions of rebellion and provide a poignant commentary on the complexities of identity, inequality and resistance.
The izikhothane of post-apartheid South Africa show us the power of consumption to challenge social norms and resist structural injustices. Their conspicuous consumption, while seemingly destructive, can be interpreted as a way of asserting identity and demanding recognition in a society that has historically treated those who look like them as invisible and less than human.",Izikhothane: a deeper history of a South African youth subculture where luxury items are trashed,arts + culture
"The influential Caine Prize for African Writing for 2023 was won by a power couple from Senegal. Their short story A Soul of Small Places (which can be read over here) echoes deeper trends in the country’s literature while picking up on the growth of horror and speculative fiction across the continent. African literature specialist Caroline D. Laurent explains.
What’s the Caine Prize and what does winning it mean?
The Caine Prize, awarded annually since 2000, acknowledges a short story written in English by an African author. Its objective is to introduce African literature to a broader readership. It’s named in honour of Sir Michael Harris Caine, co-founder of the Man Booker Prize. It consists, firstly, of a £10,000 cash prize for its winner(s). Winning it provides the opportunity for writers to discuss their work, engage with fellow writers, meet with the press and publish their work in the Caine Prize anthology, all with the prospect of gaining recognition. It often serves as a springboard for further publication. It’s helped launch the careers of writers like Nigerian novelists Helon Habila and Tope Folarin, Zimbabwean novelist NoViolet Bulawayo and Zambia’s Namwali Serpell.
Who are this year’s winners?
This year’s winners are a duo of Senegalese writers, Woppa Diallo and Mame Bougouma Diene. Diallo is a lawyer and feminist activist who, at 15, founded The Association for Keeping Girls in School in Matam, Senegal. Her work served as the inspiration for the winning story, hence the main protagonist’s name, Woppa Diallo.
Diene is a Franco-Senegalese American humanitarian and writer. He serves as the francophone spokesperson for the African Speculative Fiction Society and contributes as a columnist to Strange Horizons, an online speculative fiction magazine. His debut collection Dark Moons Rising on a Starless Night was nominated for two 2019 Splatterpunk Awards. He often blends elements of horror, social issues and local beliefs in his work. A Soul of Small Places is an example of his preferred genres.
What’s the story about?
A Soul of Small Places is about Woppa, a young girl who lives in the rural town of Matam in Senegal. Woppa has the task of protecting her younger sister Awa on their way to school. Indeed, girls going to school are often the prey of men who sexually assault them and force them into early marriages. Woppa and Awa’s daily experience of fear to and from school highlights the lack of response from both the authorities and citizens. Gender-based violence remains shrouded in silence, suppressed by feelings of shame and guilt. Hence the intervention of the Soukounio, a flesh-eating djinn who, in this narrative, serves as a protector and avenger of young girls. When all else fails, it is only the gods who can safeguard the girls of Matam.
Why’s it so good?
A Soul of Small Places is a beautifully written short story that has been aptly described by the Caine Prize judges as “tender and poetic”. However, it’s also a harrowing and infuriating tale. The power of literature to focus on individuals and their personal experiences lends a human face to an unresolved social issue. The authors’ skilful use of suspense and horror to convey this idea leaves a profound impact on the reader, with the hope of prompting them to consider the issue and take action.
Read more: Mohamed Mbougar Sarr: Senegalese novelist's win is a landmark for African literature
Diallo and Diene’s story is deeply rooted in its local setting. Matam is described as the second hottest place in Senegal and the heat is palpable in the description of the landscape, where nature is both menacing and protective. References to different gods and spirits also highlight the environment in which Woppa and her family live. However, this short story can also resonate with the fears experienced by young girls and women globally. The anxiety of girls walking home after sunset is something many women have experienced. A Soul of Small Places portrays experiences that, unfortunately, are all too universal. The lack of adequate responses also resonates, regardless of where one lives.
What does this say about Senegalese fiction?
Recently, Senegalese fiction has engaged with important issues in Senegal, whether pertaining to homophobia – as seen in Mohamed Mbougar Sarr’s De Purs Hommes (Pure Men) – or gender-based sexual violence, as seen in A Soul of Small Places.
Read more: New Kiswahili science fiction award charts a path for African languages
Also worth noting is that Diallo and Diene wrote their story in English, not French, the language of Senegal’s former colonisers. The choice to write in English works to dismantle the neocolonial use of languages based on one’s origin and the colonial past of one’s country. In this sense, English appears more as a global language. The Kiswahili Prize for African Literature, where authors write in African languages, complements the Caine Prize. The fact that languages are being redistributed points to the dynamism of African literature, challenging the use of the languages of former colonisers in different ways.
Senegalese literature plays a vital role in encouraging people to read, reflect upon and engage with significant matters in the country. Literature serves as a tool for recognition, understanding and action. A Soul of Small Places is a beautiful, terrifying example of this.",Caine Prize 2023: Senegalese writers win for fantasy-horror story about dangers facing girls,arts + culture
"Nigerian thriller The Black Book has been in the headlines for reportedly topping global figures at streaming service Netflix, with 5.6 million viewers in its first two days. Does it live up to the hype?
In my view, as a critic, scholar and teacher of Nigerian film and storytelling, the short answer is yes. Directed and co-written by newcomer Editi Effiong, The Black Book emerges as a significant film that establishes a new milestone for Nollywood, the ever-evolving Nigerian film industry.
It achieves this by combining several key factors: high production values, a desire to break the mould by offering an outspoken and relevant political critique, and an ability to master new digital opportunities – including those offered by the likes of Netflix.
What it’s about
Set in Lagos and Kaduna states, this action thriller delves into intricate themes of power, revenge and corruption. At first the film centres on Professor Stella Craig, boss of the Nigeria Energy & Oil Company. She embarks on an investigation into oil blocks apparently controlled by a corrupt cartel led by General Issa. The story opens with the kidnap and subsequent murder of her husband and new-born child, despite her willingness to resign voluntarily.
When a tall, dark suspect with dreadlocks is arrested but later released, a hunt for the kidnappers begins. Damilola Edima, an enterprising young man, becomes an unfortunate victim of jungle justice. His father, Paul Edima, a deacon and former hitman, is determined to find justice for his son. His revenge mission focuses on finding a black book. The contents of the book can dismantle the cartel.
Is it any good?
The Black Book stands out because of its thrilling storyline. It pays meticulous attention to detail while also making poignant references to Nigerian history and society. It unfolds against a backdrop of prominent individuals and governmental bodies, echoing real-world events like insecurity, corruption and police brutality.
The movie emphasises outdoor scenes that captivate the audience with spectacular visuals. As Effiong’s feature directing debut, it represents a groundbreaking achievement in Nollywood for both the scope of the action and the fact that this action is able to capture the essence of contemporary Nigeria.
The Black Book portrays a nation grappling with corruption within the ruling class and the pervasive influence of manipulative kingmakers. It reflects a society where insecurity is perpetrated by security officials, free speech is stifled and honest journalism suppressed. Watching it is a visceral experience of a country of both beauty and lurking dangers. Ultimately, it’s a reminder of the cost of justice, especially for the vulnerable in society.
Ankle Films/Netflix
Several projects have paved the way for a film like The Black Book. It was met with the kind of anticipation that recalls the excitement generated by Nigerian director Teco Benson’s 1990s action films. In 2022 the Netflix mini-series Blood Sisters broke new ground for Nigerian thrillers by offering unconventional portrayals of young women instead of the usual romance narratives.
The Black Book pushes the boundaries further. Its gritty politics is excellently researched. Editi Effiong’s direction chooses each word spoken and each visual with meticulous care.
He demonstrates a level of competence, dedication and cultural awareness that Nollywood needs to engage in, especially if it’s to sustain its global audience. A tech and advertising expert turned producer turned director, Effiong represents a new school of digital savvy that complements the art of streaming.
Nollywood’s development
Rising professionalism and compelling storytelling is tapping into on-demand distribution platforms, expanding the horizons of Nollywood. The industry initially gained global recognition for its huge output of direct-to-CD and DVD productions. It has moved from operating within an informal economy to reach a broader international audience.
Nollywood has historically been criticised for its low budgets, lack of professionalism and rushed production processes. This has led some film-makers to distance themselves from the term “Nollywood”. Updated terms like “new Nollywood” or “beyond Nollywood” emerged to describe a new phase in its development.
Insecurity in Nigeria drives the plot. Screengrab/Anakle Films/Netflix
I have interpreted “new Nollywood” as an economic strategy and a phase in the history of the industry’s development rather than a categorisation of the films themselves. Previously I discussed factors promoting the new Nollywood era. I argue that professionalism and access to elite audiences are reshaping the industry.
Now I add that Netflix and other multinational streaming platforms have raised the bar even higher. The Black Book stands as a testament to this evolving landscape. The future appears promising, with The Black Book serving as a significant chapter in shaping a bold cinematic future.
Should you watch it? Yes, especially if thrillers are your thing. It’s gripping and entertaining. It resonates with a global audience particularly because of its exceptional production qualities. Its high-octane action sequences and streamlined narrative are a vehicle for the film to stand out as atypical of old Nollywood yet still quintessentially Nigerian.",The Black Book is a gritty new thriller that raises the bar for Nollywood,arts + culture
"War in the Middle East plunged humanity to new lows on Sunday 8 October 2023 that have gripped international attention since. If that were not the case, the world would likely be abuzz with the breathtaking exploits of a 23-year-old Kenyan who changed running history in Chicago on the same day.
Kelvin Kiptum, running just his third marathon, finished the 42.195 kilometre race in 2h 00m 35s. This lowered the previous world record set by countryman Eliud Kipchoge in Berlin last year, by a whopping 34 seconds. This is the first time that the world record has been obliterated by more than 30 seconds since official ratification began 20 years ago. The better-known Kipchoge comes closest for clipping 30 seconds off his own mark in 2022.
Kiptum’s jaw-dropping average pace was 21 kilometres per hour (13.04 mph) or just 2 minutes and 51.5 seconds per kilometre (4:36.0 min/mile).
My interest as a data scientist and economist (and fellow runner) lies in analysing the historical progression of the men’s and women’s world marathon records.
Can the extraordinary feats of human endeavour be submitted to statistical analysis?
My approach is to think of the marathon world record progression as a bit like watching developments in technology. In both, many factors can lead to a performance gain. In the case of marathon running, this can include training regime, nutrition, psychological preparedness and equipment.
On 8 October, Kiptum didn’t only set a new mark. He also changed the trajectory of the marathon world record.
By my calculations and analysis he has, in all likelihood, set the scene for the “sub-2 hour” marathon mark to fall in the next few years. Prior to Kiptum’s run, I was less convinced we would see the milestone fall before the end of the decade.
Why are we still talking about ‘sub-2’?
Didn’t Kipchoge already go “sub-2” back in 2019? Well, not really.
Athletics is one of those sports where official record keeping really counts. Courses have to be measured (three times) to within a centimetre, lines must be crisp and clear, hurdles must be set out in rows with military precision and athletes must crouch frozen in place without as much as a hair moving until the starter’s gun rings out. There’s a whole rulebook set down by the International Association of Athletics Federation for a road marathon to be called “official”.
And so, when Kipchoge (backed by a million-dollar funded team) ran as the only “competitor” for 1h 59m and 40s around the Prater Hauptallee in Vienna in October 2019, everyone, including Kipchoge, knew this was not the end of the grand search for an official sub-2.
The world record remained at Kipchoge’s own 2h 1m 39s set in the Berlin marathon in September 2018. Kipchoge would go on to lower his own official marathon world record to 2h 1m 9s in September last year, also in the Berlin marathon.
And that is where the official record stayed, until October 8.
How good was Kiptum’s new world record?
There are many ways we could answer this question. For amateurs and elites alike, there are so many ways that one could seek to improve their performance. These include (though the list is much longer):
training choices (volume, intensity, rest, cross-training)
nutrition (micro- and macro-nutrients, pre-race fuelling, in-race hydration)
psychological training (set-backs, performance anxiety, boredom, motivation, self-talk)
equipment tech in shoes and apparel.
From the standpoint of statistical and economic analysis, after making a few assumptions, we can expect that the arrival of a world record in the marathon might follow a defined pattern. So much so, we can model the historical times, which is to say, fit a mathematical formula to them, and so, gain insights about the present and the future.
Economists have been modelling athletic performance for decades. We now know that so long as the arrival rate of small improvements (think: a new supplement, shoe foam, or training aid) across each factor is roughly consistent over time, we should expect that the summary outcome will have reasonably predictable behaviour. It’s this overall process we can model.
My approach is to fit a model to the average trend of marathon world record times over several decades, and then to estimate the likelihood of going below this trend to run a given time on a given day.
First up, we can model the historical progression of the male world record as if we didn’t know about Kipchoge’s 2022 world record and Kiptum’s new mark. This will tell us how unusual (or unexpected) these times were, from the perspective of history.
What we find is that, whereas Kipchoge’s run on that particular September 2022 day (“+” in figure below) was remarkable, with a likelihood of close to “1 in 4” chance, based on history, Kiptum’s run was, statistically speaking, more impressive. Kiptum’s run (“x” in the figure below) lands closer to the “1 in 10” likelihood line.

In other words, Kiptum’s performance is less expected (or more unusual), based on the historical world record progression line, than Kipchoge’s. This is so even if you take into account the natural progression of the world record we’d expect over the year between the runs.
Given how amazing Kipchoge’s Berlin 2022 run was, that’s saying something.
Does Kiptum change sub-2 expectations?
Let’s suppose that a hypothetical runner in the mould of Kiptum was at the start line in future (official) marathons. When would they go sub-2?
By following the “1 in 10” line out into the future, we see that it crosses the 2 hour line in May 2032. This is no different to what I predicted four years ago.
However, what if we allow our modelling procedure to take account of both Kipchoge’s and Kiptum’s new 2022 and 2023 world records respectively?
When I add only Kipchoge’s mark, and work with a runner like Kipchoge at “1 in 4” likelihood, the sub-2 moment doesn’t change very much, moving forward by just a few months to November 2031.
However, if we further add Kiptum’s more extraordinary run, something remarkable happens.
Modelling the historical male marathon world record progression with new world records set by Kipchoge (2022) and Kiptum (2023). Author created.
First, the model learns to be a bit more accommodating of Kiptum-like performances. In effect, he becomes a bit less extraordinary, tracking closer to the updated “1 in 4” likelihood line.
Second, if we follow this line – that is, we assume that a Kiptum-like runner is at the start line in future official marathons – then we find that the arrival of a sub-2 marathon has been brought forward by five years to March 2027.
In effect, Kiptum (and to some extent Kipchoge in 2022) have been able to nudge all of marathon world-record history just enough to make the sub-2 moment a likely reality in the next few years.
Will we see more records beyond sub-2?
These curves tell us something else. If we run them out to the far distant future, they eventually settle on the very fastest time anyone might ever run in the marathon. The “limits”, if you will, of human performance.
If we follow the “Kiptum line” (“1 in 4” likelihood) we find that it settles at 1h 55m 40s. Around 2 minutes faster than my prediction for the same four years ago. Again, Kiptum has made his mark.
If there’s anything reassuring about this analysis, especially for those who love the marathon and this period of amazing running by men and women alike, even when (not if) the sub-2 mark is done, the limit is still over 4 minutes ahead!
In high performance terms, even after someone goes sub-2, there’s still a lot to play for.",Marathon under 2 hours is closer than ever – scientist shows how Kenya’s Kiptum tests human limits,arts + culture
"The 2030 men’s football World Cup will be co-hosted by three countries across two continents after Morocco, Spain and Portugal’s successful bid was selected by Fifa, the sport’s world governing body.
For the north African country of Morocco, this represents a milestone after five unsuccessful bids. It becomes just the second African and second Arab country to host the prestigious tournament – after South Africa in 2010 and Qatar in 2022.
Read more: Israel-Hamas war: updates on The Conversation's coverage of the conflict
But there’s a bigger picture. The news can be celebrated as a symbol of reconciliation among three historically intertwined countries. After all, the Mediterranean Sea separating Africa (Morocco) from Europe (Spain and Portugal) is a symbol of the tragic crossing of migrants from Africa, many of whom die before reaching the other side.
And there’s an even deeper history to reconcile, going back to the centuries of Arab-Berber-Islamic presence in the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal) between 711 and 1492. The Christian Reconquista in medieval Spain and Portugal in 1492 triggered a mass exodus of Muslims and Jews to the other, Muslim-dominated side of the Mediterranean, including what is today Morocco. This followed the Spanish and Portuguese invasion of parts of north Africa.
So, as a scholar of sports politics and policy with a particular focus on the Middle East and North Africa, I find the 2030 World Cup to be set against an intriguing geopolitical backdrop.
The complex history between Morocco and Spain and Portugal, coupled with the prospect of an Arab state hosting the event again, intersects with two particularly sensitive political issues today: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Morocco’s control of the Western Sahara territory.
Israel and Palestine
The World Cup often brings political tensions to the fore. One such tension is the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which Morocco will have to negotiate as a fellow Arab state and ally of Israel. The issue of Israel’s occupation of Palestine reared its head at the Qatar World Cup and will do so again in 2030.
Morocco established full diplomatic ties with Israel, including a military pact, in 2020 following the Abraham Accords. The deals also encompass the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
The issue of Israeli football fans and media visiting Qatar in 2022 was approached with caution. This was particularly evident in the introduction of direct flights from Israel and of consulate support in Qatar. Football stadiums became a barometer of public sentiment. Some Arab and Moroccan spectators, including members of the Moroccan national team, displayed the Palestinian flag as a symbol of their ongoing support for Palestinian self-determination.
Read more: Morocco at the 2022 World Cup: 6 forces behind a history-making performance
At the 2030 Fifa World Cup, the issue will likely be handled differently. Many Israelis have Moroccan roots (it’s estimated 700,000 Israeli Jews are of Moroccan descent). The tournament could offer Israeli football fans a chance to reconnect with their Moroccan heritage. This may be extra motivation for Israel to qualify for the cup – if their world football ranking continues to improve.
An increasing number of national teams are qualifying for the World Cup. Teams from north Africa with strong football traditions are more likely to qualify. This raises the possibility of fans from Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt travelling to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. And the Palestinian issue will affect Arab-Israeli relations on and off the pitch.
Morocco will need to manage potential security threats and possible confrontations between pro-Israel and pro-Palestine fans from the Arab world, Turkey and Iran.
Western Sahara
Morocco will also undoubtedly use the 2030 cup to strengthen its position around the former Spanish territory of Western Sahara. Morocco claims sovereignty over the territory by supporting an autonomy plan. In this, it’s backed by Israel.
Western Sahara – or Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic – is a disputed territory in the Maghreb region. The dispute began in 1975 when colonial Spain withdrew from the region. In the aftermath, Morocco organised the “Green March”. Thousands of Moroccan civilians entered Western Sahara and asserted sovereignty. Nearly half the population fled into neighbouring Algeria, where they and their descendants remain in refugee camps. The Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in 1976, with a government in exile in Algeria. Since then there’s been an ongoing territorial conflict between Morocco and the native Saharawi people.
Read more: Western Sahara: the six-decade struggle to liberate Africa's last colony
Moroccan authorities will most likely use the World Cup to assert control over Western Sahara and promote the region’s tourist potential. It may even host some matches there. Morocco has actively used sports for national branding, hosting various events in Western Sahara. This puts Fifa and the Confederation of African Football – as well as contenders – in a politically sensitive position.
Algeria, home to the Polisario, may decide to boycott Morocco’s hosting of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations football tournament and the 2030 World Cup. As a political entity the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic – a member of the African Union though not of Fifa – is recognised by many United Nations member countries.
Like the Palestinian question, the evolution of the Western Sahara issue by 2030 remains uncertain, especially considering Morocco’s recent efforts to gain support for its Western Sahara plan among its allies, including Spain.
More than sport
As a football enthusiast of north African heritage, I’m delighted Morocco will host such a monumental tournament. For fans in north Africa and across the Arab world, this is another opportunity, after Qatar, to experience the games from within.
However, it’s clear to me, as an academic immersed in the business and political dynamics of football, that Morocco’s co-hosting of the 2030 World Cup brings forth substantial political and security intricacies that demand thorough analysis. This observation extends to the other co-hosts, Spain and Portugal, where similar complexities may arise.
Let’s anticipate that once the World Cup commences, the fervour for football will rightfully claim the spotlight, without exacerbating conflicts off the field.",Morocco will co-host the 2030 World Cup – Palestine and Western Sahara will be burning issues,arts + culture
"South African rapper Sho Madjozi is a bold and colourful presence in pop culture, as famous for her catchy lyrics as for using traditional clothing and dance in a fresh way.
The musician, actress and poet is also one of very few young South African artists working in a minority language, Xitsonga. With 12 official languages in South Africa, Xitsonga is the first language of only about 4.5% of the population, mostly in the rural northern province of the country called Limpopo. The Tsonga people also live in neighbouring Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Eswatini.
Yet, in 2019, “village girl” Sho Madjozi burst onto the world stage with her hit song John Cena, winning a BET award in the US for Best International Newcomer. By 2021 she had established herself as best female artist at the South African Music Awards.
But Sho Madjozi is about more than music. She’s also about setting trends – through reinventing Tsonga costume, hairstyles and dance. She’s done this in a way that helps shape her region’s cultural identity.
Cultural identity is not something that’s fixed. Identities change, transcending time, place and history. Sho Madjozi shows how this happens when she mixes the authentic culture of the Tsonga people with popular global culture to produce a unique – or hybrid – identity and performance style.
We recently published a research paper that analyses this. We place her as an artist whose work demonstrates a fascinating interface between the “authentic” (Tsonga culture) and the “hybrid” (an innovative new voice, with innovation and novelty being central to the global culture industries).
We conclude that by merging popular and traditional cultures, Sho Madjozi is the latest in a long line of young African artists who help shape youth culture identity. In the process she shines a light on a lesser-known ethnic group, keeping traditional knowledge alive so that others may learn from it and be inspired by it.
Who is Sho Madjozi?
Sho Madjozi was born Maya Christinah Xichavo Wegerif, from a biracial union between her Swedish father and Tsonga mother. This provides a further fascinating framework for the idea of authenticity and hybridity in her work.
In South Africa, colonialism and apartheid suppressed indigenous cultures. Apartheid, introduced by a white-minority government, was a policy based on separate development for different racially categorised people. The law banned sexual relations between people categorised as black and white. Yet people fell in love across the colour lines.
Sho Madjozi’s mixed parentage creates a hybrid form of identity because of historical processes of cultural contact, transformation and change among different peoples of the world.
As if to underscore the in-betweenness of her cultural heritage, a considerable part of her youth and childhood was spent in Senegal in west Africa. This also demonstrates the notion of circulation that characterises the contemporary Afropolitan (a generation that is both African and cosmopolitan).
Sho Madjozi chose proudly to adopt a Tsonga signature style in her stage career. She says that, for her, blackness means “not erasing everything that I am … and never accepting a form of beauty where it’s as far away from me as possible”.
She makes it clear that a pure native identity is simply no longer available. In its place comes a moving map of cultural images and an ever-changing sense of self.
Costume, hair and dance
Characteristically, Sho Madjozi adapts and reinterprets the Tsonga tinguvu skirt, commonly called the xibelani skirt as it’s used to perform the traditional xibelani dance. The xibelani skirt is gathered in the waist, accentuated at the top of the hips and consists of many layers of fabric that create a distinctive volume when the wearer dances in it.
Sho Madjozi reinterprets this skirt. She pairs it with modern fashion items, sometimes shortening it or making it longer, reinventing its form. This contrasts and merges indigenous culture with fashion, tradition with modernity, and the local with the global.
She also incorporates vibrant Tsonga colours (pinks, yellows, purples, blues and greens) in her creative reinterpretations of costume. She does the same with her hair, weaving bright Tsonga colours into it, adorning it with beads, experimenting with traditional accessories in her cornrows.
The xibelani dance is also central to Sho Madjozi’s act. It’s native to Tsonga women, where girls learn it to celebrate their heritage and perform it on special occasions. Xibelani means “hitting to the rhythm”. The dancer shakes their hips, exaggerated by the skirt, with the whole body following. This is often accompanied by hand clapping and whistling.
Sho Madjozi’s colourful and iconic redesigns of Tsonga costume are signs of what it means to be Tsonga in southern Africa today. She uses popular urban youth culture to spread Tsonga xibelani culture in a national space.
She does so in a time when young South Africans often find themselves grappling to retain traditional cultural values in an ever-changing and fast-paced globalising world.
Why this matters
Traditional costume often represents old ways that resist change. Sho Madjozi’s innovations around xibelani speak differently. Through her performances, social media image and public profile, she rises above conventional attitudes that often perceive minority ethnic groups as the conservative gatekeepers of unchanging cultures.
She presents Tsonga tradition and culture at the cutting edge of positive identity formation. She does so in ways that inspire, attract and convince other young South Africans to embrace local cultures in their own construction of urban identities.
She acts as a cultural agent for the transmission of positive change and values across ethnic, national and international boundaries.
Sho Madjozi embodies the words of Taiye Selasi, the young British-born, US-based writer, photographer and cultural activist of Nigerian and Ghanaian origin. Selasi says:
What distinguishes (Afropolitans) is a willingness to complicate Africa … we seek to comprehend the cultural complexity, to honour the intellectual and spiritual legacy, and to sustain our parents’ cultures.",Sho Madjozi: the pop star using traditional culture to shape a fresh identity for young South Africans,arts + culture
"The Catholic church today is deeply polarised. This has created doctrinal fissures that are seemingly unbridgeable.
There are many rumbling contestations on questions of identity, mission, faith and morality. Other questions touch on pastoral life, the nature of marriage and family life, denial of holy communion to divorced and remarried Catholics, clerical celibacy, authority in the church and reproductive rights.
There is also a serious erosion of religious authority. Many church leaders have lost their credibility because of what Pope Francis calls the “leprosy of clerical sexual abuse” and financial scandals.
The church in Africa hasn’t been spared these issues. In parts of the continent, the challenges of ethnocentrism, abuse of religious authority and internal division are hurting the church’s credibility and effectiveness. And some national churches seem silent on rising crises of democracy and leadership across Africa.
There have always been divisions in the church, but its effectiveness and credibility in Africa have been affected by clannish divisions and internal fights over money, power and position. This raises the question: how can the church be the conscience of the continent if it’s ravaged by the same internal problems found in political institutions?
Most of the controversies that faced the church in its first 500 years were resolved through basic synodal principles – the word synod means “walking together”. These principles were developed by African scholars and church leaders like Cyprian, Athanasius, Aurelius and Augustine.
In 2021, Pope Francis convened a worldwide consultation on the future of the Catholic church. This synod will conclude in 2024. Decisions made this year and next will define the future of modern Catholicism for many years to come.
Read more: Pope Francis: the first post-colonial papacy to deliver messages that resonate with Africans
Sadly, in the process so far, there seems to be no clear African agenda articulated through African Catholic church leaders.
I have observed the preparations of Africa for this synod. I’m afraid that the mistakes made by the continent’s church leaders in previous synods – including two held specially to address Africa’s challenges in 1994 and 2010 – are being repeated.
The African continental meeting that took place in Ethiopia in March 2023 didn’t come up with a clear agenda to address the challenges facing African Catholics.
African delegates are faced with three major challenges going into the current consultations. First, they are simply responding to what is tabled in the working document for the synod rather than setting their own agenda. Second, they are treating the continent like a homogeneous entity. Third, they’re failing to demonstrate the changes that African Catholic leaders wish to make in their leadership styles, and pastoral and social ministries in local dioceses and religious congregations, without constantly looking up to Rome for instructions and directions.
Drowned voices
The latest synodal process began in 2021 with grassroots consultations, and national and continental assemblies. It has now entered the most decisive moment.
This is why it is important that African voices are heard. As a theologian who has studied the development of the synodal process in Africa, I worry that African Catholic voices may instead be drowned.
First, African delegates at the synod are not formulating their own agenda. During the two consultations on the family in 2014 and 2015, Africans framed their responses to the synod’s working document as a rejection of a western agenda for change to the traditional family. They pushed back against a perceived attempt to impose on the rest of the church a new understanding of marriage that includes the blessing of same-sex relations.
African delegates have failed to present their position on how to deal with issues of marriage, polygamy, denial of communion to polygamists, childlessness, burial rites and widowhood practices.
Read more: Pope Francis' visit to Africa comes at a defining moment for the Catholic church
Second, the problems that face Africa are often localised. They require contextualised solutions. Yet, African delegates often treat the continent as homogeneous, with similar social, economic and political challenges. In the 2015 synod, Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea appealed to the delegates from Africa to speak with one voice, as if Africa had one voice.
There is a need to present Africa in its diversity and richness. The churches of Europe, for instance, have always presented their issues in a more localised, national and specific sense – the German Catholic Church is implementing its own synodal path. African delegates must resist the continued colonial structure, racialised thinking and mentality that sees Africa as one country rather than a continent of diversity and dynamic pluralism.
Finally, African delegates must move away from constantly asking Rome and the pope to help solve the issues within the church in Africa. The delegates must focus attention on the current situation of the church and society in Africa, and how African Catholics can solve their own problems by courageously confronting the internal challenges facing the church in the continent.
The Catholic church is witnessing its fastest growth in Africa (2.1% between 2019 and 2020). Out of a global population of 1.36 billion Catholics, 236 million are African (20% of the total). This growth is happening alongside a rise in poverty, social unrest, coups, wars and illiberal democracy.
What next
African delegates must demonstrate a deeper understanding of the continent’s social and religious challenges. They must capture the hopes and dreams of their congregants, and articulate how the Catholic church can support social transformation through authentic and credible religious experiences and practices.
Pope Francis has said the future of the church and the world will be determined by how those who inhabit the peripheries of life are lifted up. African delegates need to speak up for the millions of Africans who are poor and marginalised.
The Catholic church in Africa must become a champion for human rights, good governance and women’s empowerment. It needs to model the image of an inclusive church in its structures and priorities. It needs to nurture a new generation of Africans who understand the diverse challenges facing the continent and seek African solutions.",Catholic synod: the voices of church leaders in Africa are not being heard – 3 reasons why,arts + culture
"Witchcraft is generally understood to refer to a supernatural power possessed by an individual. In Ghana, particularly in the northern parts of the country, the subject continues to spark fierce debates.
In regions such as Northern, Savanna and North East, people accused of witchcraft are banished from their communities. In response, other communities have provided refuge for displaced people. These places of refuge have themselves sparked controversy. Critics contend that they have become centres of “abuse” and have called for their closure.
I am a lecturer in anthropology and development studies. I set out to understand the controversy around what are often called “witch camps” and whether they should be abolished. I conducted a year long ethnographic study in the Gnani-Tindang community in northern Ghana. Gnani-Tindang provides refuge for people accused of witchcraft who have been banished from their communities.
I conclude from my findings that government and NGOs aren’t proving capable of managing the problem, because they are starting at the wrong place. The focus is on witchcraft accusations, by which time people have already been stripped of their “social citizenship” and been forced to relocate.
Engaging with the experiences of people accused of witchcraft and their communities shows that intervening at an earlier point matters more.
The background
Victims of witchcraft accusations face alienation or exclusion from their communities. Exclusions can be social, physical, economic or psychological.
Some villages in northern Ghana have become known as places that provide refuge to people banished from their communities. These villages were not created for this purpose. Rather, they are already existing communities that have chosen to provide such refuge.
Banishment happens when someone accused of witchcraft is no longer welcomed in their community. They are asked to leave and never return. Not heeding such advice comes with consequences including violence, abuse, social exclusion and murder.
Sometimes people relocate to a village that’s offering them safety after they’ve been forced to leave their homes following direct threats. In some instances people move when they hear rumours that they risk being accused of witchcraft.
What people who had been banished told me
The purpose of my research inquiry was to gain insights into how individuals accused of witchcraft speak about themselves and their circumstances.
The experiences of those accused varied. As one told me:
They finally threatened that they were going to do their juju, and if I had any knowledge about the child’s sickness, I was going to die within four days. I told them they should go ahead; I was willing to die if I were the one responsible for the child’s sickness. After the ritual, I didn’t die. However, they said I could no longer stay with them in the community.
Another gave this account:
After the death of my husband, the relatives accused me of witchcraft. My in-laws said I killed my husband, but I don’t know anything about it. He fell sick and died afterwards. How can I kill my husband? I was lucky I wasn’t killed. There were lots of chaos, and some of the people suggested that I should be killed. Others disagreed and suggested that I should be brought to Gnani-Tindang … It’s my husband’s people who brought me here.
We also observed that elderly people with little strength to fend for themselves were often targeted. One person, who was 80 years old, said:
Look at me; I’m old and weak now. I can’t do much for myself. But I must fetch water, firewood and beg for food to eat. It is lonely here.
What next
Ghana’s parliament has recently passed an anti-witchcraft bill. It seeks to criminalise the practice of declaring, accusing, naming, or labelling people as witches. Making such an accusation would lead to a prison sentence.
But, in my view, the bill alone isn’t the solution. This is because declaring certain behaviour illegal – and therefore punishable in a court of law – doesn’t address the issue of prejudice and discrimination which often relates to people’s age, gender and economic status. In other words, the law won’t deal with the tensions that emerge when culture intersects with the reality of people who become victims of witchcraft accusations.
Additional steps need to be taken.
Firstly, attention needs to be given to the underlying social issues driving accusations of witchcraft. For example, extreme inequalities among men and women, old and young, rich and poor. Creating avenues that provide a balance in society will have an effect on witchcraft accusation and banishment.
Early gender-tailored education needs to be introduced by the government and development actors on the value of both boys and girls. This is particularly important in the patriarchal societies of northern Ghana. This could help address gender inequalities that lead to witchcraft accusations. Witchcraft accusation is gendered: more women than men are accused, confronted and banished.
There is a need to engage widely with the Ghanaian society about the dangers of witchcraft accusation and to put in mechanisms to protect those who are abused and violated as a result of such accusations.
Finally, there is a need to listen to the voices and experiences of those who are victims of witchcraft accusations. This will ensure that interventions aren’t detached from their reality.",Witchcraft in Ghana: help should come before accusations begin,arts + culture
"A recent book, Queer Bodies in African Films, studies the growing LGBTIQ+ output from film-makers around the continent, from Morocco to South Africa. In the process it analyses what queerness is and means within the context of African countries. Its author, Gibson Ncube, is a lecturer and scholar who focuses his research on queerness in African cultural production – from literature to films. We asked him four questions.
Is there a growing queer representation in films from African countries?
Yes, the last decade has seen a proliferation of these films. Nigeria’s Nollywood has produced a considerable body of films portraying queer lived experiences. Although most of these experiences remain largely formulaic and moralistic, there have been films like the 2020 lesbian love story Ife which offer positive images of queerness in Nigeria.
NISC
With its long history of queer representation in film, South Africa continues to produce work that highlights the diversity of LGBTIQ+ experiences. Christiaan Olwagen’s coming-of-age war musical Kanarie appeared in 2018. The following year saw Moffie by Oliver Hermanus, set in the apartheid army. And Bonnie Sithebe’s 2022 lesbian drama Valley of a Thousand Hills is set in traditional rural South Africa.
Importantly, there have also been features from countries that previously had not produced such themed films. For example, the 2015 Tchindas is about a queer carnival in Cape Verde. Kapana is a 2020 gay love story from Namibia. A documentary about being gay in conservative Sudan, The Art of Sin, appeared in 2020.
Also, there have been films from countries with some of the harshest LGBTIQ+ laws, such as Nigeria (Hell and High Water), Uganda (The Pearl of Uganda) and Kenya (I am Samuel).
But film-makers still have to contend with diverse forms of banning and censorship. This does not, of course, diminish the films’ growing influence.
African queer films often navigate unique social, cultural and political challenges – such as deep rooted homophobia and colonial legacies. They explore the complexities of being both queer and African, and often incorporate traditional cultural elements. These films contribute to a broader global discourse on queer issues while offering distinct perspectives and narratives.
What is the book’s main argument?
The main argument is in two parts. Firstly, I argue that the body is central in understanding queerness in African film. I first watched some of the films in their original languages and without subtitles. Although I did not understand languages like Afrikaans, Arabic or Kiswahili, I found that the visuality of queer bodies told stories. The bodies told stories in a language that wasn’t verbal or oral.
Secondly, I contend that it is important to think of how queer bodies come into being in different parts of the continent. I undertake a pan-African reading of films from various regions to emphasise not only the differences in how they depict queer bodies but also the shared experiences that transcend regional and cultural differences.
One of the main differences between films north and south of the Sahara is the openness of depicting queerness. In north African films, queerness exists in silence and is expressed through suggestive language. In sub-Saharan films, there is a move to more unconcealed representations. But the films capture the cultural and social realities of the societies being portrayed.
Please tell us about a few of the films you studied
Some were better known than others. I examined contemporary films like Skoonheid (Beauty) by Oliver Hermanus, the 2011 gay drama set in a conservative Afrikaans community, and the 2013 Moroccan coming-of-age drama Salvation Army by Abdellah Taïa. I also looked at the gay 2017 Xhosa initiation school drama Inxeba/The Wound by John Trengove and the 2018 Kenyan lesbian romance Rafiki by Wanuri Kahiu.
These films have attracted considerable academic attention. But I reread them by focusing on the representation of the queer bodies.
For example, Inxeba has previously been analysed for the way in which queerness exists within the traditional Xhosa ceremonies of ulwaluko (circumcision and rites of initiation into manhood). I concentrate rather on the penis and how ulwaluko is a process of conferring symbolic and cultural authority to this organ. I demonstrate that the penis can be a site of rethinking masculinity and also what queerness means in traditional black societies of post-apartheid South Africa. Instead of portraying the penis as virile and domineering, Inxeba considers the penis as vulnerable and feeble. Through this focus, I attempt to understand queer embodiment.
I also examine little-known films from north Africa like the 2009 lesbian drama Al Dowaha (Buried Secrets) by Tunisian director Raja Amari and the 2006 Muslim drama exploring masculinity Imarat Yácubyan (The Yacoubian Building) by Egyptian film-maker Marwan Hamed.
Through their varied depictions, these films play a significant role in making visible marginalised gender and sexual identities. They provide a crucial visual archive that contributes to our understanding of queer lives in north Africa.
What did you learn from studying these films?
Studying these films has yielded a profound understanding of queer experiences within diverse African cultural contexts. They undoubtedly shape our understanding of queer lives and experiences in a continent where queerphobia remains rampant.
The films provide vital representation, challenging stereotypes and fostering visibility for marginalised communities. African queer cinema contributes to global discussions on important human rights questions.
The films also showcase cinematic innovation and underscore the role of media in social change. Moreover, studying these films chronicles the journey of queer rights in Africa. It reflects both progress and setbacks, while fostering community building and solidarity among queer individuals and allies.
The book highlights the rich diversity of experiences within African LGBTQ+ communities. It debunks the myth that queerness is unAfrican and a western import and shows that queer individuals have always been part of African societies.",Queer film in Africa is rising – even in countries with the harshest anti-LGBTIQ+ laws,arts + culture
"In the world of sports, some stories transcend the boundaries of the game and become symbolic of something greater. Siya Kolisi’s journey from an adverse upbringing to becoming captain of a World Cup-winning South African rugby team, the Springboks, is one such story.
Kolisi made history as the first black captain of the Springboks in a country where, because of apartheid and separate development, the professional sport was once an all-white affair. Rugby was firmly associated with white national pride, and now a black man from a humble background has become a national hero, reshaping the sport’s image.

Despite being a democracy since 1994, South Africa continues to struggle to forge a unified and equitable society while acknowledging its diverse cultural heritage. Kolisi’s appointment as captain in 2018 signalled a new chapter of inclusivity, diversity and unity.
As an industrial psychologist, I have a particular interest in psychobiographical studies. Psychobiographies provide insights into the lives and minds of historically significant individuals like Kolisi. Understanding their inner and external worlds helps us grasp their motivations and actions – and the broader context of their impact on society. This enriches our knowledge of history and human behaviour.
Kolisi’s story defies the odds and highlights the power of resilience, the ability to bounce back from adversity, trauma or setbacks. It empowers other people to navigate and overcome life’s challenges. With effective coping strategies and support systems, resilience can foster personal growth, adaptability and mental wellbeing. This ultimately shapes people into more resourceful individuals.
The early years
Siyamthanda Kolisi was born in 1991 in Zwide, in Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth) in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Although apartheid had all but ended, social and economic inequalities persisted. Many black people continued living in disadvantaged settlements on the outskirts of cities and towns. They had limited employment opportunities and schools were under-resourced.
From the outset, Kolisi faced many challenges that could have derailed his dreams. He lived in a society plagued with poverty, malnutrition, crime, substance misuse and violence.
According to his autobiography, his parents were both teenagers when he was born. As a result, he was raised by his grandmother, who performed ad hoc jobs until she could no longer work. Kolisi had to look after her until her death. Losing his primary caregiver was one of his most significant early challenges. His grandmother died in his arms when he was 12. Kolisi wrote:
The one person who’d loved me unconditionally had gone, and without her, Zwide could seem an even scarier place than before.
His upbringing reflects the resilience of countless South Africans striving for a better life. In 2002, he joined a local rugby team which provided him with a crucial positive role model in headmaster and coach Eric Songwiqi. This new environment offered a structure that was missing in his life after the loss of his grandmother. The support from his coach and the responsibility he felt towards his teammates prompted a transformation in his coping strategies.
Coping strategies create resilience
Kolisi’s story serves as a powerful testament to the concept of resilience: how individuals adapt and grow in response to challenges. Sometimes, people engage in socially unacceptable behaviours as coping mechanisms to survive their harsh realities.
In his early years, Kolisi engaged in substance misuse, violence, aggressiveness and self-destructive behaviour to cope with challenges and form an identity to fit in to his society. Playing rugby, attending school, spirituality and faith also helped him cope.
His journey encompasses socially acceptable and unacceptable behaviours, demonstrating that overcoming adversity is dynamic. Our backgrounds, life experiences and the societies we belong to shape who we are and our lives’ direction.
In a broader context, Kolisi’s story highlights the importance of recognising diverse social and cultural influences on human development. I believe that psychologists need more inclusive and culturally sensitive approaches to understanding human development.
Our lives are like puzzles with many different pieces. Some of these might cause problems or risks, while others help keep us safe and secure. These risky and protective pieces all come together to shape our lives.
Rugby as a lifeline
Rugby played an important role in Kolisi’s life, both on and off the field. In a team environment, he found solace and a nurturing environment that provided security, a sense of belonging. A refuge from his chaotic life at home and in society.
From this, we can see that our social and cultural context significantly shapes our lives. And while context can be a source of harmony and discord in human development, it’s possible to get past adversity with resilience and determination.
One of the key takeaways from my study of Kolisi is the importance of viewing marginalised individuals holistically. Individuals are not defined solely by their circumstances. By understanding the multifaceted aspects of their lives, we can help them on their journey towards success and fulfilment.
Beyond rugby
Kolisi’s resilience and success is not limited to rugby. He’s used his platform to make a positive impact in his community and beyond. Through the Kolisi Foundation he has provided opportunities and support to improve the lives of disadvantaged communities.

This includes providing safe spaces through sport and education, addressing gender-based violence and contributing to food security. His commitment to giving back reflects his belief in the ubuntu philosophy of humanity towards others. The journey from adversity to triumph is not complete until others are uplifted.
Resilience matters
Kolisi’s story is not just about overcoming adversity but finding purpose and meaning in that adversity.
He reminds us that no matter where we come from, we have the potential to rise above adversity, challenge the status quo and shape a brighter future.

"Former Malian footballer Salif “Domingo” Këita, who passed away on 2 September in Bamako, embodied a crucial moment in the history of African football, helping shape its relationship with the world. His influence was also felt in Europe, when he helped shine a light on the rights of French footballers at a critical time.
Born on 6 December 1946, the year that the French West African Cup was created, Keïta (not to be confused with Salif Keita the musician) was also an important leader in Malian football.
As a scholar of contemporary history, with research interests in the political, cultural and global history of football, I have followed Keïta’s career and believe that it’s as important to remember the man and the role he played as it is to remember the player.
Starting out
Salif Keïta grew up in Bamako, Mali, in a family of eight children. It wasn’t easy for him to make his father, a haulage contractor by trade, understand that he preferred football to his studies, even though he eventually qualified to work as a grinder. Football began as an informal activity, even before he started playing in his neighbourhood team in Bamako.
At just 14 he joined the Pionniers club, a product of a form of “progressive” scouting modelled on the socialist countries dear to President Modibo Keïta. His dribbling, shooting and heading skills soon propelled him into the Real Bamako squad. He played in and lost two African Champions League finals, one with Real and the other with Stade Malien, to whom he was loaned for the occasion. He also began to take his first steps in Mali’s national team.
Going to France
But Keïta was aiming higher than national fame. Through postcolonial networks, he came into contact with the directors of French club AS Saint-Etienne, who had good relations with Charles Dagher, a Lebanese trader from Bamako. In September 1967, Keïta was smuggled to Liberia, then flew from there to Orly in France. The directors of the “Greens” (AS Saint-Etienne’s nickname) were not at the airport to meet him and so a young Keïta hailed a taxi to take him straight to the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium.
Read more: The fighting spirit of young African footballers who migrate overseas
Keïta was not the first African player to be recruited by a French club. However, the door that was initially opened to footballers from sub-Saharan Africa in the 1950s had partly closed again. On one hand, African federations wanted to keep their players. On the other hand, the number of foreigners playing for French teams was limited to just two. The Malian football federation would accept his sneaking out of the country and the following November sent him a transfer certificate, the key to his playing rights. But even so, at the time French clubs preferred to sign South American or Yugoslavian players.
They offered African footballers harsh contracts and Keïta initially played as an amateur and not a professional, justified by the club’s managers by the fact that he was studying law in France. He was nevertheless paid, eventually signing a four-year professional contract in 1969.
Triumphs on the field
Even though the winter in Forez, in the Massif Central region of France, was harsh, Keïta quickly made a name for himself. At first, he could count on the advice of coach Albert Batteux and the assistance of Rachid Mekhloufi, an Algerian player for the Greens. Playing as a centre forward, Keïta scored 120 goals in 149 matches. In October 1969, he scored the winner against Bayern Munich in the Champions Cup Round of 16.
With AS Saint-Etienne, he won three French league titles and a French Cup. In 1970, his performances earned him the first African Ballon d'Or award. Eager for a change of scenery, he sought to terminate his contract. This led to a bitter legal dispute with Roger Rocher, the president of AS Saint-Etienne.
Suspended for six months, but supported by many fans, Keïta signed with a new club, Olympique de Marseille, in November 1972. Once again he found himself up against the demands of club directors, who wanted to have him naturalised so that they could field him alongside two foreign but European stars, Josip Skoblar and Roger Magnusson. But Keïta refused what he saw as an attack on his dignity as an African man. He became the subject of a local press cabal’s criticisms, with strong racist undertones.
Taking on the world
Keïta then moved to Valencia from 1973 to 1975, where Alfredo Di Stefano had brought him. Spain was not yet the paragon of the beautiful game, but Keïta’s strikes kept finding the net again – until he was injured in March 1975. At that point, Valencia wanted to transfer him in order to recruit someone else. True to form, he defended his sporting and financial interests and only agreed to leave on condition that he was paid the year’s wages due to him and that the club paid its taxes.
Keïta went on to win the Portuguese league as the country began making a name for itself in world football thanks to its stars of African origin – like Keïta, Eusebio and Mario Coluna. At the age of 31, with the club Sporting Lisbon, he finally found an environment in which he could flourish. He won a Portuguese Cup, before playing a final season in the US from 1979 to 1980.
Back home
Keïta retired just as African football was beginning to reveal itself to the world. His life inspired director Cheik Doukouré’s 1994 film The Golden Ball, in which he played the role of a coach.
Read more: The precarious fate of African footballers in Europe after their game ends
Back home in Mali, he worked as minister delegate to the minister in charge of private initiatives. After the fall of Moussa Traoré, Keïta opened a football training centre in Bamako. He was then elected president of the Mali Football Federation, serving from 2005 until 2009.
But France has not forgotten him. The directors of Saint-Etienne elevated him to the rank of ambassador for the club and two stadiums bear his name – in Saint-Etienne and Cergy-Pontoise. This was their way of honouring a great striker and a man determined to assert his rights in an environment still marked by a certain condescension towards Africa.","Salif Keïta, the defiant Malian football legend who created history on and off the field",arts + culture
"There has been a continued escalation in fighting between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The destruction of the capital Khartoum continues – physically, economically, socially and culturally – as buildings are bombarded and homes looted. One of the city’s landmark skyscrapers, the Greater Nile Petroleum Oil Company Tower, was recently engulfed in flames. We asked three Sudanese architecture experts – Amira Osman, Akram Elkhalifa and Tallal Abdalbasit Saeed – about the skyscraper and the destruction of the city. Osman also interviewed Khartoum-based architects Arwa Ahmed and Hassan Mahmoud for this article as part of her ongoing research.
Why is the tower so prominent and what does it represent?
Amira Osman: The 18-floor skyscraper was constructed in 2010, the first of two towers originally proposed by the local Alsunut Development Company. As architect Hassan Mahmoud told me, “It’s the headquarters of the Greater Nile Petroleum Company, the consortium that in 1997 led the exploration and export of oil in Sudan. Its glass sides and dramatic, curved bullet shape made it a distinctive building. The design was meant to be iconic, with the steel structure and glazing shaped to resemble a flame representing the oil blaze in the fields.” Another local architect, Arwa Ahmed, said: “Since its construction, there was hardly a photo, painting or a graphic design piece about Khartoum that did not include this building in its skyline. It had become a symbol of the region … I remember the day when I was an architectural student and our lecturer introduced us to the Alsunut project as a vision for new hope for the Sudan.”

Akram Elkhalifa: The tower lies in the heart of Khartoum in the area known as Al-Mogran (The Meeting Points) as it’s located at the confluence of the White and the Blue Nile rivers. It was one of the few high-rise buildings in the city and reflected the stylistic direction taken by the modern architecture in Khartoum in that era.
Amira Osman: As Hassan explained: “El Mogran was envisaged as a public-private partnership investment that would reshape the river banks southward to Al Sunut Forest. This spectacular and unique natural site was to accommodate a new financial district.”
Tallal Abdalbasit Saeed: I feel quite torn seeing Al-Sunut buildings aflame. It is a kind of bittersweet feeling. These buildings were very expensive (about US$3,500 per square metre a month to build). They’ve housed valuable businesses. On the other hand, for many these buildings represent symbols of corruption and alienation. Although they had started to contribute to the verticality of Khartoum’s skyline – a contrast to its historical horizontal (flat) nature – they expressed a yearning for the imagery of the oil-rich Gulf cities. These buildings do not have much architectural value in themselves. They have no regard for the harsh semi-desert climatic conditions of the city. They occupy a very important location that was privatised without public consultation. The site possesses ecological, social and historical significance and characteristics that should have been kept public and accessible. I hope this destruction gives us a new opportunity to correct those approaches in rebuilding Khartoum.
What does this say about rebuilding the city?
Akram Elkhalifa: The destruction of major buildings exposes the scale of the conflict’s impact on civilians and the country’s infrastructure. It visualises the future of the city if the war continues.
The tower engulfed in flames. AFP via Getty Images
Amira Osman: I discussed this with Arwa. As a young architect still living and working in the city her insights are valuable: “I catch myself trying to analyse each picture I see of a building affected by the war. Trying to assess the damage done and the time and effort needed to rebuild! In most of the pictures I saw, the damage was superficial and I could imagine the ease of repairs. However, the videos of the tower burning shocked me as I started to comprehend the scale of the damage.”
Tallal Abdalbasit Saeed: The city will need years of rebuilding. One hopes that in the rebuilding, the mistakes of the past will be corrected.
Amira Osman: In the past, authorities have demonstrated an inability to plan for “sharing cities”. Khartoum’s urban planning had been the cause of anger and protest. There has been no attempt to be inclusive or alleviate urban poverty.
What other major buildings have been destroyed?
Amira Osman: The images we see are mostly bits and pieces of videos shared by either of the warring parties. From these images, it seems that the new presidential palace was affected as well as the Ministry of Justice building, the Sudanese Standards and Metrology Organization Tower, the Sahil and Sahra Tower, the Khartoum International Airport, the Sudan National Museum…
The systematic destruction has included hospitals, libraries, markets, power stations, water stations, university and research facilities, schools. The basic services of life are apparently deliberately targeted, forcing people to flee. By July 2023, about 3 million individuals (over 600,000 households) were believed to have been internally displaced. By September that had escalated to an estimated 7 million.
Akram Elkhalifa and Tallal Abdalbasit Saeed: Thousands of buildings have been looted and robbed. Many of the buildings are now used as bases for military activities. Buildings and neighbourhoods that form the architectural and cultural heritage of Khartoum face the risk of being destroyed.
What’s happening to people and their homes?
Akram Elkhalifa: In some areas Khartoum has become a ghost city. When there’s no bombing or firing there’s just the sound of silence. Civilians are living in seriously unsafe situations – they face being caught in the crossfire, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, enforced disappearance and widespread looting.
Read more: Khartoum: the creation and the destruction of a modern African city
Amira Osman: This is what Arwa told me: “People’s homes are being taken over as military bases. The few homes that are not affected by the clashes are being looted. In some homes even doors, windows and toilet fixtures were robbed. My family home east of the city was used by soldiers as a place to stay. My aunt’s home is being used as a field hospital.” Hassan added: “After the militia loses its military bases due to airstrikes, they invade the nearby neighbourhoods, forcing residents to leave abruptly. Some of the stolen cars and belongings are said to be exported to neighbouring countries like Chad, Niger and Libya.”
A final thought. I can’t help thinking about how many residents of Khartoum hoped that the protest sites of the 2018 people’s revolution that toppled Omar al-Bashir could have become commemorated sites marking a brighter future for Sudan.
Instead, authorities eradicated one of the main protest sites. Now the destruction of one public space has escalated to the destruction of the whole city. The trauma is of such a magnitude that it will take many years for us to fully comprehend it.",Khartoum’s burning tower: architects on the destruction of a city – and what it’ll take to rebuild,arts + culture
"Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park lies at the centre of Ghana’s capital, Accra. Recently renovated, it is dedicated to the memory of Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of Ghana’s independence struggle and its first president. Marking the spot of his final resting place at the park is a massive statue.
The statue has been continuously contested since its original commission in 1956 and its unveiling at the first anniversary of independence in 1958. As a social anthropologist who has researched and written about Kwame Nkrumah themed monuments, I have explored the contradiction that generally characterises monuments: built as lasting memories, they remain embedded in social and political conflict.
Nkrumah is heralded as one of the most influential African political leaders of the modern era. His vision of a liberated and united African continent influenced politics on the continent in the 1950s and 1960s. But that’s only one view of a man who was deposed in a coup in 1966 and died in exile in 1972.
In Ghana, there was vociferous criticism of “personality cult” and “hero worship”. Alongside presentations of him as the country’s “redeemer” were descriptions of him as a “dictator”.
The idolisation of Nkrumah began even before the country became independent. It had all the hallmarks of a new nation state trying to establish a charismatic national “founder” to stabilise its creation. But, as I have shown, Nkrumah’s story shows both the limits and dangers of doing this.
These debates have been matched by unfolding dramas around various efforts to commemorate him – before and after his death. Attitudes have shifted from straightforward veneration to confrontation and destruction and, finally, to more subtle forms of remembrance.
The birth of a monument
With thoughts of Ghana soon celebrating 25 years of independence, then military ruler Ignatius Kutu Acheampong intended to publicly honour the memory of Nkrumah. The deposed leader had passed away in 1972, in exile. After his overthrow, several of his statues and images had been destroyed by the military government. His memory was taboo.
Acheampong discussed the possibility of creating a mausoleum, adorned with an imposing new statue, on the grounds where the ex-president had declared independence. The statue was commissioned in Italy but before it could be erected the Acheampong government was toppled by Flight Lieutenant Jerry J. Rawlings in 1979.
In addition, the continued economic crisis militated against any large-scale investment in the monumental landscape.
The memorial project was finally realised in 1992 based on the design of Ghanaian architect Don Arthur. The heart of the memorial is the mausoleum, surrounded by water basins, with fountains and figures of Asante elephant-horn blowers that traditionally accompany royal processions.
The mausoleum stands in a landscaped park that is successively greened by commemorative trees planted by important international visitors. It is complemented by a museum that exhibits a collection of Nkrumah memorabilia. These include the famous smock he wore to declare independence, his desk at the seat of government and numerous photographs.
The mausoleum itself, made of Italian marble, evokes a gigantic tree stump, but also draws on the imagery of Egyptian pyramids, the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower. The whole ensemble celebrates Nkrumah as a kind of chief. The shining large bronze statue erected in front of the mausoleum shows Nkrumah clad in royal kente cloth, not the humble smock of the original sculpture.
Opponents of Rawlings regarded the mausoleum project as an attempt to exploit the growing nostalgia for Nkrumah in his electoral campaign and to style himself and his party as worthy heirs of Nkrumah’s ideas. Another major motivation behind the project was to show the world that Ghanaians, after many years of neglect, respected Nkrumah as a great African leader. This was actually the first time since his overthrow that Nkrumah was publicly commemorated with such splendour. The memorial park conferred on Nkrumah an indisputable place in the national narrative.
This status, however, did not mean that his political legacy was now without contest. When the anti-Nkrumah New Patriotic Party won the elections in 2000, they, unlike the 1966 coup-makers (who removed all images and monuments of Nkrumah), made no attempts to destroy the Nkrumah monument. However, the new government found other ways to correct, or at least complement, Nkrumah-centred nationalist narratives.
For instance, in the course of preparing for the golden jubilee of Ghana’s independence in 2007, the John Kufuor administration created a series of monuments that commemorate the political heroes of his party, the New Patriotic Party. Most prominently, J.B. Danquah, Nkrumah’s most noted political opponent, was honoured by a renovated sculpture at a busy traffic roundabout in the capital.
This proliferation of historical monuments can be read as an attempt to neutralise the commemoration of Nkrumah. This was done not by eliminating existing statues of him, but rather by reducing Nkrumah’s status to being only one of several national founders.
Strong memories remain
For the masses of Ghanaian students and foreign tourists who come to the park, the statue of a triumphant Nkrumah has become the dominant icon of the national hero and of Ghana’s independence. It has been reproduced over and over again on thousands of private photographs, and is marketed on postcards, posters, calendars, T-shirts, bags, towels, tea cups and similar souvenirs.
However, there are still limits to the depoliticisation of Nkrumah’s memory. Heated debates over whether Nkrumah was a “democrat” or a “despot” flare up periodically. National heroes, as the case of Nkrumah shows, can divide people just as much as they can unite.
Developing the mausoleum into an attractive tourist site, as happened in the renovation and re-inauguration of the park in 2023, adds another intriguing twist to the long history of the commemoration of Kwame Nkrumah – another attempt at depoliticising and nationalising memory.","Kwame Nkrumah: memorials to the man who led Ghana to independence have been built, erased and revived again",arts + culture
"In African cultures, the names given to children play an important role because they are often laden with meanings.
As a team of professors of literature, linguistics and onomastics (the scientific study of names and naming practices) we have shown in our research that the names parents give their children at birth can help us make sense of many things, including a family’s heritage and events in history.
Our most recent research paper analyses naming practices in Zimbabwe. It shows that Zimbabweans in the former British colony in southern Africa still often choose English names like Robert or Oliver over traditional ones like Vulindlela or Ntombenhle.
We conclude that names make it possible to understand the effects of colonialism and, in more recent years, the importance placed on restoring tradition. Embracing traditional practices matters as a way of keeping culture alive so that people can benefit from its knowledge.
Relics of colonialism
English-language names are abundant in Zimbabwe today. This could be one of the effects of the introduction of colonial languages and the displacement of indigenous languages. It demonstrates the difficulty of erasing the mentalities acquired in the colonial era.
We argue that British missionaries and colonisers “invaded” the “mental” space of the colonised and significantly changed the way Zimbabwean people use English and indigenous languages to name children.
Read more: How schools use language as a way to exclude children
“Typical” English names maintain a connection to a time when schoolchildren would often be given new, English names to mould them into British-like subjects.
Names in literature
Literary works can help us better understand names and naming patterns. Celebrated Zimbabwean author Yvonne Vera’s novel Butterfly Burning, for example, shows how names in Zimbabwe’s Ndebele language were progressively abandoned for English ones.
This change saw the use of abstract English names such as Gilbert instead of meaningful indigenous ones like Vulindlela, a boy’s name meaning “open the way” that expresses the parents’ hope that the child will bring good fortune to the family.
This cultural shift can be considered a form of erasure of a significant component of indigenous cultures. Such erasure is part of the larger-scale losses suffered through colonisation. This cultural loss was never fully recovered even in the decades after independence in Zimbabwe in 1980.
Naming practices in Zimbabwe today
There’s evidence that, in the last couple of decades, parents in Zimbabwe use both English and indigenous languages to name their children. Naming practices from colonial times live on.
In Zimbabwe these English names fall into different categories. There are typical English names like Ashley and Jean. There are also biblical names, like Isaac and Peter. We also find Africanised biblical names such as Jowero (Joel) and Mateu (Matthew).
And then there are “Zimbabwean English” names like Decent and Choice: English names translated from indigenous names. Zimbabwean English names offer an opportunity to understand the potential of drawing from traditional African knowledge – where names record personal experiences and aspirations – through using English. Colonial entanglements reveal adaptations of traditional forms.
We also notice “religious” names translated literally from indigenous names – like Takomborerwa (We have been blessed). The alterations are clear effects of colonialism, emanating from the establishment of Christianity. Examples of these “vernacular Christian names” include the Shona language names Tapiwanashe (We have been given by God), Tawananyasha (We have found God’s grace) and Anotidaishe (God loves us).
Biblical English names and Africanised biblical names
Like the English language, Christianity was at the heart of colonialism in Africa, spread through missionaries. This saw the increased popularity of biblical English names in Zimbabwe.
“Africanised biblical” names are related to Christian biblical names, adapted to “fit” indigenous language rules of grammar. Since the translated Bible remains an “English book”, Africanised biblical names do not become indigenous names, rather they remain biblical English names. For instance the Shona name Ruka is adopted from the biblical name Luke. Ruka is simply a Shona version of Luke.
Zimbabwean English names
Besides typical English, biblical English and Africanised biblical names, a large category of Zimbabwean English names are popular at present. These have also been called “non-standard” English names to disrupt the dominance of British English that created tropes like “hilarious names”. Examples of such names are Bastard and Darling – used in Zimbabwean novelist NoViolet Bulawayo’s award-winning novel We Need New Names.
The majority of Zimbabwean English names are literal translations of indigenous personal names, illustrating the enduring power and assumed prestige of the language of Empire. At the same time, translating indigenous names shows a clear interest by Zimbabweans in retaining indigenous values and naming patterns.
Refashioning imperial debris
In these uses of English names with and without indigenous equivalents, the long-term effects of the language of colonisation are made visible.
Read more: How the history of Zimbabwe played out on the country's cricket fields
So, on the one hand, these names tell a story about how indigenous ways of life were looked down on and how this colonial disdain still influences people’s naming choices. This could be a result of an internalised colonial mentality in which the English language continues to index the power and prestige that it accumulated through the violence of the colonial era.
On the other hand, we see how these Zimbabwean English names draw on longstanding indigenous traditions and creatively reclaim the English language for local purposes. From this perspective, we interpret naming trends in Zimbabwe as a creative refashioning of imperial debris that helps keep traditional knowledge alive.",Zimbabwean names are still haunted by the ghosts of colonialism,arts + culture
"The hit song Calm Down by Nigerian music star Rema (Divine Ikubor) continues to make headlines after its release in February 2022. The song, featuring US singer and actress Selena Gomez, became the first African-led track to reach a billion clicks on music streaming service Spotify in the same week as it won an MTV Video Music Award in the inaugural Best Afrobeats category.
But its impact has been about more than just entertainment, it’s also been political. And that has a lot to do with an online dance video for the song going viral, the Calm Down Dance Challenge choreographed by Cameroonian dancer Loïc Reyel.
On 8 March 2023, five teenage girls uploaded on social media a video of themselves performing the challenge, which features choreography for the first verse of the Afrobeats hit.
The girls were following people across the world who’ve made this dance challenge go viral for over a year by uploading videos of themselves dancing to it. With one difference, though: they were dancing in Iran, where it is forbidden to dance in public, especially without the mandatory headscarves for women.
By 10 March, the 40-second video had gained enough notoriety for the dancers to be rounded up by authorities and made to apologise publicly. But the genie was out of the bottle. Their video is still circulating across social media.
They were part of a series of challenges to the Islamic Republic of Iran, rippling outwards from the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. The Iranian woman was arrested for refusing to wear the headscarf in the prescribed manner.
Iranian girls dance to Calm Down.
Six months later, Iranian girls were still protesting – but now through a song by an African singer and a dance routine by an African dancer.
A winning combination of music, movement and technology can make dance routines go viral. This was seen, for example, during the COVID pandemic with the South African music and Angolan choreography to the hit song Jerusalema by Master KG.
In popular culture singers are known by name, but dancers largely remain unacknowledged. So who first dreamt up the Calm Down dance that has catapulted from microblogging fame to joyous defiance of a notoriously repressive regime?
The choreography
On 7 March 2022 the now-famous choreography for Calm Down first appeared on the TikTok handle Loïc Reyeltv. The poster was Cameroon-born, Montreal-based Loïc Ngumele Sipeyou, known professionally as Loïc Reyel. He’s the founding director of Afro Vybz dance school and in the video he’s dancing with five students.
Their short routine coordinates expressive hand gestures with footwork drawn from African street dance styles that globally circulate through teachers such as Loïc. Think Ivorian coupé-decalé, Nigerian shoki, Ghanaian azonto, Angolan kuduro … These local responses to pan-African electronic music constantly combine with Caribbean and African American dance styles to remember and resist the traumas of enslavement, colonialism and policing of the Black body.

Loïc used these rich resources to interpret a song that had been released less than a month earlier on Rema’s debut studio album Rave and Roses.
In a phone conversation with me, as part of my ongoing research into West African dance forms, Loïc described it as “a very easy song” he “felt immediately connected with” and could “really move to”.
As Calm Down began topping European charts, Loïc’s kinetic response began attracting social media users worldwide. His dance challenge video has, to date, 215,000 likes and 10,500 shares.
Loïc’s video is not just shared; countless people of all ages and nationalities learn his steps, record their performances and upload them on social media. From Pakistan to Kenya and now Iran, in solo, couple and group formats, in salwars and sweatpants, hoodies and baseball caps, by hijab-wearers and hijab-rejectors, the videos keep coming – as this TikTok compilation shows. A remixed duet version between Rema and US singer Selena Gomez gave the song a second peak in September 2022. Meanwhile, Loïc’s dance challenge continues to captivate globally.
The song
This magic arises from Rema’s vocal delivery. His melodic genius transforms the popular B major key with a complex progression of chords. The lyrics twist together the recognisable and near-indecipherable. In the song words and phrases like “vibes”, “calm down” and “lockdown” meet the syntax and vocabulary of Nigerian pidgin (“no dey do yanga” and Jamaican dancehall (“shawty”). The fizzy drink Fanta is crafted into an evocative image of desirability (“girl you sweet like Fanta-ooh”). The song pours out like chilled Fanta bubbling up with the unforgettable “lo-lo-lo-lo-ve-ve-ve-ve-ve”. Its laid back approach decolonises the English language, releasing it for the world to use.
Rema’s official video increased the song’s appeal by visualising its storyline. His pursuit of a “hot yet humble” girl in her yellow dress draws viewers into urban Africa’s interiors and streetscapes. Its plotline is universal: a couple struggling to emerge from a group. Loïc’s choreography enhances this story. Its hand gestures bring out the meanings swirling around the words. At the same time, legs, waist and pelvis spell out another story: the transformation of African kinetic (movement) codes into street dance styles that became the weaponry of dispossessed youth around the Afro-Atlantic rim.
Dance of joy
Says Loïc:
No matter what our people went through in the past, we are always able to dance with joy.
The body’s alegropolitics – its capacity to activate memories of enjoyment as well as trauma by creolising (bringing together) multiple cultural strands – characterises both Rema’s song and Loïc’s choreography. This enhances their interaction as well as, in Loïc’s words, the dance challenge’s “amazing success”. Its unstoppable popularity illustrates what ethnomusicologist Elina Djebbari calls videochoreomorphosis: the processes by which dance, using the body, remains meaningful in the digital age through dancers’ innovative interaction with the music video format.

In responding to Loïc’s challenge, the Iranian girls similarly remake themselves through video. Flamboyantly rejecting cultural isolation for kinetic cosmopolitanism, they step into a dynamic global culture as its active contributors. They flawlessly reproduce the sometimes tricky choreography and they add a special closing note: a spectacular booty shimmy. This runs counter to Islamic-influenced codes of female propriety but draws on the sacred “ontology of the twerk” in Africanist movement cultures.
Dreaming together for freedom
“Dance is freedom,” says Loïc, while acknowledging that these culturally coded moves are often misinterpreted by non-Africans as sexualised. The Iranian girls sense the power of such ambivalence. Looking back while shimmying, and ending with a flamboyant kick towards the lens in classic Afrobeat style, they shift the status quo.
They dance in the massive urban jungle of Ekbatan, a housing project built in Tehran during the 1970s. In the midst of brutalist concrete, hopes blossom through unpredictable confederations.
Rema sent a message in response to the video by the five girls:
To all the beautiful women who are fighting for a better world, I’m inspired by you, I sing for you, and I dream with you.
For Loïc, in the meanwhile, the Iranian dancers have confirmed his purpose in life: “to change the world through African dance. I’m closer to my goal.”

"At its premiere in 1913, Igor Stravinsky and Vaslav Nijinsky’s Rite of Spring shocked audiences and divided critics. The ballet centred around a straightforward yet brutal narrative – a community selects a sacrificial victim, a virgin who will be martyred to their fertility god to secure a good harvest. The plot, however, was not what scandalised Parisian theatregoers.
Every aspect of the performance transgressed western classical traditions. Stravinsky’s score re-imagined Russian folk music through a complex web of harmonies and constantly changing tempo. Nijinsky’s choreography abandoned ballet technique – his dancers had turned-in feet, curved spines and performed percussive stomps. And Nikolai Roerich’s set and costume designs were influenced by the folk art of Central Asia.
The ballet became a symbol of modernity, a bold vision of the future that was steeped in a global heritage.
Trailer for Dancing at Dusk - A moment with Pina Bausch’s The Rite of Spring.
Sixty years later, in the German city of Wuppertal, Pina Bausch’s version had a similar cultural impact, influencing generations of dancers to follow. Bausch’s remarkable staging covered the floor in a thick layer of soil, creating the impression of a devastated wasteland. Her intricate and relentless choreography required intense effort from the cast who, by the end, transformed the earth into a sweaty mud bath. The result was a visceral power play between men and women, a timeless morality tale about the consequences of misogynistic violence.
Bausch’s Rite was a great success and it became one of her best-known works. Throughout the four decades that she directed her radical independent company, Tanztheater Wuppertal, Bausch devised a new language of dance that departed from previous techniques and styles. The company diversified as it grew, taking in members from six continents, different generations and a much broader range of body types than is usually seen in the dance world.
After Bausch’s death in 2009, a foundation was established in her name, dedicated not only to preserving her legacy, but also expanding its reach. The Pina Bausch Foundation has authorised various dance companies to perform her work, including English National Ballet and Staatsballett Berlin. However, its collaboration with Senegalese choreographer Germaine Acogny offers a much more innovative approach.
For the first time, an ensemble has been created specifically for the purposes of dancing Bausch’s Rite of Spring. This staging, currently touring internationally, is performed by an all-African cast. Thirty-eight dancers from 14 countries breathe new life into now canonical choreography. Crucially, they also highlight the ongoing lack of African representation on theatrical stages.
Modern dance is global
From its very beginnings, modern dance has drawn inspiration from – and, too frequently, appropriated – cultures across the globe. American pioneer of modern contemporary dance, Isadora Duncan (1877-1927) referenced the philosophy and aesthetics of ancient Greece. The German pioneer of expressionist dance and dance therapy, Mary Wigman (1886-1973), was fascinated by the theatre and dance traditions of Asia. And American choreographer Martha Graham (1894-1991) incorporated Native American rituals into her works.

Yet there is a more complex history exemplified by artists such as Michio Ito (1892-1961), a Japanese dancer whose performances garnered the appreciation of audiences across Europe and the US, Uday Shankar (1900-1977), an innovator of Indian modern dance and Katherine Dunham (1906-2006), who researched traditional dances of the Caribbean.
Modern dance has always been global. Yet a problem with representation persists – and African dancers remain especially marginalised both on stage and in dance writing. The erroneous belief that modern dance has simply failed to take hold in the African continent erases a rich creative legacy.
A unique collaboration
Germaine Acogny and Pina Bausch’s careers ran in parallel. Both women studied abroad before bringing their expertise back to their home countries. Acogny caught the attention of Senegalese president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, who sent her to work with the acclaimed choreographer Maurice Béjart in Belgium.
Senghor and Béjart helped her to establish Mudra Afrique, the first school of contemporary dance in Senegal’s capital city, Dakar. However, Acogny became increasingly frustrated by the curriculum’s focus on western techniques and her desire to create a home for African modern dance led her to open École des Sables in 2004.
Dancers perform Rite of Spring. Pina Bausch Foundation
This seaside dance school was the locus for the Rite of Spring ensemble, who rehearsed with members of Bausch’s company for months to get under the skin of her choreography. Original touring plans were put on hold due to the pandemic. Thankfully, a visiting documentary filmmaker captured a final rehearsal on the beach at Toubab Dialaw, immediately before the country went into lockdown.
The resulting film reached global audiences at a time when live theatre seemed a distant prospect and, for many, was an important introduction to the culture of modern dance in Africa.
The company’s performances have brought rave reviews, including a sold-out run at the 2023 Edinburgh International Festival. Nonetheless, this raises a complex question. After a century of cross-cultural exchange and the global expansion of the art form, should it take a western “classic” to raise the profile of African modern dance? Sincere reflection is required on the power structures that govern dance as a global enterprise and determine whose work ends up being seen.

"Netflix’s recently released film Jagun Jagun (The Warrior) is set in pre-colonial Nigeria and follows the story of a feared warlord named Ogunjimi. While playing out in the past, it is steeped in contemporary universal cultural, political and socio-economic realities.
The first 15 minutes of the movie establishes that the story is centred on a young man called Gbotija who decides to train as a fighter under the leadership of a powerful and revered warrior, Ogundiji, son of Ogunrogba. Ogundiji is a ruler unto himself. The first couple of scenes accentuate the ingredients required for a would-be warrior, such as courage, determination and focus to succeed.
Gbotija, determined to become a mighty warrior, joins an elite army, encounters a manic warlord and discovers the love of a woman.
As a theatre professor, author, playwright, and film scholar I follow the output of Nollywood. Nigeria’s thriving film industry is increasingly attracting higher budgets and producing films of high screen value. Jagun Jagun is one such well produced films.
Is it any good?
The film’s art direction and visual and special effects are impressive. The fight choreography is noteworthy, the setting and scenography well thought out and the costume work is strong. The transitions are right on cue and seamless.
If I have to compare this movie with Anikulapo (2022) by Nigerian film-maker Kunle Afolayan, apart from having a lot in common in their deep roots in Yoruba epic narrative, I will simply say both creative efforts are from scions of veteran practitioners of the art on stage and on screen, namely the late Adeyemi Afolayan (Ade Love) and Adebayo Salami (Oga Bello), who also starred in this movie as one of the kings. Ade Love was an actor, director and producer. Kunle Afolayan is his son. Ade Love died in 1996 at 56 and was one of the early pioneers of such epic films as Ajani Ogun (1976) and Ija Ominira (1979).

The Ifa connection
Both Jagun Jagun and Anikulapo draw on the Ifa Corpus. This is why the Ifa Corpus remains a literary reference in Yoruba theatre and films. Ifa is an ancient religion and a complex system of divination conceptualised many centuries ago by the Yoruba people of west Africa. Ifa Yoruba religion is based on oral literature scriptures known as Odu Ifa or the Ifa Corpus. It is the blueprint of life used to guide humanity towards the manifestation of their destiny in a positive way. It provides guidance on how to make good decisions and how to proceed through uncertain times.
The lead actor, Femi Adebayo, has been helped on this path by vintage actor and Ifa priest Yemi Elebuibon.
Jagun Jagun adds to the growing number of recent films having major cultural prestige and eulogising Nigeria’s robust, heroic, creative and daring heritage in war, bravery, royalty, and the need for territorial protection.
Jagun Jagun official trailer.
Relevant story
Those looking at the story from a historical point of view should turn their binoculars to the recent happenings around our global village and its war mongering and wanton destruction.
Ogundiji can be heard in one scene discussing how the white men have just sent him some highly sophisticated weapons and he is going to try then out in his next escapade. The film therefore interrogates and explores some issues that I find universal, even though steeped in African and specifically Yoruba canons. It brings to mind, for instance, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the gathering of world powers, represented by kings who are propped on the throne by the likes of Ogundiji.
It also brings to mind the art and business of mercenaries like the Wagner groups of our current realities.
The movie also speaks to Nigerian politicians and rulers who hide their own children abroad for safekeeping, mentoring and tutelage while deploying children and relatives of other citizens as cannon fodder in senseless wars and acts of aggression, before, during and after electioneering.
The film’s two love stories between Ajitoni, Wehinwo’s fiancee, and the rejected suitor, and Gbotija and Kitan are antithetical to how relationships are struck and sustained. Ajitoni does not want the man she is to be married to but loves another man. Kitan initiates a relationship with Gbotija as the man she chooses. A tale of conflicting affections that reflects the themes of the movie.
The new Nigerian cinema
Some critics of Jagun Jagun may see this movie as a Hollywoodisation or Chinese Kung Fu-nisation of Yoruwood, the other cinema in Nollywood, but it is also possible to see some cross-fertilisation. That is, it’s strongly influenced by art cinema like the films of US film-makers Scorsese and Coppola and others like 12 Monkeys and The Batman. I think, however, that movies will do well to explore cross-fertilisation more, possibly through upping budgets and taking Nigerian films to the next level, drawing new viewers.
Despite a staggering number of names of ancient kingdoms and too much focus on superficial historical references, it’s a really, really good movie. The plot is original and the direction is strong. Is this the present? Is this the past? Is there a future of Nollywood to be glimpsed in Jagun Jagun? I recommend you watch it so that you can engage in these debates.","Nigeria’s slick Netflix epic, Jagun Jagun, explores a rich past that also reflects the world today",arts + culture
"The sale of television rights is the prime source of revenue for footballing organisations worldwide, but is particularly critical to Africa. Yet the Confederation of African Football (Caf) keeps making headlines for sacking its broadcasting partners. It faces potential litigation for recently terminating a US$415 million deal with the Qatari-based beIN Sports, the second TV contract in four years that the governing body of African football has unilaterally scrapped. We asked sport communications and media expert Chuka Onwumechili to unpack why this is happening and what impact it has.
How important are TV rights to African football?
TV rights are particularly critical because alternative commercial revenues such as sponsorships and merchandising are more limited in Africa.
Access to these broadcasting deals provides critical funds to help grow and support African football at various levels, including administration and funding for national associations and players.
Moreover, most global football viewers familiar with the top African stars who play in Europe are unable to see these players featuring for their home countries without these broadcasting deals.
What was the beIN deal?
The deal was signed in 2017 and was to last 12 years, until 2028. It allowed three Caf competitions – the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), the Caf Champions League and the Caf Confederation Cup – to be broadcast live in 40 countries across the world, including the Middle East, Europe and the US.
The relationship between Caf and beIN Sports began in 2009. BeIN became Caf’s anchor partner after Caf’s disagreement with Lagardère Sports and Entertainment in 2019 and the termination of that contract. Caf has now terminated the beIN deal too.
Caf is now potentially left without a broadcast partner in key markets. This TV blackout is set to happen just a few months ahead of Afcon, Caf’s flagship tournament, which is due to be hosted by Côte d'Ivoire in January 2024. There are also World Cup qualifiers and continental club competitions scheduled soon.
How will this affect fans?
Fans all over the world will not be able to watch their heroes live on television. It will adversely affect interest in African football, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years.
How do Caf’s deals compare with global ones?
Caf’s deal with beIN is exclusionary: one major broadcaster has rights to all the big tournaments. Most global confederations allow competition among broadcasters, with each assigned a slice of a tournament. For example, in Europe the Champions League rights are divided among separate broadcasters. In other cases, different tournament in the region are each assigned to different broadcasters.

Caf’s approach of handing out one monopoly agreement was the crux of the Egyptian Competition Authority’s 2019 legal challenge to Caf’s media rights contract with Lagardère. As a result Caf cancelled the $1 billion deal with the French company, citing anti-competitiveness as one of the reasons. A subcontractor, SuperSport, also withdrew from the deal, leaving most of Africa unable to access important continental matches on TV. It reportedly cost Caf $50 million to get out of the Lagardère deal.
What happened in the latest case?
CAF claims contractual breach, including an alleged $80 million in unpaid debt from beIN.
But beIN is threatening to challenge Caf in court. It alleges that Caf made the decision to cancel without following its own internal processes.
Read more: The four big challenges facing Patrice Motsepe, Africa's new soccer boss
The company believes it is owed the $80 million it is withholding from paying Caf, arguing it has suffered the impact of Afcon being postponed twice at the last moment – first due to COVID-19 and then due to weather – and that Caf has so far dismissed any attempts to reassess the value of the deal. (In similar situations at other confederations, deals were reassessed – such as Sky Sports receiving a $213.5 million rebate from the English Premier League because of COVID disruptions.)
BeIN also says that Caf’s 2022 announcement of a new Africa Super League club tournament led to the undervaluing of the deal.
Are broken deals like this unusual in world football?
No. The Asian Football Confederation cancelled media rights with Eleven Sports for restructuring its Asian operation. The confederation also terminated a deal with China’s LeSports for falling behind in payments. In 2020, the South American Football Confederation sued TV Globo for $120 million over unpaid fees.
Read more: The African football TV blackout could last for a while
But Caf’s two contract cancellations are based on different reasons: violation of anti-competition laws and a dispute over contract value.
How should Caf change the way it deals with TV rights?
Caf must now look to negotiate new deals that are similar to those negotiated by other confederations. For instance, there could be separate broadcasters for each of the continent’s top competitions, including the new Africa Super League.
New deals should avoid monopoly agreements that drastically affect the coverage of all continental games during contract disagreements or renegotiations.",African football fans won’t be able to watch the big matches on TV – what went wrong and how to fix it,arts + culture
"Somalis are natural-born critics, yet for over six decades Axmed Naaji Sacad (Ahmed Naji Sa'ad) was almost unanimously revered. A household name in urban Somalia, the popular singer and poet has passed away at the age of 84 in London.
Venerated as an elder of the country’s cultural life, Axmed Naaji Sacad Cali Naasir was not merely a singer, composer and musician who played guitar, lute, mandolin, piano and violin, he was also a radio host, a playwright and a poet.
First known for his love songs like Garan Waaye (I Couldn’t Know), he would later become famous for patriotic songs such as Dalkeygow (Oh My Country). Poems are commonly set to music in Somalia. Naaji mostly performed a Banaadiri genre of Somali poetry – of the Benadiri people – although he also worked in other genres.
As an interdisciplinary scholar of Somali anthropology, history and politics, I have followed Axmed Naaji Sacad’s career since my childhood. He leaves behind a body of work that wove together the Somali people’s political struggles and socio-economic realities, entrenching himself in public consciousness.
Early years
Born in 1939 in Belaajo Carab (the Arab village) in the Shibis neighbourhood of Mogadishu, Naaji was Somali-Yemeni in origin but never identified himself other than as a Somali. His family had lived for generations in southern Somalia, where his father owned a farm and worked as a trader. From precolonial times, Somali-Yemeni traders were the suppliers of food and clothes to rural areas in south-central Somalia.
Naaji was born into an era of Italian colonialism in Somalia and, later, the wider Horn of Africa.
In the early 1950s, when the country began on the road to independence, he was registered with a government school to study Arabic and Italian. It was there that he honed his singing talent. His teachers taught him Arabic and Somali songs praising the newly-fashioned Somali flag, officially hoisted for the first time in 1954.
The Somali Youth League was the leading nationalist movement during the era of decolonisation. Naaji would go with his fellow students to their weekly meetings to entertain the attendees with song.
Young man
As a student, he liked to listen to the songs of luminaries like Sufi Ali and Qaasim Hilowle Liibaan, whose music was characterised by the combination of Arabic and Indian styles of poetry. His dream was to reach their level of popularity.
Read more: The beauty and brilliance of Baxsan, one of the most popular Somali singers of all time
Axmed Naaji also listened to Radio Mogadishu, one of the few places people could hear newly-released songs. He drew further inspiration from the local Banaadiri music bands that staged performances at venues used by Banaadiri political parties.
Driven by a desire to transform Somali songs, he joined a popular local band called Luna Somala (Somali Moon). They would release songs on Radio Mogadishu every Sunday, the official day of rest under an Italian regime tasked by the United Nations to prepare Somalis for independence.
The new Somali self-government in 1956 would encourage the evolution of modern popular culture, with artists like Axmed Naaji poised to make their names.
Radio Mogadishu
In 1961 Naaji was among the singers chosen, after an exam, to work for Radio Mogadishu. His time as a radio show host changed his life. People came to know him both on the airwaves and on the streets of Mogadishu: he worked on radio in the mornings and with local music bands in the evenings. He co-established his own band, Shareero, to entertain people in local bars and at community weddings.
When the Somali Republic was born from a merger of northern and southern regions in 1960, Naaji welcomed the team of singers from Radio Hargeysa in the north to Radio Mogadishu in the south. He was unparalleled in building a bridge between the south and the north, separately colonised by Italy and Britain, respectively. He benefited from the collaboration, which helped him make richer Somali music. He also performed Sudanese and western music while inspiring young broadcasters on their road to greatness.
At the same time, Naaji was staging plays at a small local theatre until the national theatre was built in 1967.
Coup
A bemused Axmed Naaji would recount where he was in the early hours of the morning of 21 October 1969 when the military regime came to power. The junta who staged the coup targeted Radio Mogadishu, sending soldiers to his home to get the keys for the studio. Seeing soldiers, his mother wept, believing that her son had done something wrong. He followed the soldiers’ instructions.
After nine years of failed democracy characterised by election fraud, a socialist-style revolution had been born in impoverished Somalia. The public largely welcomed the coup, rising up against the former civilian leaders. On the morning of the coup, Naaji and famed poet Cali Sugulle were tasked with preparing a song for broadcast on the radio. Sugulle composed it and Naaji voiced it:
Xooggii baa dadaalayoo, xukunkii dalka haystee, anna waan ku raacnaye, hambalyo diiran hooya… (The army has strived, taking over the rule of the country, and we concur with them, we offer them warm congratulations…)
It was the first time Naaji heard the word kacaan (revolution). During the golden era of the military regime in the early 1970s, he found a unique opportunity to display his talent. Buoyed by his growing popularity, he travelled far and wide to perform for Somali, African and international audiences.
Somali music reached a new peak in 1974 and Naaji was at the forefront of it. He believed that Somali musicians were as important as any others in the world. The new popular music was performed in the Somali language and he was a leading star of the new school, famous for his love songs.
Civil war
By the 1980s Somalia found itself on the brink again. An armed rebellion against President Mohamed Siad Barre would lead to civil war. When, in December 1990, the war finally reached Mogadishu, Naaji stepped back, composing nothing in support of either side.
He fled to Lafoole village outside Mogadishu, where his university professor brother lived and taught, and left for Yemen in May 1991. There he helped refugee Somali artists and began releasing songs calling for an end to the war and the restoration of a unified nation-state.

Before the civil war, Naaji was largely known for love songs. After the collapse of the state, he turned his focus to nationalistic, patriotic songs encouraging Somalis to create a new, better Somalia from the ashes.
He toured the world, visiting Somalia once in 2011 but living in exile in the UK. But through his patriotic poems like Soomaalaay Dalkaagii Mee? (Oh Somalis, Where Has Your Country Gone?), he contributed significantly to relentless efforts to create peace and reconciliation in Somalia. Sadly, he died without seeing that happen.
Thousands attended his funeral in the UK. In a more just world he would have been buried in his beloved Somalia, where he is regarded as an icon and a hero of the Somali people wherever they are in the world.","Somalia’s voice of hope: a tribute to Axmed Naaji, legendary singer and trailblazing composer",arts + culture
"The first book-length study of digital literature in Africa has attracted a lot of academic attention. African Literature in the Digital Age: Class and Sexual Politics in New Writing from Kenya and Nigeria considers the role of the internet and new media in finding and shaping new audiences for literature. We asked its author, former journalist, literature scholar, publishing editor of The New Black Magazine and associate professor of African studies, Shola Adenekan, about the book.
What prompted you to write this?
The book came out of my own experience of the internet, especially my interactions with writers and thinkers who became acquaintances and friends through email listservs (electronic mailing lists) and social media platforms. This began around the turn of this century, when I was working as a journalist in London. I noticed a growing trend of literature being published online by African writers, on blogs, African-owned websites, MySpace, and later Facebook and Tumblr. I decided to set up a website – The New Black Magazine – to publish, and in some instances republish, some of the new ideas being espoused by these new voices.
Boydell & Brewer
Their work seemed more organic than much of what was being published in print at the time. Organic in the sense that their primary audience was the emerging African digital public, and not the traditional publishers like Macmillan and Random House. Some of the pioneering thinkers and writers were women and queer Africans whose works were not deemed worthy by traditional publishers.
I remember Nigerian novelist Jude Dibia had a blog, as did Nigerian activist, photographer and author Sokari Ekine, blacklooks.org, which is unfortunately now defunct. Ekine’s blog was a cultural and literary network, where queer writers like Kenya’s Shailja Patel and Keguro Macharia, British Somali writer Diriye Osman and South African photographer and activist Zanele Muholi were congregating. Ekine is the ultimate networker, whose activism sheds light on queer Africa and its diaspora beyond the narratives of violence.
Another excellent digital networker was Professor Wambui Mwangi, one of the founders of Concerned Kenyan Writers, a listserv group on Gmail. She was the person who introduced me to many Kenyan writers and encouraged me to do a PhD and write a book about these exciting developments. This is why my book opens with a chapter on literary networks.
How has the internet shaped Kenyan and Nigerian literature?
The online space should be a starting point for any discussion of contemporary African writing. For example, some of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s earlier works were first published online. Kenyan writer Billy Kahora’s non-fiction ibook The True Story of David Munyakei grew out of a piece published online on Mwangi’s now defunct blog, the Diary of a Mad Kenyan Woman.
Apart from blogs, there were pioneering digital African magazines like African Writers, African Writing, Kwani and Chimurenga. They provided a platform to grow for many of today’s established voices. They also used listservs to hone their skills. Some African book publishers were active participants in these listservs. Today, there are dozens of online magazines, like Afreada, that publish exciting short stories.
What does this have to do with queer life?
If it seems that literary networks are somewhat centred on queer activists, it’s because many were at the forefront of digital African networks. Some left the continent for Europe and America due to homophobia, where they have also had to contend with racism and transphobia. Many other queer writers stayed behind to fight homophobia.
The online provides a space to articulate this experience and also to showcase that queer African life is more than violence. Queer Africans love, care and enjoy everyday routine things that heterosexual people enjoy. From blogs to online magazines, digital publications to social media platforms, queer activism in Africa has found a home in the digital space. Some of the most powerful writing on queer bodies and politics can be found here.
The queer is arguably at the very core of twenty-first century African literature. The works of Macharia, Ekine, Patel, Unoma Azuah and Romeo Oriogun constitute a starting point for theorising digital Africa. Their writing provides robust insight into the way in which queerness, politics and civil rights intersect. Additionally, privilege, visibility, marginalisation, omission and silence can all be articulated through an analysis of their work.
And where does class fit in?
The digital here is also arguably classed. There are millions of Africans who use the internet despite not being part of the educated professional middle class. But most – if not all – of the pioneers of the digital literary communities have a solid middle-class background. One of the main privileges of being middle class and a writer is that one is often asked to be a sort of cultural ambassador for the continent. This privilege also allows writers to speak to themes – such as sexuality – that have become taboo subjects in postcolonial Africa.
What do you hope you have achieved with the book?
I hope that the book will inspire others to not only write about African digital life but also to write about queer African life in all its totality.
Finally, let me revisit what I mentioned on in the final chapter in the book: there is a need to study Africa’s quotidian life. In addition to literary studies’ fixation with African spectacular, we should also be interested in the everyday rituals that are not rooted primarily in poverty, hunger, and war.

What does the digital space provide Africans beyond the accounts of everyday stigmatisation and suppression? The ordinary and the commonplace need to be privileged, because the quotidian is at the very foundation of African art. On social media, often times, things like dressing up, kissing, wearing make-up, taking children to school, laughing and dancing – things that we may not considered as important – are statements of African humanity, of its defiance and resilience, through which many Africans affirm their Africanness, their ethnic and national identities.","African Literature in the Digital Age: new book traces the role of the internet, queers and class",arts + culture
"Two African teams have made it through to the 20 countries playing across four pools in the final stages of the 2023 men’s Rugby World Cup: three-time champions South Africa (ranked 2nd in the world) and underdogs Namibia (ranked 21st). What are their chances and what is the state of rugby union in Africa? We asked rugby expert and coach Wilbur Kraak some burning questions.
What shape is South Africa in – can they win?
South Africa can do well for a few reasons. Key members of the coaching and support team, who helped South Africa win in the last World Cup, in 2019, are still there. And they’ve added new talent like Deon Davids for fresh ideas. They have lots of good players in different positions, so can make strong teams no matter who they choose. There are both experienced players and young talents, like Canan Moodie, Grant Williams and Kurt-Lee Arendse. Some of the players can play different positions, which is handy. It’s a team that does well when it has momentum, especially in areas like collisions and kicking. And leaders like team captain Siya Kolisi are important, particularly in tough games.
Read more: Rugby World Cup: will body mass play a role in taking the victors over the line?
But we need to remember a few things. South Africa’s players are older now, so they need good rest between matches. They’re in a demanding pool – including Ireland (ranked 1st in the world) and Scotland (5th). They should rotate the team in games against lower ranked sides like Romania and Tonga. All-rounder Manie Libbok’s skill in kicking goals is crucial. And the team must stay disciplined on the field and adjust to how referees interpret the laws. If these things are kept in mind then South Africa has a good chance of winning.
How do you rate Namibia?
Namibia’s goal is different from South Africa’s. I believe their main aim is to secure their first-ever win in the World Cup final stages, and it seems they might be targeting Uruguay for that opportunity. Namibia face a unique challenge because they’re in a difficult pool that includes hosts France and New Zealand (ranked 3rd and 4th in the world).
One common issue for second tier nations like Namibia is they don’t get enough chances to play highly competitive rugby. However, they recently had a tour of South America, which should help them prepare. To progress as a rugby nation, Namibia needs to focus on playing more competitive international matches, improving its club system, and ensuring consistency in player selections.
An advantage in this campaign is having two coaches, Allister Coetzee (part of South Africa’s 2007 World Cup-winning team) and Matthew Proudfoot (who contributed to South Africa’s 2019 success). Their experience will undoubtedly be a benefit.
What’s the state of the game in Africa?
The state of rugby in Africa is complex but promising. Africa is often referred to as rugby’s “sleeping giant” because of its vast potential. But there are several challenges that need to be addressed to fully harness this potential.
First and foremost, rugby in Africa requires substantial resources. This includes long-term funding to invest in grassroots development, improve facilities, and establish player development structures and coach-education programmes. Many African nations face financial constraints that limit such investment and will not be able to reach their potential.
While countries like Kenya have demonstrated their prowess in rugby sevens (a shorter version format with seven players a side), there’s room for growth in rugby union (the longer, traditional format with 15 players a side). Plus, improving the quality and representation of women’s rugby is an imperative for the whole continent. Through focused efforts and investment, African nations can rise to prominence in both formats and contribute to the global growth of rugby.
Another significant challenge is the limited number of qualified teams that can participate in major international tournaments, often because of fewer player numbers than international powerhouses. So only a few African teams stand a chance to qualify – like Zimbabwe (ranked 31st), Kenya (33rd), Uganda (42nd) and Senegal (56th), which were among the teams trying to reach the 2023 World Cup final stage. This can be frustrating, given the continent’s passion for the sport.
However, what’s encouraging is the willingness to learn and improve. Many African nations like Kenya, Zambia, Namibia and Uganda are eager to enhance their rugby programmes and competitive abilities. They’re open to partnerships, collaborations, and knowledge-sharing opportunities with more established rugby nations.
With the right investments and support, we may see more African teams making their mark on the international stage.
What factors will shape this year’s tournament?
The introduction of the bunker system (a dedicated space next to the field for television match officials) adds an intriguing dynamic. The use of technology is expected to have a significant impact on match outcomes and potentially ignite spirited debates.
Squad depth becomes pivotal, given the inevitability of injuries during the campaign. Teams with strong reserves and the ability to rotate players effectively have a distinct advantage.

Effective team leadership – from inspirational captains and experienced players making critical on-field decisions – will wield considerable influence. The ability to rebound swiftly from disappointments, losses or setbacks demonstrates a team’s resilience, underpinned by mental toughness and unwavering focus.
And then, expectations are building for a shift in the scoring dynamics. This year’s tournament may witness an increase in points, driven by improved attacking strategies, creativity and a willingness to take calculated risks. This promises more thrilling matches.
What does it take to be world champions?
While there are numerous factors that contribute to the success of championship rugby teams, I believe that five key elements stand out as vital. These are physical preparation; effective recovery strategies and player management; strong team cohesion; coaching tactics and strategies; and having X-factor players who can create opportunities out of seemingly nothing.","Rugby World Cup 2023: Africa’s hopes lie with South Africa and Namibia, for now",arts + culture
"Gender has a significant impact on the socio-economic, political and religious experiences of Ghanaians. For Akans, the country’s largest ethnic group, descent is traced through the maternal line. Property is transferred in this line too.
Mourning rituals are another area of life that’s shaped by gender in Ghana – as in many other cultures of the world.
In a recent paper, we explored the way Akan mourning rituals reflect the culture’s ideas about gender and reproduce social patterns.
Bereavement is gendered in Akan society: there are strict behavioural prescriptions for males and females. We argue that enacting and reproducing masculinity and femininity in these rituals may have negative health and psychological consequences for both men and women.
Our study is useful for therapists and counsellors to understand the impact of gender and culture when working with people who are dealing with grief and loss. Gender shapes how people make meaning of – and cope with – grief and loss in a specific social milieu.
Mourning, masculinity and femininity
The responsibilities of the principal cultural players of Akan death and mourning rituals are assigned according to gender. Males are the major players in organising and supervising the rites.
A key player is the lineage head (Abusuapanin), who is invariably male.
In Akan culture, the lineage head must be informed of all deaths occurring in the lineage. He must, in turn, inform the chief and other authorities of the polity (village or town) of all deaths in his lineage when they occur.
The second major player is the chief mourner, who is also usually a male. According to the customs and traditions of the Akan (and the law courts), the body of a deceased person belongs to the extended family into which one is born. The extended family decides at a meeting who the chief mourner should be.
The choice of chief mourner is very important because he makes decisions such as who will succeed the deceased and how to mourn fittingly. He oversees the proper organisation and execution of all rites pertaining to the death, particularly ensuring that the deceased has a funeral that befits his or her status attained in life and is compatible with the social standing of the family in the community.
Women’s roles in Akan mourning rites, though extensive, are secondary to those of men. Women have the responsibility to bathe and prepare the dead body to be laid in state for mourners to file past it. These women are usually members of the deceased’s family and are well versed in handling dead bodies.
Women also fulfil the role of professional mourners or wailers. Some Akan lineages engage the services of these wailers to add solemnity to the mortuary rites. At ordinary Akan funerals where they are absent, it is the women who lament and wail during critical stages of the process. Men are culturally discouraged from loud wailing and weeping. The expression ɔbarima nsu, which means “a man does/must not cry”, calls on Akan men to refrain from such behaviour to avoid labels of effeminacy.
This norm in the mourning process is consistent with a cultural practice that generally demands that Akan men must not publicly display their emotions, even in the face of adversity, pain and suffering.
In contrast, a woman who does not weep or lament at the death of a close relative is suspected of being a malevolent witch responsible for the deceased’s death. Thus, the Akan mourning rituals can be culturally and psychologically coercive and oppressive for women.
Cash donations have become an important part of Ghanaian funerals. Both men and women make donations. But the archetype is that men will donate large sums of money to the bereaved family while women announce the donations and heap appellations on the male donors. For example, the compliments that women lavish on men to acknowledge their cash or kind donations may include mo ɔpeafo (well done), mompene no na ɔyɛ ɔbarima amu (let all praise him for he is a real man indeed) and other special names such as ɔdenoho (the affluent or independent one).
The male donor, female announcer gender hierarchy at funerals is another instance of gender role (re)enactment and performance. When men demonstrate economic prowess at funerals and women remain on the fringes as announcers, they are both performing and reinforcing a culturally given gender hierarchy.
The burden of mourning for males and females
We concluded from our findings that Akan death and mourning rituals can be culturally and psychologically oppressive against men and women. In the case of women, this is due to the unfair power hierarchy and the patriarchal nature of Ghanaian society.
In the case of men, the cultural expectation that they be emotionally restrained in mourning may have health and psychological consequences. These could include depression, stress and suicide. The masculine requirement for men to resist crying during bereavement leaves men to suffer alone in silence when they experience emotional pain.

"Lindokuhle Sobekwa has been awarded South Africa’s 2023 FNB Art Prize. He becomes the first artist using documentary photography as his primary medium to win the prestigious competition.
Born in Katlehong in 1995, Sobekwa began learning photography skills in 2012, through the Of Soul and Joy photography education programme in Thokoza township, where his family had moved. He knew, as a young boy, that he thought in images, visualising what he experienced. Encountering cameras, he realised there was equipment – a small machine, a perforated roll of clear plastic, and a chemical reaction – able to externalise his thought processes.
Thokoza, like many settlements on the outskirts of South African towns and cities, exists because of colonial and apartheid spatial segregation. Black South Africans weren’t permitted to live in “whites only” residential areas, yet provided essential, low-paid labour for the city. They created accommodation from whatever materials they found to build shelter.
Lockdown. Lindokuhle Sobekwa
Though Thokoza is only 26km away from Johannesburg, the country’s commercial metropolis seems as distant as another planet. The destitution of many in townships, as well as the abiding commitment to one another – necessary for making life possible in precarious conditions – is evident in Sobekwa’s work.
A scholar of visual identities and the legacy of documentary photography, I met Sobekwa when he was awarded a scholarship to study at Johannesburg’s Market Photo Workshop in 2015. I’ve conducted numerous interviews about the development of his projects that I draw from here to consider his work.
I’ve been struck by Sobekwa’s clearly articulated goal: to represent Thokoza in ways that divert from how it was imaged in the 1980s, during apartheid – as a location of spectacular instances of violence against police, and each other, instigated by shadow government forces.
Lockdown. Lindokuhle Sobekwa
I interviewed him this year, about his upcoming book, I carry Her photo with Me. I was taken, again, by his ability to visually conceptualise the larger threads of South African history: migrations to urban areas for income, the violent separations of families, the disappearances of loved ones into the bowels of the gold mines.
These disruptions left wounds in family narratives that never healed. Photography became Sobekwa’s way to create a tentative, living connection with what was lost, to find a way forward. His exploration of internal struggles, and the external conditions that stamped his own family – all that which remains unspoken and unspeakable – makes his images dance with dimension and depth, full of ghosts and uncanny presences.
Interconnected stories
The two series that won him the FNB Art Prize – Lockdown and Ezilalini (The Country) – could not seem more different. While Lockdown follows life in Thokoza, Ezilalini is a journey to Tsomo in the Eastern Cape province, from where his grandfather and then his mother migrated. Apartheid forcibly corralled black South Africans to small territories, giving the arable land on which they once lived for generations to white farmers. Unable to make a living in these so-called homelands, many sought work as migrant labourers in the cities.
Ezilalini. Lindokuhle Sobekwa
Lockdown and Ezilalini are two interconnected narratives. The history that created Thokoza is the same one that displaced so many from the beautiful vistas with which Sobekwa reconnects, on his returns to the place in which the umbilical cords and bones of his blood relatives are buried.
Lockdown
During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, Sobekwa didn’t have much work. With places of business closed, income dried up for most people in townships. The safety directives heard around the world sounded comical for those living in close proximity in shacks. But it was no laughing matter.
Sobekwa lived alongside the surreal – officials hammering on about social distancing – and the hyper-reality of his day-to-day life: the intimacies, interdependencies, economic desperation, and fears of those around him.
He took his camera and began to narrate his place. Sobekwa’s photographs show the slow unfolding of how the pandemic exacerbated the violent conditions created by vast inequality. But there are also moments of beauty, love and community.
Lockdown. Lindokuhle Sobekwa
During twilight hours, a gaggle of young ones crane their necks to look through the iron bars of a tuckshop, perhaps getting cheap sweeties and crisps, a momentary escape from monotony. At night, friends gather around a charcoal brazier. On a hazy day, a young shepherd lies down on rough scrub at the foot of electricity pylons, surrounded by a thousand pieces of refuse. Two little girls walk through a corridor of lush flowers, deep in intimate conversation. A small fairytale, trapped in a larger global nightmare.
At times, people come to a breaking point amid the country’s never-ending electricity cuts. They come together to protest, running from the same terrifying machinery of the state as their elders did. In one photograph, a man has draped his body over the long metal pole of a streetlamp, forcefully brought down across a road strewn with hurled concrete. In this blissful moment of respite, he seems oblivious to the chaos around him.
Lockdown. Lindokuhle Sobekwa
Sobekwa and his family, living in a shack without running water or electricity, were disproportionately susceptible to the virus. Visiting his mother, he photographed her in her nightly ritual. She’s seated on the bed, shoulders slumped, deeply engrossed in reading her Bible, a ritual in which she had always found solace. Her worries are stilled for a moment by the promise and power of the Divine. She doesn’t notice Sobekwa is witness to her meditation. But we – witnesses to what his camera sees – can spot him in an oval mirror, wearing a mask to protect his mother from all with which he may have come into contact.
One of Sobekwa’s most powerful Lockdown photographs is of his partner’s family home in Thokoza during a power cut. Here, the mechanism of escape is the phone screen, and access to the internet. Each person is deeply focused on their own screen, which illuminates their faces. This is the moment the video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin brutally strangling George Floyd to death spread across the world. Sobekwa’s family were just as locked into the same horror, penned by white supremacy, as those in the US.
Lockdown. Lindokuhle Sobekwa
Ezilalini
Ezilaleni, starting in 2018, is an ongoing project motivated by Sobekwa’s returns to Tsomo, where his sister Ziyanda lies buried. He began to think about the way disappearances were part of his family’s narrative – his grandfather had left for Johannesburg, the city of gold, and never returned. His sister disappeared when he was very young.
Speaking with his grandmother, he was struck by her conceptualising of Johannesburg as a monstrous entity that “swallowed” her children. At the same time, he realised that those in Thokoza rarely spoke about the city as “home”. When someone asked Sobekwa where he was from, they meant where his ancestral clan had come from. This is how people resisted being swallowed, wholly digested by a city that represented hardship, labour, and little pleasure other than through mechanisms of escape.
Ezilalini. Lindokuhle Sobekwa
The return to Tsomo maps Sobekwa’s explorative attempts to imagine what it might mean to belong. In tracing the lineage of his clan, uMthimkhulu (Big Tree clan), and where their journeys may have taken them, he is tracing the fragmentations created by colonial taxation and land expropriation, by the extractive processes of mining for which apartheid spatial planning was designed. It’s a way of returning the disappeared to their home, to make a fragmented family whole again.
The land, as photographed by Sobekwa, carries the romance that other photographers before him have sought out and imaged. What I think is different is that the people present in his landscapes are persons, not decorative romances.
Reinventing tradition
Although the documentary tradition has a long history in South Africa, it has been associated with photography’s perceived ability to witness and expose injustices, perhaps moving audiences to demand change. It is rarely recognised for its potential as a creative medium.
Lockdown. Lindokuhle Sobekwa

"In the 1950s and 1960s, young Africans were assisted financially by their governments to study in western countries in the hope they would return to contribute to nation building. Individuals who qualified abroad and returned home formed the educated elites of immediate post-independent Africa.
Over the years, the demography of such migrants has changed to include professionals who after graduation at home move abroad in search of employment and remain there permanently. This loss of human talent and skills – the “brain drain” – is arguably one of Africa’s key developmental challenges.
The migration of highly skilled professionals such as doctors, nurses, engineers and academics from Africa has serious economic, political and social implications for development.
But there is another side to the migration of skilled people. That is “brain gain” – the return migration of professionals – and “brain circulation” – temporary migration of professionals between countries. This is not well documented, especially in the case of African countries.
This is the gap we sought to fill, using a case study of the late Ghanaian fashion designer, Kofi Ansah.
Ansah’s impact on Ghanaian fashion was immense because of the timing and context of his return in 1992. He had built a successful career for 20 years in the UK and the future looked promising. On the other hand, the country he returned to was undergoing profound political and economic transformation. Ghana was transitioning from military rule to a civilian government. Political tension was high, linked to an economic downturn following structural adjustment programmes adopted in the 1980s. But Ansah chose to relocate his budding career to Ghana.
His case demonstrates how the knowledge and expertise migrants gather through international career mobility can be converted into assets at an individual, national and international level. Returning migrants can transform traditional industries into modern, globalised ones.
Transforming Ghana’s fashion industry
We are researchers in sociology, African studies and geography who have been studying how internal and external migration and spatial context influence cultural and creative practice in Ghana. For the Kofi Ansah case study we interviewed 31 Ghanaian fashion designers whose career journeys had been directly and indirectly influenced by him. These interviews are supplemented by information from social media dedicated to Ansah and his works.
Kofi Ansah, who died in 2014, was from a creative family. His elder sister, Felicia Abban, was the official photographer of Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first president. His elder brother, Kwaw Ansah, is an acclaimed film writer, director and producer.
After completing his secondary education, Kofi enrolled in the Chelsea School of Art in the United Kingdom to study fashion design. He made his first fashion headline after he designed a beaded dress for Princess Anne. Subsequently, he worked for several successful British fashion brands, including Gerald Austin and Guy Laroche, before establishing his own studio in central London in 1980.
Despite his early success on the UK fashion scene, Ansah returned to Ghana in 1992 to get fresh inspiration and “try to show people that we can use our fabrics for other things … We just have to work on it and make it commercial,” he explained during an interview.
The way cloth was produced locally, using strip loom technology, limited the volume of production. And the conventional styling of clothes limited their patronage. These were some of the features Ansah sought to change.

Ansah transformed Ghana’s fashion industry in four areas:
Fabrics and design: His modern designs used African traditional cloth, such as kente and bogolanfini. Linked to these style changes was his collaboration with Woodin and the Ghana Textiles Production, two textile producing companies, to introduce the sale of fabric in single yards instead of the standard six yards. This made the cloth more accessible and functional. It led to the production of casual clothes, such as skirts, blouses, shirts, shorts and trousers, for men and women. He then introduced ready-to-wear clothing at Woodin.
Accessories: Ansah was also passionate about promoting fashion accessories made with local materials. These included wood, raffia and his personal favourite, calabash. His runway designs always included stunning accessories. The use of prominent accessories has now become an integral element of African fashion shows.
Production: Ansah was instrumental in the introduction of the Friday African wear policy in Ghana. This was aimed at promoting the wearing of local bespoke garments in workplaces on Fridays. Ansah used his friendship with then minister for trade and industry, Alan Kyeremanten, to push his idea to democratise and regularise the use of wax print. Ansah also influenced fashion production by employing international marketing strategies like fashion shows and exhibitions. He thus opened Ghanaian fashion to international audiences by using globally accepted techniques.
Human capital: More importantly, Ansah’s vision to grow a lasting and successful industry propelled him to mentor many of Ghana’s finest contemporary designers. He partnered with international agencies to launch mentorship programmes for young designers.
One such programme was the Web Young Designers Hub, financed by the French Embassy and coordinated by Ansah and Franca Sozzani, former editor of Vogue Italia. Another project spearheaded by Ansah was the Ethical Fashion Initiative, a partnership between the United Nations and the Presidential Special Initiative programme. These programmes and the exposure that came with them positioned contemporary designers to engage in “brain circulation.”
By participating in projects, young designers had the opportunity to travel to other countries and learn about aspects of fashion such as fabric production and event organisation. Such travel was geared towards acquiring knowledge that would have an impact on Ghana’s fashion industry.
These engagements helped young fashion designers build networks with designers across the globe.
Ansah’s impact
The Ghanaian fashion industry is making its mark globally. Steve French and other young designers are recognised for their creative works and talents. Garments made by Ghanaian designers like Duaba Serwaa and Christie Brown are worn by stars such as Lupita Nyongo and Beyonce respectively. Young Ghanaians, too, proudly wear African clothes for all occasions.

"Crime is among the major challenges confronting Nigeria as a nation. The pervasiveness of crime has repeatedly called into question the effectiveness and efficiency of the Nigeria Police Force. This is despite their exclusive reliance on modern policing strategies and techniques.
Traditionally, crime-related matters have been handled through what’s known as “spiritual security”. This is a knowledge system that involves the use of amulets, charms, rituals and talismans for protection, power and clairvoyance.
As sociologists specialising in criminology, we were interested in what the Nigerian police personnel had to say about these mechanisms of protection.
We conducted a study of their perceptions and attitudes. Many told us that they believed criminals used spiritual security for power and protection. Some officers confirmed that they themselves used charms and the like to help in their jobs.
Nigerians use spiritual security mechanisms in other areas of social life such as healthcare delivery, conflict resolution and household crime control. But they’ve been overlooked in formal policing.
We conclude that this indigenous approach to crime fighting could prove useful to the police, particularly in intelligence gathering, crime investigation and crime control. Traditional belief systems could complement the country’s colonially based law enforcement and social control systems and improve their efficiency.
Traditional belief systems
Spiritual security is a traditional knowledge system that dates from precolonial times. It was a way that Nigerian people dealt with social issues. Not only for security, but also to settle disputes and for social control, conflict resolution, justice administration, peace engineering and social harmony.
The knowledge system of most African societies is generally predicated on a belief system that’s divided into the physical (visible and seen) and the spiritual (mysterious and unobservable). History tells us that African people gave high credence to this system of knowledge.
Although mystical, preternatural and esoteric powers are virtually inexplicable, many Nigerians believe that they know when they are being manipulated by those who have access to such powers.
The study
Our research was carried out among police officials serving at the Oyo State Police Command. We interviewed 35 police officers belonging to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department and the Special Anti-Robbery Squad.
We wanted to know to what extent the police were aware of criminals using spiritual security mechanisms. And we asked for their views on the police using them too. Should they be integrated into police operations?
Most police officers acknowledged that the system of spiritual security mechanisms was part of a cultural heritage which many Africans employed. They explained that people did so to protect themselves from their enemies’ spiritual attacks and to neutralise the impact of deadly weapons such as guns, machetes and knives.
Participants said that their professional experiences in the field showed that criminals routinely used spiritual security mechanisms. They did so to strengthen and protect themselves when perpetrating crime such as armed robbery, kidnapping, rape and homicide.
There was no clear consensus about whether the mechanisms were effective or not. But many officers said they believed that the criminals’ use of spiritual security was capable of compromising police operations. One police officer said:
Criminals, especially armed robbers, usually rely on it. Some time around 2003 … we arrested four armed robbers and handcuffed them. Can you believe that two of them who were handcuffed together disappeared? … What happened that day was like a miracle. It was only after making consultation from the people who are knowledgeable that we were told that one of them deployed egbe (a spiritual device for disappearance).
Our research also established that some police officers were secretly consulting custodians of the traditional knowledge system to enhance their performance and safety on the job.
Our respondents, however, expressed differing opinions about whether spiritual security mechanisms should be integrated into modern police work. Those who supported the idea believed it could improve crime fighting and help keep officers safe.
Others dismissed the idea. They stressed the value of modern policing strategies and technology. Some said their religion (both Christian and Muslim) expressly forbade them from associating with traditional charms. Some felt it went against police culture and codes.
Physical security and spiritual security
The work experiences of police officers, however, generally demonstrated the importance of a knowledge system that recognises a connection between physical security and spiritual security.
Modern policing strategies are not adequately dealing with Nigeria’s crime and insecurity crisis. Notorious criminals are combining the use of sophisticated weapons with spiritual charms.
We recommend that Nigeria’s police force should explore any potential advantages that the system of spiritual security mechanisms might offer. If well applied, this hybridisation could boost intelligence gathering capacity and crime control efforts.",Charms and rituals are used by criminals in Nigeria – should police deploy spiritual security too?,arts + culture
"If Miriam Makeba is hailed as the South African vocalist of her generation who brilliantly embraced (and actually shaped) global music sounds, and Sathima Bea Benjamin as the experimenter who entranced the modern jazz scene in Europe and the US, then Ncediwe Sylvia Mdunyelwa joins that pantheon of late, great South African singers as the consummate vocal classicist. Known affectionately in her home city of Cape Town as “Mama Kaap”, Mdunyelwa passed away on 25 August at the age of 74.
As a researcher who documents historical and current South African jazz and popular music, I believe Mdunyelwa merits recognition not only for the regard she won from fellow players, but also for her activism as a community music educator and advocate for South African jazz.
At the core of her music was a fierce insistence on respect for the tradition – of the great American jazz singers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan as well as the traditional music of her isiXhosa-speaking community – and for the song.
Who was Sylvia Mdunyelwa?
Born in the Cape Town township of Langa, Mdunyelwa grew up in those traditions during the 1950s and 1960s, as white minority rule and apartheid were clamping down on black political activity.
Her uncle, Aspro Sipoyo, led the close-harmony vocal group The Semitones and her sister was a jazz singer. Her home became a meeting place for musicians, including bassist Victor Ntoni. Family gatherings sounded loud with religious songs; Fitzgerald, Vaughan and another US jazz vocalist, Carmen McRae, were all regulars on the record player. Singing along, the young Nce became a singer even before she had articulated the ambition to be one.
Her first employment in the late 1960s was at Cape Town’s Space Theatre as a receptionist. The Space provided a stage for independent and often politically challenging drama, for poets and for music. There she grew her experience as a vocalist and developed a formidable acting career.
Sunday afternoon jazz sessions at the theatre brought Mdunyelwa into contact with pianist Merton Barrow (credited by many Cape Town jazz players as unstinting with advice and guidance) and drummer Maurice Gawronsky. By her early 20s she was the vocalist with the regular band there, the Victor Ntoni Sextet, as well as guesting with other Cape Town jazz stars including the Ngcukana Brothers, Winston “Mankunku” Ngozi and many more.
But she was also drawn into some of the theatre productions The Space hosted. This experience led to her talent being noticed and to many later acting appearances, including parts in the US movie Freedom Road, the South African feature film Born to Win and numerous TV series.
Her passion to pass on all this skill and knowledge to younger generations led her into community arts education. And that, in turn, led to a 1990 Canada trip as the head of a youth group, and eventually to a bursary to study at UCLA. Tours followed, including to the Berlin Jazz Festival and to Colombia in Latin America (where she was awarded for her community work in Cape Town).
Albums
Mdunyelwa released two albums, the 1998 African Diva, recorded live at the National Arts Festival in Makhanda (then Grahamstown), and the 2000 studio recording Ingoma, on the international Blue Note jazz label.
African Diva is still available on the music streaming service Spotify, but, as she told South African jazz writer Warren Ludski a couple of years back, “I was asked if I got royalties from Spotify. I got nothing from Spotify. I didn’t even know about Spotify.”
Ingoma doesn’t seem to be available anywhere. A reissue is long overdue – ideally through a label that will make sure Mdunyelwa’s estate and legacy foundation actually do see some benefit.
In later years, the singer continued to perform in and around Cape Town. She also worked as a jazz broadcaster at Cape Town community radio station P4 and served on the board of the jazz and classical music specialist station Fine Music Radio.
But increasingly her passion was for community education and activism. She served on her local street committee in Langa, and composed the impassioned anthem Where are the Children Now? to draw attention to the situation of Cape Town’s young people, caught in the crossfire of poverty, family insecurity and crime.
Legacy
Mdunyelwa was a classicist of South African jazz song. Melody came first; lyrics were delivered with crystal clarity and emotional force; swing centred her versions of American classics (listen, for example to her version of Easy Street in Berlin). But there was always a compelling subtext of respect for Xhosa culture, the isiXhosa language and that community’s musicality.
She created new isiXhosa lyrics for the US jazz standard Stormy Weather, which became a favourite with her audiences. It all comes together beautifully on her rendition of the South African jazz standard Lakutshon’iLanga, which, for many people, remains the best ever. She left a tangible legacy in the skills of younger musicians she inspired and mentored.
Mdunyelwa harboured no illusions about the kind of support musicians could expect in South Africa. She told Ludski:
Forget about government. They will promise you something and you’ll be dead before you get anything. When you die as a legend or diva or icon, they will come and talk at your graveside. I don’t want that.
Nevertheless, I hope she receives multiple official tributes, accompanied by concrete support to ensure her legacy as a guardian of and activist-educator about the South African jazz tradition, however belated it all may now be.

"Cape Town in South Africa often tops international travel polls and was recently voted the best city in the world to travel to by readers of a UK newspaper. But the reality for many residents is a stark contrast.
On 3 August 2023 the South African National Taxi Council announced strike action in the city as well the rest of the Western Cape province. Minibuses were recalled from service until 9 August in response to a new traffic by-law and other ongoing issues.
Read more: Fixing South Africa's minibus taxi industry is proving hard: tracing its history shows why
Privately owned minibus taxis provide an important and affordable mode of transport for poor people living in South Africa’s townships, residential areas created for people racialised as black and so-called “coloured” during apartheid.
During the strike many people who were unable to get other transport out of the city centre faced long walks home on highways and roadways in the dark.
Having researched spatial inequality in different contexts around the world including Cape Town, it is clear that the taxi strike has highlighted South Africa’s enduring spatial inequality and social divides, which have not been adequately addressed following the end of apartheid.
Legacy of apartheid
It’s been almost 30 years since South Africa held its first democratic elections. Yet the legacy of apartheid remains a spatial, economic and social reality.
Arriving in Cape Town, many travellers will take the N2 highway to the city centre. The route goes through the Cape Flats. As the outline of Table Mountain grows clearer, so too does the stark inequality. The Cape Flats is predominantly home to people racialised as black and coloured. In this area there is a high density of informal freestanding and backyard shacks with poor access to water and sanitation services and high rates of violence and crime.
Apartheid was a system of racialisation and segregation by the white minority government.
People racialised as black, coloured, and Indian were displaced from the centre of Cape Town to the Cape Flats and other areas and were also forced to carry passes. The passes dictated where they were allowed to be.
If stopped without a pass or outside of authorised spaces, people faced arrest and jail. These laws were also used to manage a supply of cheap labour.
Violence of space
The effects of the ongoing inequality can be understood as a form of peace without justice. I frame the ongoing inequality as the violence of space. Physical distance, poor infrastructure, and economic inequality cement divisions in the city and limit movement. At the same time people living in townships are also more likely to experience physical violence.
This can be understood as spatial injustice, or the inequitable sharing of “socially valued resources and the opportunities to use them”. The way in which this dynamic unfolds today can be understood as racial capitalism.
Read more: We mapped green spaces in South Africa and found a legacy of apartheid
Racial capitalism is the intersection of inequality (as a product of capitalism) and racism (as a system which sustains this inequality). This can be seen geographically through underfunding communities, gentrification and displacement. This is not exclusive to South Africa and can be identified in many cities globally. But the historical context of South Africa shapes the spatial inequality.
The scope of this has been shown by the taxi strike. Still today, people living in townships often travel longer distances to work or school. This often means travelling in the dark and at greater risk of crime, a situation made worse by ongoing national electricity blackouts.
Taxi strike impact
Over the days of the strike five people died during sporadic violence. Buses and cars were stoned or torched and shops were looted. Several healthcare centres were closed. Essential items and food such as bread and milk were in short supply and were subject to price hikes in townships. The areas with more occurrences of violence were all far from the city centre and affluent suburbs. Many people living in townships could not travel to work or school. In other areas, such as the city centre, some food supply was interrupted, and some museums and restaurants closed early or did not open.
As the strike and instability continued, dozens of women in the Philippi township marched for an end to the looting and violence. The taxi strike was called off on 11 August after an agreement was reached between the taxi council and the Western Cape government, with tensions continuing.
The ‘best’ city for who?
The categories for deciding “best” city are typically based on food, nature and cultural spaces. In Cape Town, these spaces and experiences are often supported by the labour of people who commute long distances from areas with poor access to basic resources.

"Directors of historical feature films face a difficult task. How can they make the characters familiar to an audience without reducing them to caricature? How can they make sure that knowledge of the outcome – battles won or lost, empires built then ruined – doesn’t make the story seem like it’s writing itself?
Director Ridley Scott is not a historian and presumably wants to entertain rather than to enlighten. But the problem of historical truth is an interesting one.
The trailer for Napoleon.
It is not easy to know the “real” Napoleon. There’s a recognisable version of him – the confident general beloved of his troops, the instinctive military tactician who could run on empty for days at a time, his stern and somewhat petulant gaze. But much of this is the product of layers of historical storytelling, accrued by the labour of generations of artists, journalists and memoirists – and of course, Napoleon himself.
Abel Gance’s spectacular silent film Napoleon (1927), for example, charted the life and career of Napoleon up to his departure as a military general for the Italian campaign in 1796. In one scene, a heavy winter snowfall interrupts classes at Napoleon’s military college. The boys run outside to play and inevitably start throwing snowballs at each other. The scene depicts a very young Napoleon emerging as a natural commander, directing the combat as though on the field of battle.
Yet the veracity of this moment rests primarily on a single account – the memoir of one of Napoleon’s childhood friends, Louis de Bourrienne, who attended the same school. The author was later an employee of Napoleon, who sacked him for embezzlement in 1802.
Many years later, in 1829, de Bourrienne penned a memoir in the hope of cashing in on the popular appetite for authentic tales of the great general. What we think we know about the “real” Napoleon is often filtered through self-interested and partial accounts like this one.
Here are the facts and legends behind some of the major scenes from Ridley Scott’s new Napoleon biopic.
Did Napoleon crown himself?
Napoleon went to great lengths to craft his image as a benign ruler and man of the people, often enlisting the talents of artists to do so.
Most notoriously, Jacques-Louis David was commissioned to produce a series of grand paintings depicting Napoleon’s coronation in Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris in December 1804. In the most famous, we see Napoleon place a crown on the head of the new Empress Josephine while a reluctant Pope Pius VII looks on.

In an astonishing act of hubris, Napoleon had indeed already placed a crown on his own head, though the oil painting shows him only in laurel leaves to signify his martial triumphs. What Scott’s film depicts is the magnificence of the oil paintings, which showed Napoleon and his empress in the most flattering light, rather than the coronation ceremony itself.
His relationship with Josephine
There is no doubt that Napoleon felt a deep passion for Marie Joséphe Rose de la Pagerie – known to him as Joséphine – whom he married in 1796 as his military career was in the ascendant. Yet her depiction in Ridley Scott’s film as a young seductress probably speaks more to sexist cliche than to Joséphine’s undoubted self-assuredness.

She was six years older than Napoleon, a widow and mother of two young children when they met, and the young general’s romantic feelings were seemingly stronger than hers. While on campaign he wrote to her virtually every day, his pen sometimes piercing the parchment, such was the force of his emotions. Yet some of these letters to her remained unopened.
Their relationship was as tumultuous as it was passionate, and both spouses had several affairs. Yet when Napoleon instigated divorce in 1809 for want of an heir, it was surprisingly amicable. The Empress retained her imperial title until her death in 1814 and was permitted to continue living in the imperial Château de Malmaison.
Was Napoleon present at the execution of Marie Antoinette?
The autumn of 1793 was especially busy for Napoleon given his increasingly important role in the Siege of Toulon. Federalist rebels had handed over the French fleet to the British admiral Samuel Hood, and the young artillery officer commanded the operation that eventually seized it back.
Therefore it is highly unlikely that he ventured to Paris in October to be among the crowd that witnessed the execution of Queen Marie-Antoinette.
Another trailer for Napoleon shows the lead up to Marie Antionette’s execution.
In a letter to his older brother Joseph, however, Napoleon did claim to witness the storming of the Tuileries Palace by an angry crowd of republican protesters in June 1792. It revolted him.
Did Napoleon really fire at the pyramids?
Napoleon began his Egyptian campaign in 1798. The cultural legacy of the campaign can be seen in the well-stocked Egyptology section of the Louvre. But it was also the scene of atrocities.
At one point, several thousand Ottoman soldiers were shot or driven into the sea on Napoleon’s orders, rather than taken prisoner. You don’t need to invent ice traps or Napoleon ordering his men to fire at the pyramids, as Ridley Scott’s biopic does, to convey his callous disregard for life.

It was the rumour that he had ordered his own plague-stricken troops to be poisoned in the town of Jaffa that finally tarnished Napoleon’s reputation in the early 19th century. It stuck, no matter how brilliant the sanitising riposte of the artist Antoine-Jean Gros, whom Napoleon commissioned in 1804 to paint a different story.
Ridley Scott’s film does not represent the past so much as carry versions of the tales and images depicting Napoleon that have spun him into existence since his own lifetime – many of which were crafted by his own hand.

"I don’t know about you, but my TikTok is full of influencers telling me I should be a Stoic. You might know the term “stoic” as a person who goes through hardship while maintaining a steely and calm disposition, and never complains. However, a stoic is also someone who prescribes to the philosophical school of Stoicism.
Stoicism became popular in ancient Rome. Stoic TikTok exclusively draws on Roman Stoicism, mainly Epictetus (a formerly enslaved person), Seneca (a fabulously wealthy and self-aggrandizing advisor to the emperor Nero), and Marcus Aurelius (who was himself a Roman emperor).
But the school goes back much further to ancient Athens, where Stoicism was founded around 300BCE by Zeno of Citium. After Zeno, Stoicism flourished in Athens, especially under Chrysippus, known as the second founder of Stoicism.
On TikTok, you’ll see people saying that Stoicism is a great way to lead a happy and productive life. I’m a professional philosopher who specialises in ancient Greek philosophy – and it’s great, if somewhat surprising, to see how popular Stoicism has become over the last ten years. But as a philosopher, I’m not a Stoic – and Stoic TikTok gets quite a lot wrong about this way of thinking.
This article is part of Quarter Life, a series about issues affecting those of us in our twenties and thirties. From the challenges of beginning a career and taking care of our mental health, to the excitement of starting a family, adopting a pet or just making friends as an adult. The articles in this series explore the questions and bring answers as we navigate this turbulent period of life.

Despite what you see on TikTok, Stoicism was a dry, technical, ivory tower philosophy. Its ideas around happiness and productivity diverge quite a bit from what modern people consider these to be. Traditionally, it was divided into three branches: ethics, physics, and logic – much of which TikTok’s Stoic preachers don’t get quite right.
Logic
Distinctively, the Stoics emphasised logic, comparing it to the shell of an egg or the bones and sinews of a body, because logic protects (like a shell), supports (like bones) and connects (like sinews) our beliefs and knowledge. In fact, the Stoics developed a systematic logical theory which, through various historical twists and turns, inspired 20th-century logic and hence theoretical computer science.
The Stoics took logic seriously because it was needed for knowledge. For the Stoics, to know something – including how to live well – was to understand it so totally that you could defend your view against any degree of argumentative scrutiny, against any opponent. In other words, they used logic to win a sort of philosophical Hunger Games.
But Stoic TikTok isn’t really interested in a deep, rich and logically defensible knowledge of the world and our place in it. In so far as Stoic TikTok is interested in knowledge, it implies that you can get knowledge by simply reading quotations of famous Stoics or practising certain mental exercises, such as meditating on death.
Physics
Stoic TikTok also ignores Stoic physics – the principles that Stoics used to explain the natural processes in the universe. For the Stoics, everything that exists, including your soul and God, is a body. God, in fact, is “mixed with matter, pervading all of it and so shaping it, structuring it and making it into the world”, as the critic Alexander of Aphrodisias told us in the early third century.
The Stoics argued that, since God is rational and active, this makes everything that exists in the world rational and organised for the best. You are part of this rational universe so, if bad things happen to you, it would be irrational to complain – as if your foot complained about getting muddy.
This idea of a rational universe is popular with Stoic TikTok, and can be seen in posts telling followers to “love their fate”. They suggest that true happiness comes from accepting anything that happens.
But does loving your fate in a truly Stoic sense achieve the sort of productivity and happiness most people want? I think not.
Ethics
Which brings us to Stoic ethics. While Stoic TikTok promises productivity and happiness, it’s unlikely you’ll achieve the levels of productivity and happiness you actually desire if you go by what Stoics believed these to be.
Happiness, for a Stoic, was a matter of having virtues and lacking vices. Everything else – including health, wealth and status – were “indifferents”, because they made no difference to your virtue, and so to your happiness.
So, even if the self-helpy advice of Stoic TikTok could make you more productive, being more productive won’t make you be happier, according to Stoic philosophy. At best, you’ll acquire health, wealth or status, but those things are indifferent to your happiness.
There is, of course, something hypocritical about Seneca arguing that wealth is indifferent while being one of the richest men in Rome; or Marcus Aurelius saying that power is indifferent while being emperor.
It is rational to prefer to be healthy rather than ill, rich rather than poor, powerful rather than oppressed. In fact, there was nuanced ancient debate in which the Stoics tried to find a middle way between a view where health, money and power are simply good, and a view where they are totally irrelevant to living a good life.
Chrysippus tried to steer this course by saying that while health, wealth and power are indifferent, how you use them is not. If I use power intemperately or wealth to indulge my most disgusting appetites, I will not be virtuous or happy. Personally, I don’t think the Stoic philosophy will ultimately solve this problem of whether health, wealth and power are totally indifferent to happiness, but it is an open question.
I’ve not touched here on the more sinister aspects of Stoicism on the internet, discussed in Donna Zuckerberg’s Not All Dead White Men. Rather, I’ve tried to point out what Stoic TikTok misses, because I hope people dive deeper into Stoic philosophy. A great place to start is Tad Brennan’s The Stoic Life.
Stoicism is a rich, fascinating and sophisticated philosophical tradition. But, if you’re looking for happiness and productivity in more modern terms, the Stoics might not have the answer.

"Throughout the 1960s, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles were engaged in a friendly rivalry. Despite being amicable in person, they were in competition for record sales, cultural influence and aesthetic credibility.
Despite their enormous popularity, however, not even the most ardent fans of either band would have expected that such a competition would still be going on more than 50 years later. And yet, the Stones recently reached number one on the UK album charts with their album Hackney Diamonds, and the Beatles have done the same on the singles charts.
But how much of this recent success is down to the quality of the songs themselves, and how much is to do with nostalgia?
Both bands have remained commercially and culturally significant since the 1960s, and both have had recent commercial successes prior to their new releases. The Beatles’ 50th anniversary re-release of Abbey Road topped the UK charts in 2019, and the Stones’s No Filter Tour – which ran between 2017 and 2019 – was one of the highest grossing tours of all time.
Even more recently, Peter Jackson’s Get Back documentary showed that the Beatles still have immense cultural capital, 51 years after splitting up. As for both bands’ latest releases, however, their success may be more down to us attaching pre-existing positive memories to their music.
Reminiscence bump
Music psychologist Patrik Juslin has observed that episodic memories linked to music often arouse emotions, such as nostalgia. Listening to any new music from the Stones or the Beatles will naturally remind fans of our early experiences in listening to them. If those memories were good, we may experience a “reminiscence bump” – a psychological term to describe when music or other triggers take us back to exciting times in our lives, when we experienced things for the first time.
When The One Show broadcast an exclusive short film detailing the making of Now and Then the day before its official release, it left the BBC show’s hosts visibly emotional. Later, music broadcaster Lauren Laverne, who introduced the film, admitted: “I cried like a baby! And I never cry.”
The One Show’s hosts are emotional after hearing the new Beatles track.
The reason for such emotion? The song involved all four Beatles performing on the same track, something most fans never thought they’d experience again. Paul McCartney felt the same way, commenting: “It’s quite emotional. And we all play on it, it’s a genuine Beatles recording.”
The opportunity to hear the Beatles together again, one last time, is an irresistible prospect regardless of whether the song is any good, worthy of the Beatles name, or can be considered an official Beatles release at all.
And when the music video (directed by Jackson) was released, with the aid of some – slightly heavy-handed – trickery, we were able to see the Fab Four united again. It was hard not to get swept up in the poignancy of it all.
Rolling nostalgia
As far back as 1989, the Rolling Stones were described in an LA Times headline as “Just Rolling on Nostalgia”. Many of the previews of Hackney Diamonds spoke about how the album reflected “the band in its pomp” and how it included “classic Stones signposts”.
Much was also made of the fact that the band’s late drummer, Charlie Watts, played on two of the tracks, and that he was joined by their former bassist, Bill Wyman, on the song Live By The Sword. This reunited the version of The Rolling Stones from the mid-70s to the early 90s. For this reason, the Evening Standard’s Martin Robinson described the track as carrying “considerable emotional weight”.
On his YouTube channel, Justin Hawkins, frontman of The Darkness, shared a clip of him listening to the new Stones song Angry. After hearing Mick Jagger’s count-in, Hawkins pauses the track and says: “Brilliant! It’s exactly what you want to hear.” Later, he praises the Keith Richards solo as being “classically Keith”.

And that’s just it. They may not be doing anything different to what they did 50 years ago, but as long as the music evokes memories that speak to the heart, it’s enough for most fans.
Whether this is the last new music we’ll hear from these two titans of popular music remains to be seen. But the nostalgia towards them is only going to increase as time goes on, meaning that if they do release any more tracks, they are likely to be even more popular.

"There have been many TV shows and films inspired by the dual fear and excitement surrounding advances in artificial intelligence (AI). But not many exhibit such masterful craft and profound humanity as the new Netflix anime miniseries, Pluto.
Pluto is adapted from a manga series of the same title (2003-2009), created by Naoki Urasawa and Takashi Nagasaki. The manga version – considered a comic masterpiece for its beautiful art and sophisticated storyline – incorporated fundamental elements from Osamu Tezuka’s celebrated manga series Astro Boy (1952-1968), including the beloved android adolescent who was the titular character.
The trailer for Pluto.
Pluto is set in a futuristic world in which humans and robots coexist, albeit within a hierarchy in favour of humans. Robots excel in various jobs ranging from nannies and butlers to architects and detectives, but they are treated as second-class citizens.
Although robots gradually gain their own rights codified into law, they are still exploited by humans, who downplay their worth and emotional intelligence. As much as humans depend on AI, they also feel threatened by it.
An AI murder mystery
Pluto, which has both Japanese and English audio versions, follows German robot detective Gesicht (Shinshū Fuji/Jason Vande Brake) as he traces the mysterious killings of robots and humans. The world’s seven most advanced robots (including Gesicht himself) and robot-friendly humans (including his creator) are the targets of this assassination scheme.
What’s most perplexing is that the murders appear untraceable. This suggests that the killer might be a very advanced robot, challenging the belief that robots can’t ever kill humans due to their programmed constraints.
Gesicht is voiced by Jason Vande Brake in the English dub. Netflix
This enigmatic case echoes the cautionary message found in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein – beware of human beings’ ambitious dreams and creations. While the story begins as a murder mystery, it evolves into a thoughtful drama about the conflicted relationships between humans and androids.
While Pluto draws on many familiar sci-fi concepts, it distinguishes itself through its meticulous character development and the depth of its micro-stories. Every character is complex, and the audience is able to get to know them and become invested in their fates. The anime’s unhurried pace also allows viewers ample time to contemplate its philosophical questions about consciousness evolution and the powerful impacts of emotions.
Despite all its brilliance, however, the series is not without flaws. It has a dated representation of gender roles, with no female characters – whether human or robot – playing an important part. None of them break free from the stereotypical role of nurturing, stay-behind support for their exceptionally capable and powerful male partners.
Animation of the year
Pluto maintains a melancholic tone throughout – but despite this overarching dark ambience, it is at times romantic and moving. It exalts love, friendship and compassion without falling into sentimentality, evoking an emotional resonance reminiscent of Blade Runner (1982).
The series emphasises that life, or the process of living, imparts character and humanity, transcending biological organs and blood. Androids may initially be devoid of complex emotions, but they develop sentience through everyday experiences and interactions with fellow robots and humans.

Robots can even learn to appreciate music, as manifested by the charismatic North No.2 (Koichi Yamadera/Patrick Seitz), who was designed for intense combat but grows weary of warfare. The narrative underscores the simultaneous beauty and danger of emotions – particularly the destructive force of wrath.
With great technological advancements and comfort, this futuristic world is still torn by war. It poses the question: “Will war ever end?” – reminding us of the conflicts and tragedies happening in the real world. The anime suggests that an end to war is unlikely as long as hatred persists.
For me, with its beautiful art and riveting narrative, Pluto stands out as one of the best Netflix productions of all time. It’s certainly the best animated work of the year.

"As I write this, my wife is desperately trying to avoid spoilers for the latest episode of Strictly Come Dancing. Having missed the original broadcast, she has been frantically logging out of all forms of social media, lest a stray Facebook status or retweet give the game away. Add to this the possibility of a friend innocently revealing what happens, and it’s clear just how difficult it is to live spoiler-free.
And it’s not just difficult for those watching television. For followers of sports, too, there is a longstanding problem of avoiding the final score before being able to watch the game.
Popular book series also face the problem of key twists being revealed too early. When J.K. Rowling’s novel Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released in 2005, a banner was hung over a bridge over the A442 in Shropshire revealing an important character’s death.
Council officials swiftly removed the banner – although possibly because it was likely to fall, rather than out of fear of ruining people’s enjoyment.
No hiding place
Spoilers, then, seem to be everywhere – and the general view is that they are bad. In its extreme form, “toxic” spoilers arise from both the pleasure some take in spoiling others’ surprise and the use of plot ruining as a form of vengeance.
This ire can be aimed at specific people or the series itself. The latter happened with the Star Wars prequel films, as some fans spoiled the endings for those who hadn’t seen it yet “immunisation against disappointment”.
Spoilers can be weaponised in this way because of some of our assumptions about them. Most fundamentally, that they ruin enjoyment. But is it that simple? In a series of psychological experiments published in 2011, researchers in California found that knowing the end of a story did not diminish readers’ enjoyment. In fact, readers preferred the stories where they had the ending revealed to them beforehand.
Some Star Wars fans believed that spoiling the new films offered fellow fans ‘immunisation against disappointment’. John Gomez/Shutterstock
The researchers theorised that we think of spoilers negatively because we are unable to compare spoiled and unspoiled experiences and therefore assume that the unspoiled is better. They argued that: “It is possible that spoilers enhance enjoyment by actually increasing tension. Knowing the ending of Oedipus Rex may heighten the pleasurable tension caused by the disparity in knowledge between the omniscient reader and the character marching to his doom.”
These experiments focused on classical literature, which often requires some kind of explanation in order to follow the plot at all. The spoilers in this research were therefore arguably able to complement the plot, at least for a contemporary readership unfamiliar with the complexities of ancient Greek tragedy.
Perhaps the experiments may have reached different conclusions if they had used, say, screenings of the Succession finale.
Travelling at the speed of spoilers
Also, because the research involved texts that were all written a long time ago, their experiments removed the issue of the timeline of when information does and does not count as a spoiler.
These boundaries are debatable. In 2008, Vulture, an entertainment news website, published a satirical “statute of limitations” on spoiler reveals. They ranged from “as soon as the episode finished” for reality TV to 100 years after its debut performance for operas.
The speed of the spoiler is significant because it is inherently linked to the digital platforms that carry them to both willing and unwilling readers. In other words, finding out things too soon raises more fundamental questions about how we engage with the rapid availability of information across digital media today.
Consider the controversy when a Wikipedia article on Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap was created. According to Wikipedia guidelines, a summary of the plot was required. But the question was whether the twist of who the murderer is should be revealed in this summary, given that theatre audiences are historically sworn to secrecy at the end of each show.
It was agreed, in the end, that users of Wikipedia should expect this information to be revealed. We do not need to be Poirot to deduce from this that our expectation of information being easily and readily available creates the conditions for a constant threat of spoilers.
Audiences of The Mousetrap are famously sworn to secrecy over its ending. RichartPhotos/Shutterstock
This points to the real problem with spoilers. Whether they ruin plot twists or not depends on the idea that presenting reductive summaries – pure information – somehow replaces or equates to an understanding of the film, show, or story.
In his book Spoiler Alert, literary theorist Aaron Jaffe argues that the threat of the spoiler hinges on the idea that everything can be translated into information and that information can be found everywhere. But this is – he clarifies with a spoiler alert – a myth. In truth, information is rarely fully accessible or complete, due to the different ways it is stored and connected.
It may seem obvious to say that should I accidentally discover the score of a football game before I get to watch it, it would spoil my entertainment. But the score would not tell me if my team deserved to lose, if they were robbed by a referee’s decision, if my favourite player had improved, and so on. In short, the spoiler does not allow me to interpret the meaning of the game.
So while spoilers seem to require us to log out of X or avoid low bridges on the A442, there is still a part of our enjoyment that blunt information cannot remove.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the media landscape, both for news organisations and consumers. Applications such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing AI are creating new possibilities to assist in writing and researching the news, but these also raise ethical concerns.
One of the most pressing questions for news organisations is whether consumers should be told when they are reading a story created, or aided by, use of AI. Some, such as the technology magazine Wired and the BBC are already doing this, but other media outlets are not.
There are several arguments for and against disclosing this kind of information.
First, it would help to ensure transparency and accountability. Consumers should know how the news they are consuming is being produced, and they should be able to make informed choices about whether or not to trust it.
Second, disclosure could help mitigate the risks of bias. AI systems are trained using data, and that data can reflect the biases of the people who created it. As a result, AI-generated content can sometimes be biased. By requiring disclosure, consumers would be able to be aware of this potential bias and take it into account when evaluating the information.
Third, disclosure could help to protect consumers from misinformation . AI systems can be used to generate fake news, making it difficult for consumers to distinguish between real and fake news. By requiring disclosure, consumers would be able to be more sceptical of AI-generated content and be more likely to verify it before sharing it.
Against disclosure
One concern is that it could stifle innovation. If news organisations are required to disclose every time they use AI, they may be less likely to experiment with the technology.
Another is that disclosure could be confusing for consumers. Not everyone understands how AI works. Some people may be suspicious of AI-generated content. Requiring disclosure could make it more difficult for consumers to get the information they need.
The BBC has issued a statement setting out how it will use AI in its programmes. P Amedzro /Alamy
How things could play out
Here are a couple of examples to illustrate these concerns:
Imagine a news organisation is using AI to perform real-time fact-checking and verification of statements made by public figures during live events, such as political debates or press conferences. An AI system could rapidly identify inaccuracies and provide viewers with accurate information in real-time.
However, if the news organisation were required to disclose the use of AI each time, it might lead to a reluctance to deploy such a tool. The fear of public perception and potential backlash could deter news outlets from leveraging AI to enhance the accuracy of their reporting, ultimately depriving the audience of a valuable service.
Another scenario involves AI-driven personalised news curation. Many news platforms use AI algorithms to tailor news content to individual readers’ preferences, ensuring they receive information that aligns with their interests.
If news organisations were compelled to disclose the use of AI in this context, readers might become wary of perceived manipulation. This apprehension could deter news outlets from investing in AI-driven personalisation, limiting their ability to engage and retain audiences in an increasingly competitive media landscape.
Read more: Deepfakes in warfare: new concerns emerge from their use around the Russian invasion of Ukraine
To mitigate these risks, publications such as the New York Times are offering “enhanced bylines” that include more details about the journalists behind the stories and details about how the story was produced.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to require disclosure is a complex one.
However, it is essential to have a public conversation about this issue so that we can develop policies that protect consumers and promote responsible journalism, and retain and improve trust in journalism, which is falling in some countries.
In addition to disclosure, there are other things that news organisations can do to ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly. They should develop clear guidelines for the use of AI. These guidelines should address issues such as bias, transparency and accountability. They should invest in training and education for their staff. Journalists need to understand how AI works and how to use it responsibly.
Finally, news organisations should work with highly informed groups such as Harvard’s Neiman Lab, those working on policy, technology companies and academics, to develop ethical standards for using AI and tackle emerging issues critical to the future of public-interest news.
The use of AI tools in news is a significant development . It is vital to have a thoughtful and informed conversation about this technology’s potential benefits and risks. By working together, we can ensure that AI is used in a way that serves the public interest and upholds the values of responsible journalism.",Should the media tell you when they use AI to report the news?

"Dechen, 40, grew up in Thimphu, the capital city of Bhutan. Her native language was Mangdip, also known as Nyenkha, as her parents are originally from central Bhutan. She went to schools in the city, where the curriculum was predominantly taught in Dzongkha, the national language, and English.
In Dechen’s house, everyone spoke Dzongkha. She only spoke her mother tongue when she had guests from her village, who could not understand Dzongkha and during her occasional visits to her village nestled in the mountains. Her mother tongue knowledge was limited.
However, things have now changed.
With 90% of Bhutanese people using social media and social media penetrating all remotes areas in Bhutan, Dechen’s relatives in remote villages are connected on WeChat.
She is in three WeChat groups where people usually communicate through voice messages in their native language. Most WeChat users in rural parts of the country communicate in their oral native language.
“I learn many words. I learnt how to say a lot of things in my own language,” the mother of two now living in Western Australia told me.
Dechen’s story is not isolated. Social media is giving a new lifeline to Bhutan’s native languages, which do not have written script and lack proper documentation. By communicating through voice messages, social media is giving Bhutanese people in both urban and rural areas a new opportunity to use their local language.

Losing Bhutan’s languages
Bhutan is a tiny Himalayan nation with a population of under 800,000 people. Internet and television was introduced only in 1999 and mobile phones in 2004.
The country has more than 20 local languages, but only Dzongkha has written text and is promoted as the national language.
The country struggles to promote the national language and its usage against English. Today most urban residents, especially the elites, speak English as their primary language.
WeChat users can send each other voice messages in their local language. Shutterstock
Many languages – especially minority languages – are vanishing or becoming endangered as younger generations switch to Dzongkha and English.
The medium of instruction in schools is mostly in English; Dzongkha is taught only as grammar and literature. Students are shamed and often punished for using their local languages.
The preservation and promotion of local languages, therefore, depends on the speakers. A language faces extinction when its speakers die out or switch to another language.
Linguist Pema Wangdi has researched languages in Bhutan, and he told me many people are losing their native language.
“When we lose our language, we lose a piece of our national identity,” he told me.
Languages are an important part of cultural identities. Pema Gyamtsho/Unsplash
Wangdi has identified there are no longer any speakers of Olekha, an indigenous dialect of Rukha in Wangdu Phodrang.
“The loss of a single language is a loss of a piece of our national linguistic heritage and identity,” he said. “When a language is lost, cultural traditions which are tied to that language such as songs, myths and poetry will be lost forever.”
Other Bhutanese languages – including Tshophu language of Doyaps in Samtse, Monpa language of central Bhutan, and Gongdukha of Mongar – are endangered and at the brink of extinction.
Preservation of local languages
The future of the minority languages are at threat. The Constitution of Bhutan mandates the preservation and promotion of local languages, but there are no official efforts to preserve native languages.
But encouraging people to speak their native languages can have far reaching benefits in preserving and promoting Bhutan’s rich culture and tradition. Language embodies identity, ethnicity and cultural values: a thriving local language would help transfer this intangible wealth to the younger generation.
Social media could be an invaluable tool in this preservation.

Bhutan could save its languages from becoming extinct with promotion of social media usages and language education could be done on the social media platforms. With both young and old people glued to social media, encouraging more people to use local languages in social media could generate interest among the youth to learn their local languages.
It could also help in documenting the endangered local languages as the older generation can record their voices on WeChat.
Many elder citizens feel strongly about their language and emphasise teaching their mother tongue to the younger generation and their grandchildren. Social media – joining the younger generation on platforms where they feel at home – could be the way forward.

"Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland, is renowned for its remarkably well-preserved monuments. Many of these are Neolithic (10,000 BC to 2,200 BC) and consist of stone circles and chambered tombs, which are still highly visible in the landscape. Chambered tombs are monuments built of stone with a chamber area designed to hold the remains of the dead.
In many parts of Britain, chambered tombs have been robbed for stone, and while this was also the case on Orkney, most sites do not seem to have been as badly affected as in other parts of the country.
In 2020 one of my team encountered a series of letters preserved in National Museums Scotland’s library relating to a dispute over some Neolithic objects discovered in Orkney in the 19th century.
This led us to a newspaper account in the Orkney Herald in 1896, which reported that Orkney antiques specialist James Walls Cursiter had encountered a series of archaeological discoveries made by the son of the landowner at Holm, on the east side of Orkney’s mainland.
The team excavate the find. National Museums Scotland
The finds included a mace-head made from gneiss (a metamorphic rock with a distinct banding), a plain stone ball and eight skeletons. They were found within the ruins of a stone mound that had previously supplied stone to build a nearby farmhouse. The surviving stonework was interpreted by Cursiter as the remains of a “chambered burial mound”.
This discovery was rapidly forgotten. By coincidence, a recently discovered archaeological notebook belonging to Cursiter revealed further details of the finds. This included a sketch of the monument and, most importantly, an approximate location of the discovery.
All of this appeared to suggest that there may well be an unknown chambered tomb, mostly destroyed, but surviving to some extent nevertheless awaiting rediscovery.
Discovering the tomb
In 2022 a geophysical survey was carried out in the same location as described by Cursiter. Among other features, these surveys located a substantial archaeological anomaly on top of a prominent mound almost precisely in the location described as a position of the monument.
In 2023, we decided to open up a trench to see if anything survived. When we arrived at the site, it did not look promising. All that remained on the ground was a very slight grassy dome which had clearly been ploughed over the years. In a field of many grassy knolls, it was hard to see how this was anything exceptional. Yet, the location was quite prominent, with views out over the landscape in many directions, comparable to other passage tombs in the area. A passage tomb is a type of chambered tomb with a long thin passage leading to a central chamber with smaller cells off the main chamber.
As we peeled off the turf, we quickly came down onto heavily disturbed soil containing smashed Victorian ceramics and stone rubble. This came from a nearby farmhouse that had robbed stone from the tomb in order to build their barn. There was no rubbish collection then, so their waste went out on to the fields. But scattered among this recent material were small fragments of bone which looked much older.
As we dug further down, we started to encounter the lower walls of a stone structure, exactly as described by Cursiter. Much of the bone within the stone structure was highly fragmentary, which seemed to reinforce the idea that this monument had been mostly destroyed in the 19th century.
The team excavate the find. National Museums Scotland
However, in one of the side cells off the main passage – which was largely filled with small stone rubble that accumulated from the dismantling of an intact side cell which would once have had a high roof – we found a perfectly preserved and undisturbed Neolithic tomb deposit.
This consisted of a minimum of 14 burials of seven adults and seven children. The skeletons were placed in a variety of different positions. Two were crouched (knees to chest) and laid on their side, while another was tightly flexed with the knees pulled tight to the chest, and placed face down. Two were placed in the grave embracing one another, with the remains of two young children placed on their heads.
This level of preservation is remarkable. It is quite unusual to find tomb deposits intact and so well preserved.
In revealing and excavating these remains, we have found a lost passage tomb, but also revealed that these finds will not be preserved forever. The soil added into the monument during the Victorian destruction of the site has been eroding the bones ever since, so it is now a race against time to retrieve what survives.
The human remains will enable to us discover many different aspects of peoples’ lives in the Neolithic age, including what they ate and how they died. It also shows that in a landscape where many monuments are exceptionally well preserved, there are still new and exciting discoveries to be made.

"I felt I was missing something when I went on a Sunday night in late October to see Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour at my local independent cinema. I was: it was the audience.
I can’t remember the last time I sat alone in a cinema, but it was undoubtedly for fare far more obscure than this much-hyped event movie. But as I sat back in my seat and let the experience wash over me, it turned out to be an unexpectedly intimate encounter. Just me and Taylor.
The trailer for the Eras tour film.
It’s no surprise that the 33 year-old singer-songwriter, at the peak of her powers and cultural influence, should be the centre of attention in this 169-minute film.
The performances are combined from the first three of six shows staged in August at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Los Angeles. They are as seamlessly interwoven cinematically as they are orchestrated musically, in linked chapters featuring songs (and dance routines) from Swift’s ten studio albums to date.
Each section is announced on screen with the album title and defined visually by lavish costume changes and magical set transformations. This show is as much a piece of theatre as it is cinema. But where was the audience in all this?
Those closest to the stage, who flanked the catwalk pier, are submerged in an ocean of iPhone glow. The rest, stretching far away across and up to the stadium’s upper terrace, appear as small starlit circles.
There are occasional cutaways to devoted fans (mostly female, mostly dressed like Taylor Swift) singing along in word-perfect synchronicity. But the most intimate moment of communal theatre comes when a girl of five or six is offered up for a blessing. Swift bends and embraces the child, placing her black hat on her too small head. The crowd is overcome. This is a love-in on a global, stadium scale.
The history of the concert film
The concert film came of age in the 1970s. The format was all about capturing the essence of live performance and the skill and sinew of serious musicianship.
The booming music industry of the 1970s was irresistible to Hollywood’s wavering fortunes. Concert films were a shop window for record sales and often had direct tie-ins to live albums. The concept nature of these films (typically comprising multiple performances, overdubbing in post-production, multi-stereo or “quad” soundtracks and early videotape effects) didn’t dilute the liveness of their central performances.
Cream perform Sunshine Of Your Love in their Farewell Concert film.
The performances were generally shot with rudimentary camera set-ups by crews who came from television advertising and the music business rather than the film industry (not least because they were made by record labels rather than film studios). But this contributed to their authentic feel.
The concert film evolves
The concert film also took on another kind of life during the 1970s. It was characterised by the sort of retrospective musical resumé that Taylor Swift might recognise. Cream’s farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall on November 26 1968 had been filmed by Tony Palmer and a BBC crew and was later shown on television.
Then, Martin Scorsese directed The Last Waltz (1978), a feature-length documentary for cinemas marking The Band’s disbanding in 1976. The film broke the established mould by removing all signs of the on screen connection between audience and performers.
Trailer for The Last Waltz.
Footage of the band performing their San Francisco Thanksgiving Day concert (including on-stage guest appearances from the rock and blues hall of fame) is interspersed with carefully structured interviews with band members. No flies on the wall here. Scorsese has subsequently reprised this retrospective mode with his documentaries on Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones.
In effectively removing the concert hall audience from the The Last Waltz, Scorsese was crossing a line. The dynamic connection between stage and crowd that provides a key point of identification for the cinema audience is lost.
The originators of the concert film in the 1960s (filmmakers D.A. Pennebaker and the Maysles brothers) were acutely interested in that emotional connection. Pennebaker’s Don’t Look Back (1967) followed Bob Dylan’s 1965 tour of the UK, documenting fans’ reactions as the “folk singer” went electric. He inaugurated the rock festival film with Monterey Pop (1967) capturing now iconic stage performances by Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix and The Who. His concert film of David Bowie’s last performance as Ziggy Stardust was released, belatedly, in 1979.
After their 1964 coverage of The Beatles first American tour (What’s Happening! The Beatles in the USA), the Maysles were lured back to the music scene by the Rolling Stones in 1969 to chart their US tour. This culminated in the fateful Altamont Speedway concert at which an audience member was killed in front of the stage.
Gimme Shelter (1970), co-directed by Charlotte Zwerin, subverts the chronological narrative by filming band members’ reactions as the tensions rise and the gig descends into chaos and violence. Part concert film (featuring performances from Madison Square Garden early on the tour), Gimme Shelter’s musical pretext is taken over by an examination of the factors that led to its ultimate tragedy.
Gimme Shelter and Michael Wadleigh’s subsequent Woodstock (1970) film are works of forensic anthropology. They weren’t made to sell records, but to record a sub-culture in all its doomed glory.
Trailer for Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé.
More recent concert films, from Madonna: Truth or Dare (1991) and Kylie’s Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour (2005), to Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour and the forthcoming Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé demonstrate a more direct engagement with fans in cinemas by powerful female artists in total control of the medium of film.
These artists are using their films not only to boost recording sales but to promote their future tour dates. Furthermore, these films act as a consolation for those fans worldwide for whom a concert ticket is beyond reach. At £20 it was a pricy movie, but a cheap gig.
In this way, the concert film is enjoying a comeback in the age of event cinema, competing with a strike-beleagured Hollywood in the post-COVID box-office revival. Only not at my local on a Sunday night.

"Hugh Gray was taking his usual post-church walk around Loch Ness in Scotland on a November Sunday in 1933. His amble was disrupted when he saw something bobbing above the water two or three feet from him.
He quickly snapped several pictures of what he described to the Scottish Daily Record as “an object of considerable dimensions”.
A few months earlier, in April 1933, local hoteliers Aldie Mackay and her husband had described a whale-like beast to the Inverness Courier. Then, in the summer of 1933, a man called George Spicer stated: “I saw the nearest approach to a dragon or prehistoric animal that I have ever seen in my life.”
He described a creature between two and three metres long carrying “a lamb or animal of some kind” for its supper.
Since the first sightings, recorded in the latter half of the sixth century, the beast was considered a folk tale. However, when Gray captured the bobbing mass with an animal-like tail it was considered the first photographic proof of “Nessy” and inspired a sort of monster mania.
It’s 90 years since this picture and the beginning of the obsession with finding the Loch Ness monster. As a paleobiologist, I want to explore whether the type of monster we believe Nessy to be could exist and if we should continue looking.
An elaborate hoax?
There are a lot of fish in the loch, so there is enough food. There is also lots of space. Loch Ness is huge, with a volume of 7.4 billion cubic metres and a depth of 227m. There is a lot of water to hide in, which accounts for more than all the fresh water in all of the lakes of England and Wales.
Our idea of what the Loch Ness monster looks like is founded on an iconic picture taken a year after Gray’s. This image showed a long neck stretching from the black waters.
It is the source of the idea that the Loch Ness monster is a living relic from the time of the dinosaurs, eeking out a lonely existence in the depths. However, this image was not what it claimed to be and was found, decades later, to have been an elaborate hoax.
The famous picture, taken a year after the first, that shaped popular ideas about the way the Loch Ness monster looked was a fake. Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy
But there is evidence to support the existence of three-metre long beasties that looked a bit like the Loch Ness monster. These reptiles are known as plesiosaurs and they were wiped out in the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period.
Discoveries of plesiosaur fossils suggest they may have lived in freshwater. The fossils included bones and teeth from three-metre long adults and an arm bone from a 1.5 metre-long baby. However, it’s unlikely that the Loch Ness monster is a plesiosaur.
Unfortunately the truth comes down to biology. There might be enough food and enough space in the loch but what there is not enough of is other living Loch Ness-like monsters to make a viable population of animals to support Nessy’s existence.
So why look for Nessy or other monsters?
In August this year, Inverness played host to monster hunters scouring the loch with drones equipped with hydrophones and boats pinging sonar, all in the hope of proving the existence of Nessy. They didn’t find anything, which strongly suggests that Loch Ness remains monster-free.
Monster hunting mania is not reserved to the Loch Ness monster alone. The Mokele-mbembe is another a mythical water-dwelling beast that supposedly lives in the Congo River Basin and looks like a dinosaur. Like Nessy, I doubt it exists.
But I’m not a total party-pooper and I think people should continue their searches for seemingly extinct creatures. Take the thylacine, or Tasmanian wolf, for example. The last Tasmanian wolf was believed to have died in captivity in the 1930s.
However, recent research found that it’s possible the Tasmanian wolf went extinct much later than first thought and maybe hung on until the 2000s. In fact, researchers report that small groups of thylacines may have survived.

And sometimes animals we thought were extinct did come back to the modern world. The coelacanth is perhaps the most famous example.
This fish has a very long fossil record, from the Devonian period through to the end of the Cretaceous period. Then they were gone, thought lost in the same event that destroyed the dinosaurs and plesiosaurs. Not one fossil coelacanth has been described from Paleogene period sediments to today.
But in 1938 a single specimen, caught by fishermen, was found in a South African market by ichthyologist (a marine biologist who studies different fish species) Marjorie Courtney Latimer.
There followed a hunt for the next 20 years to find the population (do read the excellent A Fish Caught in Time) and we now know of two Latimeriid coelacanths in populations around Indonesia and southern Africa.
The take home message of this is: don’t let anything put you off looking for excitement, or even monsters. You might just find something amazing.

"Kenya’s stock market recently suffered steep losses, making it the worst performing globally. The weak performance has persisted: the Nairobi Securities Exchange 20-share index stood at about 1420 on 10 November 2023, having fallen from 1509 on 29 September 2023, a drop of 6% over the six-week period. In better days, the index has risen above the psychological 5000 mark: for example, it was 5491 on 23 February 2015.
The stock market matters for the Kenyan public for several reasons. First, up to 70% of the retirement savings of Kenyans may be invested in the stock market. So the market’s weakness might inhibit retirement funds from meeting their pension obligations. Second, many Kenyan companies use the stock market to raise capital and weak market performance discourages them from doing so.
Given these benefits, it is important to understand reasons for stock market value fluctuations. Here, I discuss some possible reasons for the market’s dismal performance and suggest possible ways to reverse the trend.
What moves markets
Stock prices move in response to new information that conveys signals about the risks faced by investors. The new information may be something that an investor has uncovered, or that is known by company insiders (although trading on that knowledge is usually illegal), or that is announced publicly by an authority like the central bank.
New information may be about something unique to the company, or something that affects the entire market. New information about a company often affects the company’s price without affecting the market index. However, in small markets such as Kenya’s, where the market index may reflect the presence of a few large companies (such as Safaricom and KCB), changes in the price of one firm’s stock may cause a noticeable change on the index value.
What ails Kenya’s stock market?
An important risk factor that affects the entire market is sovereign (country) risk. Sovereign risk may be responsible for the persistent selling off of shares by international investors at the Nairobi bourse in recent months.
When there are more investors selling shares than those willing to buy, share prices, and the market index, fall. This is because sellers must lower their prices to appeal to the few buyers. In 2022, Kenya’s international investors sold about US$158 million (KES 24 billion) worth of shares, slightly lower than the US$191 million recorded during 2020.
The sell-off may indicate deep-seated political issues affecting Kenya’s economy. These include fears of possible instability post-2022 presidential elections. The country has previously experienced election related violence.
The sell-off may also speak to economic factors. For instance, when US interest rates increase, as they have, international investors tend to pull their money out of developing markets and invest it in US debt markets, a phenomenon called flight to quality.
Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests that emerging stock markets slumped to their lowest between March and September 2023 driven by expectations that US interest rates would remain high.
Third, the stock market jitters may be explained by the weakening Kenyan shilling. For international investors, investing in a Kenyan stock means taking a risk on both the stock and the value of the Kenyan shilling. If the shilling falls in value relative to the investor’s domestic currency (like the US dollar), it may wipe out all the gains on the stock and cause the investor to lose money.
The Kenya shilling lost 21% of its value between 13 September 2022 and 10 November 2023. This has been largely attributed to capital flight and reduced inflow of foreign currency due to the low value of exports.
Then there’s Kenya’s burgeoning public debt. It’s the chicken-and-egg story: a falling shilling increases the burden of debt owed to outside lenders. And the rising cost of servicing debt in a foreign currency increases the supply of the shilling in the currency markets, weakening it further.
In an attempt to stem the slide in the shilling’s value, keep domestic inflation in check, and respond to rising US interest rates, Central Bank of Kenya, like its counterparts globally, has chosen to restrict money supply.
Consequently, the central bank rate, a policy interest rate that guides domestic loan pricing, has increased from 7% in March 2022 to 10.5% in November 2023. When interest rates rise, returns (yields) on debt assets like bonds also rise, making them more attractive than stocks. This induces investors to move their money from stocks to bonds, causing a decline in stock prices.
Expectations
An important recent development is the enactment of Kenya’s Finance Act in June 2023. The Act imposes new taxes and tax increases. The World Bank has warned that higher taxation may discourage investment and increase unemployment.
So there’s an expectation of weaker economic performance and, concomitantly, weaker company performance (due, for example, to lower product demand). The expectation of weaker company performance causes investors to anticipate lower future cash flows (like dividends), which is reflected in lower company valuations today.
Expectations about public debt also matter for companies. Kenya is expected to borrow more, which will increase interest rates on government debt, making it more lucrative for banks to lend to the government than to the private sector. Reduced private sector lending discourages private investments and lowers company valuations.
What should be done?
There is no quick fix to a stock market collapse. Although stock market performance may be driven by sentiment in the short run, it is more beneficial to think long-term.
There’s a close relationship between the broader economy and the stock market. So, as a finance scholar, I offer only one recommendation: diversify and grow the economy.
There is clear evidence of the long-term economic growth benefits of investing in human capital, boosting a country’s entrepreneurial orientation and investing in infrastructure. To grow the economy, therefore, the government’s policymakers should draw from such evidence.
Importantly, the need to strengthen the country’s institutions has never been stronger. This will have the effect of improving governance and accountability as well as investor confidence. With such actions, the stock market needs no intervention.",Kenya’s stock market has suffered steepest losses in the world: an expert view on why and how to reverse it,business + economy
"Fragile and least developed countries have had their development assistance cut drastically, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. For instance, net official development assistance to sub-Saharan African countries has shrunk by 7.8% compared to 2021. And development aid for peace and conflict prevention has declined to its lowest in 15 years.
These cuts will hit fragile countries hard. Fragile countries make up 24% of the world’s population and account for 73% of the world’s extreme poor. The list includes Mali, Lebanon, Somalia, Syria and Iraq.
Budget cuts are already having far-reaching effects and fuelling humanitarian crises. The World Food Programme estimates that “every one percent cut in food assistance risks pushing more than 400,000 people towards the brink of starvation”.
UN secretary-general António Guterres has warned that aid cuts threaten to undo gains in development. Keeping in mind that poverty has increased in conflict-affected countries despite a global downward trend, we anticipate that such a reversal could contribute to global instability.
Violent conflict has already been on the rise among countries that rely heavily on foreign financial assistance. Decades of research (including ours) show that marginalised populations are most vulnerable to be (re-)mobilised into fighting and are typically also most affected by armed conflict (even after violence ends).
It is true that political and societal context matters and needs to be taken into account. But the reduction in aid allocation to least developed countries and especially those recovering from violent conflict could put fragile countries on a trajectory of (renewed) political instability and underdevelopment. Already vulnerable populations will have to yet again carry the brunt of new cycles of violence and impoverishment.
We have been researching links between development and violent conflict for decades and close to a decade, respectively. Our latest research project is on the institutional legacies of violent conflict. It shows how and why violent conflicts persist, how and why their legacies endure, and what can be done to reduce the risk and impact of violence. We recommend that development aid needs to correspond more closely with mounting peacebuilding and humanitarian needs in fragile settings.
The impact
Not all development aid is effective in bringing stability or building peace. Nevertheless, based on our analysis, development aid plays a crucial role in six key areas.
Firstly, development aid is effective when linked to the delivery of public services. These in turn strengthen the social contract and mitigate the risk of violence.
Secondly, financial assistance can help governments absorb the effects of economic shocks. Economies across the global south are already stifled by the aftermath of the COVID pandemic, climate risks and the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine. Fragile countries often rely on assistance to meet some of their population’s most basic needs such as food or water.
Without additional financial assistance many governments will not be able to manage their way through these shocks. That may embolden violent non-state actors to gain power.
Two examples stand out. In west Africa violent non-state actors operating in the Sahel region are set to expand their influence into new areas considered stable thus far, such as the north of Côte d’Ivoire.
Similarly, the current Israel-Palestine conflict risks spreading instability into neighbouring countries amid longstanding tensions and economic fragility.
Thirdly, cuts in development aid may reduce the limited leverage western countries still have to prevent the rise of opportunistic armed groups such as the Wagner Group, the spread of extremism and the risk of civil conflicts.
The Sahel region is also emblematic for this dynamic. Mali and Burkina Faso have seen the deadliest year on record as their military transitional governments struggle to contain jihadist insurgencies. Since the recent military coup in Niger, which prompted withdrawal of both aid and international troops, the country has also experienced a surge in militant violence.
Fourth, worsening economic and security conditions in fragile and least developed countries are already reverberating into Europe. There have been spikes in irregular border crossings into European Union countries in 2023.
Fifth, rising discrepancy in development aid allocation could amplify mistrust in international institutions and western actors. That could contribute to worsening security situations. Some governments in fragile countries are already reluctant to continue to engage with the UN and especially western actors to combat violent non-state actors.
An example of this is the Democratic Republic of Congo’s recent request to the UN for an “accelerated” withdrawal of troops. It comes 24 years after the start of Monusco, the UN’s peacekeeping mission in DRC, one of the largest in the world. Violence may increase in the absence of such international intervention, as has happened since the withdrawal of Minusma, the UN mission that was in Mali for ten years.
Sixth, the reduction in aid allocation to least developed countries and especially those recovering from violent conflict could result in continued political instability and underdevelopment.
Next steps
Development funding should be allocated in a way that corresponds more closely with peacebuilding and humanitarian needs. This is also made clear in the UN’s New Agenda for Peace. It calls for action now to
reinforce the cooperative frameworks that are necessary to move us from the path to destruction to the path to prosperity … based on a reforged commitment to multilateral solutions, grounded on trust, solidarity and universality.
Correcting course in aid allocation could address some of the growing mistrust among developing countries and support prospects for peace.","Development aid cuts will hit fragile countries hard, could fuel violent conflict",business + economy
"To what extent does private investment help developing countries to reduce conflict and violence and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals?
This is a hotly debated issue. Most international institutions such as the World Bank Group take the stance that the problem is not enough private investment. So they mobilise public resources to subsidise and protect private sector actors with the goal of greatly increasing foreign direct investment.
Meanwhile, community, labour and human rights advocates – particularly in fragile and conflict-affected countries – tend instead to see the dominant patterns of foreign direct investment as part of a continuing history of exploitation of the developing world.
To help shed light on this debate, we undertook a comprehensive study of thousands of projects of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group. We focused on the period between 1994 and 2022.
We chose the IFC because it claims to invest with developmental purpose. It also purports to apply the highest standards of social and environmental performance. Additionally, many other private and public actors follow its lead in setting standards. If the IFC is getting it wrong it would be a good indicator of how things stand in the broader global system. We focused our study on the relationship between IFC projects and armed conflict, as violence has a clear and detrimental effect on human development.
The results establish that IFC projects cause significant increases in armed conflict around the world. A single project, on average, causes 7.6 additional armed conflict events in the year after it is introduced. These findings are consistent with other large quantitative studies that question the relationship between foreign direct investment and development. Foreign direct investment that increases violent conflict and makes development nearly impossible appears the rule, not the exception.
We conclude that current approaches to foreign investment need urgent reconsideration, with particular focus on the risk of violent conflict.
Our methodology
Many factors influence violent conflict, including the history of intergroup and state-society relations. So the study used sophisticated econometric analyses to isolate the IFC’s impact.
We first geolocated IFC projects and noted the years in which they were approved. Then we tested whether armed conflict rose in the area proximate to the IFC project in the following year. We controlled for other factors – such as the presence of politically excluded groups, GDP, the regime type, or the population size – that affect conflict.
In the analysis, we were careful to match and compare an IFC project area with those areas without IFC projects to which it is most similar. Finally, we considered and controlled for the possibility that conflict was already rising before the IFC project arrived. By excluding these other explanations for conflict events, we were able to make reasonable causal attributions.

Disturbingly, the study found that increases in armed conflict were concentrated in projects that the IFC told local and international stakeholders had potential limited adverse environmental or social risks. It claimed that these could be readily addressed through mitigation measures. These mitigation measures appear to be either ineffective or under-employed. Alternatively, the IFC is mis-classifying projects that carry more substantial conflict risk than it recognises or cares to make public.
One particularly disturbing example is the Ugandan government’s campaign of terror against local citizens to turn land over to an IFC client. The IFC also has yet to resolve activists’ complaints from 2019 of gender-based violence and threats of reprisals and intimidation against one of its project partners, Salala Rubber Corporation in Liberia.
The study also demonstrated that capital-intensive projects (that is, agribusiness, oil, gas, mining and infrastructure) have a larger propensity for socio-political and socio-economic disruption. Areas that receive capital-intensive projects experience, on average, an additional death from armed conflict in the following year.
Not above the rule of law
These results should perhaps not be surprising. Civil society groups have long concluded that the IFC prioritises its own profits and business interests over the “suffering of others” in ways that contribute to “multiple paths of extraction, dispossession, and conflict”. In 2020 Human Rights Watch characterised the IFC as “failing at remedies for project abuses”. This was based on the World Bank Group’s own commissioned review.
Read more: Cautious welcome: World Bank and IMF return to Africa, but questions remain
Yet, the IFC’s strategy has been to position itself above the rule of law. It continues to assert sovereign immunity. It claims that, as an international organisation, it should not be liable in national courts – even to parties it admittedly harms.
It maintains this stance despite recent reports of IFC complicity in covering up the sexual abuse of children to further its investment projects.
It appears beyond time for the 186 member governments that own the IFC to demand transparency, accountability and redress for harms done from the corporation and the private sector actors it funds. Others can also play a role. Governments that have perhaps naively relied on the World Bank halo should question the benefits they are told they can expect from IFC investments. The ratings agencies that classify IFC bonds as positive from an environmental, social, and governance perspective may want to question the bases on which such determinations are made.
At the same time, perhaps more credence can be given to recent calls by the UN secretary general to reform the global financial system to better support human security and human development.
This could include specialised intermediaries between the IFC and sensitive projects in difficult places. Independent and empowered local oversight appears necessary to ensure more inclusive and accountable forms of contextual analysis and risk mitigation planning, monitoring and evaluation of development impact, proactive conflict management, and accessible redress for harms done.

The outbreaks pose a major challenge for South Africa’s domestic animal farming sector. Fears of weaknesses in the system have been raised by agribusiness for some time, suggesting that pressures and concerns are mounting.
Biosecurity breaches are not unique to South Africa. They have become a significant challenge globally. It’s not easy to put a monetary figure on it, but reports of disease outbreaks across the world, and indeed in South Africa, suggest the problem has intensified.
In South Africa, reports about foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, African swine fever in pigs and avian influenza in poultry have become frequent. But few countries have had to deal with these disease outbreaks almost simultaneously, as South Africa has.
In 2022, six of South Africa’s nine provinces reported foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. This was the first time in the country’s history that the disease had been spread this wide.
The situation remains critical.
All these outbreaks have had a notable impact on South African agricultural exports, and the growth prospects of the sector. For example, South Africa’s beef exports for 2022 were down by 12% year-on-year, according to data from Trade Map. This decline was primarily due to the temporary closures of various export markets following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in South Africa. Farmers are being hit hard.
Livestock and poultry account for roughly half of agriculture’s gross value added.
Based on this history and the experiences of the agricultural sector, there is concern that South Africa’s biosecurity breaches signal serious capacity challenges in farm biosecurity measures and the country’s veterinary and related support services (mainly the laboratories) that control the movement of livestock and vaccine production.
The South African government, organised agriculture and industry bodies should work together closely to address the country’s biosecurity challenges.
Disease outbreaks
On 4 November this year, the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development announced it was investigating a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in one district.
This means the issue that was identified a year ago remains a challenge. These outbreaks weigh heavily on the cattle industry’s fortunes. The beef industry accounts for a sizable share of the South African agricultural economy, and is positioned to absorb new entrant farmers in the sector. Beef exports were about 1% of agricultural exports, valued at US$151 million, in 2022, according to Trade Map.
The sheep industry was also affected by the 2022 outbreak. China, a significant market for South African wool, suspended imports. This resulted in a 21% year-on-year decline in the export value of wool in 2022, to US$337 million, according to Trade Map data. Wool still made up 3% of South Africa’s record agricultural export value of US$12.8 billion in 2022.
China’s official reason for the suspension was the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. But it might not be all that clear cut. China may also have had capacity issues at its ports at the time because of the tail-end effects of COVID-19 and the restrictions there.
China has a unique protocol to handle wool shipments and avoid any contamination during a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in South Africa. This was agreed in 2019 after an outbreak.
In 2022 South Africa’s pig industry was put under fresh pressures. Towards the end of the year outbreaks of African swine fever were reported. The disease remains a challenge.
Most recently, the focus has been on avian influenza. More than a hundred commercial poultry facilities have reported cases. There are major losses for breeders of layers and broilers. As a result, there has been a spike in imports of fertilised eggs to rebuild the parent stock flock. This is key for stabilising the industry.

Major producers have announced serious losses. Consumers are also seeing a rise in the price of eggs.
Policy considerations
The growth prospects of farming businesses remain at risk if there are no material improvements in biosecurity. This is particularly true for sub-sectors that are crucial for inclusive growth. For example, the National Agricultural Marketing Council estimates suggest that black farmers account for 18%, 13% and 34% of wool, mohair and cattle production, respectively.
The department of land and agriculture should consider earmarking a share of its annual budget for emergencies to deal with biosecurity risks. These funds should be used only in the case of notifiable animal disease outbreaks and under strict rules and in concurrence with the South African National Treasury. This will be necessary to control animal movements, procure vaccines and permit vaccination in certain areas, employ additional staff and compensate producers when animals must be culled.
Notably, the government should also work the private sector on vaccine manufacturing as national laboratories have experienced failures in the recent past, thus weakening disease control efforts. Additionally, government should increase the number of veterinarians and animal health technicians.
Also necessary is the repair and maintenance of international fences, which fail to keep wild animals and infected animals from neighbouring countries out of South Africa. Collaboration between Public Works and the National Treasury in this respect is critical.
In essence, most interventions require better management, coordination, restructuring of departments, and investment in fencing, new laboratory equipment and vaccine production.
Beyond the technical matters, the relationship between the regulators and farmers should also be improved so that disease outbreaks can be managed collaboratively with no hostility.",Diseases on farms in South Africa: recent outbreaks point to weaknesses in the system,business + economy
"President William Ruto of Kenya recently announced that Kenya’s borders would be open to visitors from the entirety of Africa, with no visas required, by the end of 2023. He said
When people cannot travel, business people cannot travel, entrepreneurs cannot travel, we all become net losers.
A few days later, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda followed suit, saying all Africans would be able to enter Rwanda without visas.
Neither Kenya nor Rwanda will be the first. By the end of 2022, Benin, The Gambia and Seychelles had already implemented a system of visa-free access for all Africans. Perhaps more will follow soon. Some regions, some sub-regional groups and some bilateral arrangements have also resulted in visa-free access and even passport-free access in certain cases.
Within the broader East African Community, Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya allow cross border travel without passports. Botswana and Namibia recently signed a similar agreement.
Despite this progress, by the end of 2022 only 27% of African routes allowed Africans to travel visa-free.
Actions such as those of Kenya and Rwanda take the African Union’s agenda further. Regularising freer movement of people across African borders is one of the continent’s great developmental challenges. It is one of the flagship projects of the African Union’s Agenda 2063.
But even if all African countries no longer required visas from Africans, this would not necessarily give the visitors a right to apply for jobs, establish a business or build a home in the receiving country. The 2018 African Union Free Movement of Persons protocol aims for full free movement, through three phases – entry, residence and establishment. This includes full economic rights, including employment. It has not been widely ratified, however.
Our new study of migration trends underscores the potential contributions of migration to economic development in the countries of origin and destination. This is realised through the transfer of skills, knowledge and remittances. The study also shows that intra-African migration is firmly rooted in geographical, social and economic ties. Movement is predominantly within regions, and moderately between them.
Free trade and movement of people
African Union policies support freer intracontinental trade, investment and movement of people to promote the continent’s economic, social and political development. The continent has made progress on the aspects of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement that deal with trade and investment. There hasn’t been much progress on the free movement of people. And yet the success of the trade agreement requires freer movement of people.
This interdependence between trade and free movement of people was the focus of the recent Pan-African Forum on Migration held in Gaborone, the Botswana capital. The forum brings together African Union member states, the continent’s regional economic communities, UN agencies and intergovernmental organisations to deliberate on migration and human mobility issues in Africa.
Read more: Free movement of people across Africa: regions are showing how it can work
The conference noted that most African countries had failed to ratify the African Union’s Free Movement of Persons protocol. At the same time, there was evidence of improvements in policies and practices at national, bilateral and multilateral levels that facilitate the freer movement of Africans.
Apart from recent announcements by Rwanda and Kenya, other instances would be a growing number of reciprocal arrangements between countries.
Regional migration a norm
The history of African statehood, with strong social ties across national boundaries, makes regional mobility a norm rather than an exception. This can be seen from the migration routes, mostly found within the same regions and which proceed in both directions.
For example, Burkina Faso to Côte d’Ivoire is the largest migrant route in the continent and within the Economic Community of West Africa (Ecowas) – the economic bloc of 15 west African states. Côte d’Ivoire to Burkina Faso is equally popular. This trend is ubiquitous throughout the continent, except within the Southern African Development Community region, where most migrant routes tend to lead to South Africa.
Among the major regional economic communities, Ecowas has the most intense regional migration. It is followed by the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community. By contrast, Ecowas has the least inter-regional migration while the East African Community has the most.
Variations in development across Africa mean that some countries experience contrasting patterns, particularly in extra-continental migration. While most African migrants migrate to and from other parts of the continent, in middle income countries such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria extra-continental emigration is greater.
Immigration and emigration are generally low in low income countries and higher in middle income countries. In rich countries, people tend not to emigrate. The relatively low level of migration in Africa follows this pattern.
Only 14% of total world emigrants come from Africa. The average migrant density, or percentage of migrants living on the continent, is 1.89% compared to a global average of 3.6% where Europe and North America are at 12% and 16% respectively. African migration is thus not only comparatively low compared with the global averages, but characteristically depicts low income.
High income countries tend to have more immigrants than emigrants. The converse is true for low income regions. Africa as a whole has more emigrants than immigrants, confirming the link between migration and development.
Legal restrictions matter little
Much migration in Africa is impervious to legal constrictions or definitions of national boundaries, and even to logistical constraints. Government dictates succeed in making much of this migration irregular but fail to stop it. Though regional integration and liberalisation of migration rules are helpful, they do not yet solve this challenge.
The main migrant sending country to Kenya is Somalia, despite not being in the same regional economic community. And despite efforts by the government of Kenya to deter Somali migrants to Kenya. The main destination country for Nigerian emigrants in Africa is Cameroon, even though it does not belong to Ecowas.
While African migration governance reforms are making considerable progress it will still be a while till they catch up and are able to deal fairly and rationally with the reality of migration patterns in Africa.

"African governments are seeking an extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) beyond 2025. The law was enacted in 2000 to “encourage increased trade and investment between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa”. We asked David Luke, who specialises in African trade policy and trade negotiations, what benefits Agoa has brought for qualifying African countries and how it can be improved.
To what extent has the Agoa goal been achieved?
The duty- and quota-free access to the US market granted by Agoa has helped in boosting trade and investment between sub-Saharan Africa and the US. Many of the qualifying African countries have recorded specific successes in goods exported under Agoa to the US. These include textiles and apparel from Kenya, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Lesotho, Ghana and Madagascar. In Kenya, for instance, the apparel-dominated Agoa sales have grown from US$55 million in 2001 to US$603 million in 2022, accounting for 67.6% of the country’s total exports to the US.
South Africa has sub-Saharan Africa’s most diversified export list. The value of its automotive sales to the US has increased by 447.3% between 2001 and 2022 under Agoa. South Africa’s vehicle exports to the US increased by 1,643.6% in the first year of Agoa, from 853 units in 2000 to 14,873 units in 2001.
Other country specific successes include Ghana where non-oil products like plant roots, textiles and travel goods are accessing the US market under Agoa. Ghana’s exports to the US grew from US$206 million in 2000 to US$2.76 bilion in 2022, though only 26% of this trade was under Agoa.
The Agoa window has also lifted chocolate and basket-weaving materials from Mauritius; buckwheat, travel goods and musical instruments from Mali (suspended in 2022); Mozambique’s sugar, nuts and tobacco; and Togo’s wheat, legumes and fruit juices.
Perhaps Ethiopia, which was suspended from Agoa in January 2022, best exemplifies the impact of the trade window on Africa’s industrialisation.
According to the World Bank, Ethiopia has attracted the world’s attention with its ambitious industrialisation plans, particularly through its industrial parks. The industrial parks, which mainly produce textiles and garments, have thrived on the duty-free and quota-free access to the US market.
In less than a decade, Ethiopia’s industrial parks created 90,000 direct jobs, predominantly for women aged 18 to 25 years. Employment of this group is typically associated with a range of positive societal and economic spillovers.
Ethiopia’s exports to the US increased from US$29 million to US$525 million in 2020, 45.3% of it under Agoa. Textile and garment exports that up to 2014 accounted for just 10% of the trade grew steadily to 69% over the period.
The industrial parks attracted 66 foreign firms investing about US$740 million since 2014/15, with Agoa as the major driver of the sector’s investment and growth of its jobs and export earnings.
What’s been the impact of Agoa on Africa’s exports?
Between 2017 and 2020, the US became the third largest destination for Africa’s industrial products after the European Union and intra-African trade. Agoa is part of the reason for this. That means Agoa has stimulated significant value addition in the region, traditionally known for exporting unprocessed items.
The positive impact on value chains explains why African countries such as Kenya, Lesotho and Mauritius have put so much diplomatic capital, and on occasion lobbying funding, into articulating a continuing case for Agoa’s renewal.
The African countries have exploited the window to sell their manufactured goods to the US. This is the kind of trade that really matters for Africa’s goal of economic transformation through “manufacturing, industrialisation and value addition”.
By comparison, during the 2017-2020 period, 87% of Africa’s exports to China were fuels, ores and metals.
What kind of agreement are the US and Kenya negotiating?
The US and Kenya are not negotiating a bilateral free trade area agreement as is commonly misunderstood. What they are negotiating is a strategic trade and investment partnership which cannot be described as a free trade agreement as it does not include new market access arrangements.
The main goal of the partnership is to increase investment and to promote inclusive economic growth. It is meant to benefit workers, consumers and businesses (including small ones). Its other aim is to support African regional economic integration.
Given the prevailing global economic disparities, if African countries are to develop, they need trade concessions like Agoa, not bilateral reciprocal free trade agreements.
How can Agoa be made more beneficial to sub-Saharan Africa?
First, Agoa must be extended for at least 20 years. This will ensure predictability of the market access concession and boost confidence among investors of a sufficient time frame to recoup investments. Second, north African countries ought to be included in Agoa. This will extend Agoa to all African countries and support the trade integration of the continent through the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement.
Thirdly, Agoa should stop punishing investors for mistakes of governments. It is unfortunate that countries that fail to meet the Agoa eligibility requirements, which include governance and human rights standards, are suspended from the scheme. This penalises private firms that invest and trade and the people who are dependent on these firms for jobs. But the US is not likely to change the eligibility requirements.",Africa-US trade: Agoa deal expires in 2025 - an expert unpacks what it’s achieved in 23 years,business + economy
"Inequality in South Africa is high, whether measured by income or wealth. One of the results is that there’s acute public scrutiny of executive compensation.
This is understandable given that the skew in rewards for executives compared with wages of workers is one of the key drivers of rising inequality – in South Africa and across the globe.
Drawing on recent publicly available data, we undertook a preliminary analysis comparing chief executive officer (CEO) pay with average monthly pay ratios in the country. In our analysis CEO pay included a base salary and a variety of benefits. We then compared the CEO’s pay to the overall average monthly earning provided by the country’s statistics agency, StatsSA.
StatsSA estimates show that the average monthly pay for all workers, regardless of their sector of employment, was R23,640 (about US$1,280). We acknowledge this number is a high figure, no doubt driven up by the dynamics of South Africa’s labour market – high unemployment levels and high income inequality. The high figure had the effect of lowering the pay ratios, making them look better than they might actually be.
Using a sample of companies across various sectors of the economy our analysis showed that CEOs earn between 150 and 949 times more than the average pay of all South African workers.
Our findings are important because they shed light on inequality within firms – a key component of inequality in society in general.
We submitted our findings to hearings in parliament on two bills tabled earlier this year – the Companies Amendment Bill and the Companies Second Amendment Bill. If passed, the bills would make it compulsory for companies to disclose their pay gap ratios. The aim is to encourage adequate disclosure so that all stakeholders have sufficient data to make informed decisions.
We are in favour of the bills because it will mean that companies can’t go on ignoring inequalities in earnings and wealth in South Africa. Disclosures will also provide other social actors with evidence to question inequalities within firms, and demand changes.
Our analysis differs from previous work. For example, one analysis focused only on pay ratios of companies in consumer products and services and another only on state-owned entities. There’s also a study that describes the relationship between corporate performance and CEO pay.
We saw a divergence between the earnings of CEOs employed at locally owned compared to transnational firms. There was also a difference between CEOs in privately owned companies and those at the helm of state-owned entities. We also found differences in earnings across and within sectors.
And we found there was a weak correlation between the CEO’s pay and their sector’s overall contribution to economic growth and employment share. For example, the remuneration gap in the mining sector is high yet the sector’s contribution to GDP and employment share has declined in the post-1994 period.
Changes to the law
The purpose of the bills tabled by trade and industry minister Ebrahim Patel is to improve the ease of doing business, clarify uncertainty and reduce bureaucratic red tape.
The changes also include clauses that would make remuneration disclosures mandatory for public companies and state-owned entities.
If the bills are passed, companies will be required to list the remuneration and total benefits received by the highest earning individual and the lowest earning employee.
Additionally, companies will be required to calculate a remuneration gap, defined as the ratio between the total remuneration of the top 5% highest paid individuals and that of the lowest paid 5%. This must be calculated at both the median and mean to avoid any distortion by outliers.
What’s missing
Based on our findings and the research we’re involved in, we argue that the bills don’t go far enough. There are gaps that need to be plugged for them to be truly effective.
The law should require firms to report the wages of the lowest paid person regardless of whether they are employed internally or outsourced. This isn’t the case at the moment.
This is important because employment growth in South Africa over the past 30 years has largely been in temporary employment services.
Pay disclosures in the US allow for both categories of workers by recommending that firms with more than 100 employees hired through a labour contractor should file two separate reports, one for individuals paid via the firm’s payroll and a separate one to include outsourced workers. South Africa should adopt a similar threshold.
Secondly, the current version of the amendment is a missed opportunity to legislate reporting on gender pay gaps at the firm level. This is already in place in Germany, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.
Despite an increase in female participation rates in the labour markets, female workers continue to face discrimination. Female workers earn R70 on average for every R100 earned by male workers. These pay disparities along gender lines persist even when we account for worker characteristics by including age, educational attainment levels, experience, sector or industry and occupational characteristics.
We recommend the inclusion of payment disclosures along gender lines.
Thirdly, it is important to include the base pay made to the highest and lowest earning individual together with any short- and long-term benefits. This is because in some industries the base pay is low relative to the total package earned by executives.
While it is important to include both base pay and other short- and long-term benefits, we believe that the listed payments are not exhaustive. We propose the inclusion of the following:
any tax-deductible expenses paid by the company on behalf of the highest and lowest paid individuals
compensation for loss of office paid to or received by any individual together with any other payments relating to termination of services.
The proposed amendments do not specifically state whether in addition an individual remuneration gap will be calculated between the highest and lowest earning individuals. We recommend that this calculation is specifically included.",South Africa’s wage gap is huge: why companies should report what CEOs and workers earn,business + economy
"The medium-term budget policy statement presented by South Africa’s finance minister, Enoch Godongwana, to parliament on 1 November 2023 is intended to provide a preview of government’s public finance plans over the next three years. It does not actually commit government to anything, either in law or in practice. Nevertheless, it is a crucial document because it presents what the National Treasury intends to be the broad, financial foundation for the functioning of national, provincial and local governments in the near future.
This year’s statement is particularly important for two reasons. The first is that South Africa’s fiscal situation is arguably at its worst in the post-apartheid era. The second is that any decisions taken, especially about the 2024/25 fiscal year, could affect how South Africans view the current government when voting in next year’s elections.
The crucial background to this year’s statement is that South Africa’s national debt levels relative to the size of the economy have increased substantially since 2008. The statement emphasises that the increase was approximately 47 percentage points from 2008. The three main reasons are the global financial crisis that started in 2007, continued slow economic growth partly as a result of state capture and power outages, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Additional reasons include lower tax collection, other major expenditure increases such as the “free higher education” policy announced unexpectedly at the end of 2017, and large transfers to the state-owned power utility Eskom in response to its worsening financial position.
As things stand, national debt is expected to reach almost 75% of GDP by next year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic such levels would have been considered unsustainable by many economists and international financial institutions. The sustainability of national debt – how much a country can borrow without leading to a crisis later – drives a lot of thinking about country’s public finances.
But it’s not a science. What was almost unthinkable about debt levels before the COVID-19 pandemic has now become almost normal. Many countries have experienced large increases in their overall debt levels and the resultant debt service costs.
Some so-called radical economists claim that there are few limits on government expenditure. But this is, unfortunately, a luxury that may only be true for much wealthier countries with greater economic and political power – like the US.
On the other side of the spectrum, recent scaremongering statements that the country could “run out of cash” are absurd and misleading.
The question for South Africa is what to do about high and growing levels of debt. A sustainable debt path isn’t just about reducing debt to a particular level. The process of how it’s done is also crucial. Cutting spending in a way that creates social harm and reduces economic growth is self-defeating. Raising taxes too much can also be counter-productive. But letting debt rise indefinitely will mean borrowing costs become impossible to meet without dramatic spending or taxation measures.
The result inevitably involves difficult trade-offs. But because these are contested, within government and by different interest groups, the consequences and details are often concealed or given a misleading spin.
The devil in the detail
A few examples from this year’s statement illustrate this – and the divisions within government itself.
The first is the issue of government spending on salaries.
In the past the National Treasury and some economists have sought to suggest that this kind of spending is inherently “unproductive”. In reality, even from a narrow economic perspective, that is incorrect. Such spending funds the work of teachers who are responsible for educating future generations, nurses whose job includes keeping people in the labour market healthy and alive, and police officers whose presence should contribute to keeping crime in check.
For many years there has been an arm-wrestling match between the treasury and other parts of government responsible for determining public sector wage agreements. The way this has been “resolved” is by the treasury budgeting for the wage increases it believes are appropriate, the other parts of government agreeing to higher wage agreements, and the treasury then forcing departments to cut the total number of employees in order to keep total wage costs down.
Although the treasury accompanies its stance by promising that “essential” or “labour intensive” departments and sectors will be protected, it has never provided any detailed information to actually show that is happening. The consequence is a form of “austerity by stealth” in relation to staff available to provide public services.
The much better solution would have been for a social compact on wage increases and public sector employment. That would require compromise from the treasury but also public sector trade unions. Unable to reach that kind of mature solution, the arm-wrestling continues every year with the general public being the losers.
This year the treasury budgeted for an increase of less than 2% but the actual outcome was 7.5%. Some of this will be covered by funds taken from other important expenditure items, while the rest will come from cutting public sector posts.
A seemingly positive development is that the statement now makes provision for a continuation of the Social Relief of Distress Grant that was introduced during COVID-19. This is one of the only sources of support to millions of South Africans who are unable to find employment.
The 2023 budget made no provision for the continuation of the grant: the treasury planned to end it in March 2024, immediately before the 2024 elections. Earlier this year I argued to Parliament that such a decision would be inequitable and could also unduly influence electoral outcomes.
While it seems sense has prevailed with treasury now planning more than R50 billion ($2.65bn) for such spending over the next two years, it remains to be seen what is proposed in the 2024 budget.
Another example relates to crucial public employment programmes. In a recent speech the president cited his Presidential Employment Initiative as a major success – although without providing any detailed evidence. The treasury proposes to extend this to 2024/25, which seems like a good thing. But it plans to do so by cannibalising funds for other public employment schemes like the Expanded Public Works Programme and Community Works Programme: arguably a case of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. And it seems intent on continuing the costly and ineffective Employment Tax Incentive.
Lastly, there is the thorny issue of taxes. The major cause of an increase in national debt levels this year is a shortfall in taxation revenue of almost R60 billion ($3.2bn). Only if you read the detail in the medium term budget statement does it turn out that a large part of this is due to private sector investment in decentralised renewable energy generation capacity. This isn’t fully explained, but is likely to be due to value added tax refunds linked to tax incentives introduced in the 2023 budget. In other words: it is the result of a policy proposed by the treasury itself.
Watch this space
While the minister and the treasury have provided an indication of current thinking, the crucial details and commitments of government’s fiscal plans will only be clear when the budget itself is tabled next year. And those will only be cemented when approved by Parliament.

"Over the past few months, South Africa’s power generation sector has performed better than expected. Four factors explain this: an acceleration of solar power installations, less frequent breakdowns at power stations, a less restricted supply of diesel and the return to operation of some units at Kusile coal fired power station.
Throughout most of this year South Africa experienced prolonged and damaging electricity shortages, making 2023 the worst year to date. The power utility Eskom confirmed this in its annual results presentation, in which it said: “Eskom’s generating plant availability reached the lowest levels ever, due to unprecedented levels of unplanned unavailability.”
The percentage of functional power generating capacity, which was typically around 90% in the 1990s, has dropped over the past few years. It was between 50% and 60% for most of 2023.
Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, the country’s minister of electricity (a post created recently to deal with the electricity problems) has declared that the worst of the crisis is over, and that power cuts will soon be a thing of the past.
Is he right? Is the government’s optimism justified?
There is certainly reason to be pleased that the 2023 winter electricity shortfalls were less grave than expected, and that Eskom has booked some recent successes in its efforts to stave off further declines. But it’s too early to claim a turnaround, which requires fundamental medium-term measures and reforms.
Mitigating factors
In the last year, a number of factors have assisted in mitigating the power crisis.
Firstly, an acceleration of private solar power installations. The acute power shortfalls triggered a long overdue drive towards private solar rooftop installations. The move was boosted by government-promoted tax incentives and loan schemes.
According to estimates provided by Eskom, the capacity of private solar installations has risen by 349% between March 2022 and June 2023. The total peak generating capacity of these was in June 2023 expected to be almost 4,500 MW. As solar energy generation is limited to daytime sunny conditions, this translates to about 1,200 MW on average.
Secondly, less frequent breakdowns at the coal power station fleet, apparently linked to a decrease in sabotage activity.
The previous Eskom CEO claimed to have uncovered evidence of massive sabotage at power plants. While the scale of such sabotage is uncertain, it is likely that at least some has occurred.
There have been several arrests. Instances of breakdown have been lower in recent months (although breakdowns are still extraordinarily high). Together with plant repairs, the effects have been to reduce unplanned outages by about 2,000 MW.
Thirdly, a less restricted supply of diesel.
In 2022 the power crisis deepened when Eskom ran short of funds to purchase diesel. The power stations where electricity is generated from burning diesel are only envisaged as a backup during acute shortages, but have been kept running longer than intended.
Assisted by government taking over half of its debt, Eskom has a much higher budget of R27.9 billion for diesel purchases (about US$1.6 billion) for the current financial year. Half of this amount has already been spent.
Lastly, the return to service of some of the damaged Kusile coal power station units. This plant could, if fully operational, contribute about 15% of the country’s electricity needs.
The scale of the power shortage in the last year was largely due to multiple failures at Kusile. Kusile is the country’s newest large plant, but nine years after its initially projected completion date, two of its six units have still not been finished.
In October 2022 Kusile lost three of its units, or 2,400 MW, due to a collapse of the flue ducts. Two of these were restored in the last month, albeit with much higher than usually permitted emission levels. These additional 1,600 MW now available, and the 2,400 MW from the remaining three units projected to come into service in the coming year, are the main reason for the minister’s optimism.
On the down side, lengthy closures will be needed at some point to properly fix the flue ducts. It is also worrying that Kusile and the new Medupi plant have experienced so many failures already.
Persistent dangers
There are nevertheless signs that the recovery of the power generating sector is still far off.
The biggest threat is that the ageing and overworked coal plant fleet remains vulnerable to breakdowns.
Secondly, the life extension project for the country’s sole nuclear power plant, Koeberg, is progressing far too slowly. Calls for its closure are gaining traction.
Koeberg’s operating licence expires in July 2024. If not renewed, Koeberg’s two units would have to be closed for good. That would result in a 4% drop in the country’s generating capacity.
To extend this licence for 20 years, the National Nuclear Regulator has requested significant plant upgrades and component replacements. This was in 2010 projected to cost R20 billion (US$2.8 billion at the time) and require five months’ down time for each unit.
Given bad planning and delays so far, it is unlikely that work will be completed by the licence expiry date.
Thirdly, delays in the drafting of a revised national electricity plan highlight sharp disagreement within government on the solution.
Electricity generating infrastructure planning in South Africa is guided by Integrated Resource Plans that are supposed to be redone every two years. The country is currently using a plan approved in 2019.
The next plan is therefore already two years late, and its release for public comment has been promised for many months. The latest September release date was also missed.
The delays probably reflect unhappiness in parts of the ruling party with a path that emphasises renewable energy. The minister of mining and energy, whose department is responsible for the energy plan, is known to favour power generation from coal, gas and nuclear.
What’s needed
Without strategic alignment on how to address the electricity crisis, government won’t be able to develop new power plants. The old coal plants will not be as efficient as 20 years ago, and high breakdown levels will persist.
It therefore remains unlikely that South Africa’s electricity problems will end in the short to medium term.",South Africa power outages: some improvement but a long way to go before the grid is stable,business + economy
"South Africa must tread carefully in its economic relationships to avoid being caught in the escalating tension between east and west, and more specifically China and the US. The country’s hosting, and the outcome, of the 2023 Agoa Summit should strengthen its role in diplomatic relations and contribute towards safeguarding the country’s economic interests.
From 2-4 November 2023, the US and 35 sub-Saharan African countries will meet in Johannesburg for the 20th Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum (Agoa Forum). It entails strengthening trade and investment ties between the US and sub-Saharan Africa through the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), US legislation which provides various trade preferences to eligible countries in the region.
Given Russia’s continuing war in Ukraine and its rising tension with Nato, plus the China-US trade war, tensions between east and west are high. South Africa has come under attack for its non-alignment role in the Ukraine war. It refused to support UN resolutions condemning Russia. This resulted in some US congressmen pushing for the forum to be moved out of South Africa.
The country recently hosted the 15th Brics summit, which resolved to expand the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa grouping to 11 member states. The enlargement will bolster Brics’ role as a geopolitical alternative to the west, which is dominated by the US. Might this be a direct challenge to American hegemony?
I have been researching major global economic developments, such as globalisation and the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis, for 20 years. This body of work shows the risks that come with behaviour like South Africa’s. The country could find itself in the middle of a tense situation.
South Africa needs to pull off an exceptional balancing act in managing its international relations in a sensible way that protects and advances its economic interests.
Note that the geopolitical tensions between China and the US are not just about trade disputes. They also include espionage, China’s Belt and Road Initiative, climate change and environmental issues, and tensions over Hong Kong, Taiwan and South China Sea disputes.
As a major source of infrastructure financing to sub-Saharan Africa, China is now the region’s largest bilateral official lender. Its total sub-Saharan African external public debt – what these governments owe to China – rose from less than 2% before 2005 to over 17% in 2021.
Agoa might present a challenge to China as competition for its own interests in Africa. China would like African countries to untie or loosen their agreements with the US. It is thus a good moment to take stock of the actual benefits South Africa has derived from the Agoa agreement with the US.
What Agoa is about
The Agoa agreement was approved as legislation by the US Congress in May 2000 for an initial 15 years. On 29 June 2015 it was extended and signed into law by then president Barack Obama for a further 10 years to 2025.
It will come into review again in 2024, hence the importance of the upcoming summit. Recently, Louisiana senator John Kennedy introduced a bill to the US Congress to extend Agoa by a further 20 years to 2045. This is a bid to counter China’s growing influence in Africa, and to continue to allow sub-Saharan African countries preferential access to US markets.
Agoa’s benefits to South Africa
In 2021, the US was the second most significant destination for South Africa’s exports worldwide, mainly thanks to Agoa. China took the top spot; Germany was third. The US ranked third as a source of South Africa’s imports, following China and Germany. In that year, the total trade volume between South Africa and the US reached its zenith at $24.5 billion, with a trade imbalance of $9.3 billion in South Africa’s favour.
Agoa offers preferential entry for about 20% of South Africa’s exports to the US, or 2% of South Africa’s global exports. The stock of South African investment in the US has more than doubled since 2011, amounting to US$3.5 billion in 2020. American foreign direct investment (FDI) in South Africa increased by over 70% over that period, to US$10 billion. This made the US South Africa’s fifth largest source of FDI in 2019. The US was its third largest destination for outward FDI.
US investment in South Africa is mainly concentrated in manufacturing, finance and insurance, and wholesale trade, which is vital for economic growth. American multinationals doing business in South Africa employ about 148,000 people.
More specifically, Agoa’s benefits include:
duty-free and quota-free access to the US market for a wide range of South African products. This benefits South Africa’s textile and apparel industry in particular. To sub-Saharan African countries, Agoa provides duty-free access to the US market for over 1,800 products. This is in addition to the more than 5,000 products that are eligible for duty-free access under the US Generalised System of Preferences programme
export diversification, especially of items such as agricultural products, textiles, and manufactured goods. This is vital for increasing export earnings, which help to improve South Africa’s balance of payments, particularly its trade account.
capacity building through technical assistance and programmes to help South African businesses meet US standards, thus becoming more competitive in the global marketplace.
economic development and poverty reduction, which aligns with South Africa’s developmental goals.
Balancing economic interests
China is the largest consumer of South African commodity exports, and thus a key influencer of the rand exchange rate. In addition, China and Russia’s planned move towards de-dollarisation (trying to replace the petrodollar system with their own system) puts American interests under threat. This means South Africa needs to carefully navigate its relations with the US and its Brics partners, China and Russia.
It will want to keep strong ties with the US through Agoa without getting into a difficult position between China and the US. The outcome of the November meeting will have serious economic implications.",Agoa trade deal talks: South Africa will need to carefully manage relations with the US and China,politics
"China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which now includes 44 African countries, got under way 10 years ago. President Xi Jinping launched it in 2013 with a first speech in Kazakhstan and a second one in Indonesia. The initiative is something of a trial-by-doing development policy enigma: it keeps China watchers chasing Xi’s next move to help define just what it is.
The two speeches, however, give some lasting guidance. The Kazakhstan speech outlined five elements of the “Belt”: strengthening policy communication; road connectivity; currency circulation; people-to-people ties; and promoting unimpeded trade. In Indonesia, the five points were more abstract and diplomacy-oriented. They were framed as pursuing win-win cooperation, mutual assistance and affinity, and remaining open and inclusive.
So, what’s happened since then? As an economist with a keen interest in the political economy of China-Africa relations, I have studied the Belt and Road Initiative since its inception.
Among the more tangible achievements so far is fostering “road connectivity”. China has helped to finance and construct highways, rail and energy projects in various countries. People, goods and commodities flow more smoothly in many places than before, within and between countries. But at a cost. Most of these projects have been funded by loans from Chinese banks, including the China Export Import Bank and China Development Bank.
Marking the 10th anniversary at a forum in October, Xi outlined the progress of the initiative. He also made a commitment to raise the quality of development cooperation, and provided more details on people-to-people ties and on areas of policy dialogue especially.
Much is made of a fall in spending on the Belt and Road Initiative. But if these promises take shape, the early big spending years may come to reflect a down payment. That down payment was made in times of low interest rates and kick-started some important and highly visible infrastructural projects.
Xi’s announcement at this year’s forum offered old and new news for the Belt and Road Initiative and its signatories. For African signatories (and their regional organisations and development banks) to make the most of what China is now offering, they need to understand the origins of the Belt and Road Initiative and also what has and has not changed since.
In addition, Xi’s announcement comes at a time when China’s relationship with the African continent is changing, as I outlined in a recent article. The change sees the China-Africa relationship move beyond a focus on oil, extractive commodities and large infrastructure projects. It shifts attention to industrial production, job creation and investments that lead to African exports, and productivity-enhancing agricultural and digital technology opportunities. This model, called the “Hunan model”, is named after the province in southern China that is leading the push. This also helps to explain why China’s lending is moving from bilateral development finance to include more commercial and trade finance lending.
Comparing promises 10 years on
Xi made eight major commitments at the October 2023 forum. More than half of these draw directly from the policy focus areas announced a decade ago.
Xi promised to build a multidimensional Belt and Road connectivity. He referred to roads, rail, port and air transport and related logistics and trade corridors.
He promised to open China’s economy more to the world. Higher trade levels would be one way. Alongside a new emphasis on the digital economy, Xi added that China would establish pilot zones for e-commerce-based cooperation. In Africa, a guide to those may be provided by the two existing digital commerce hubs set up by Alibaba in Ethiopia and Rwanda under its electronic World Trade Platform Initiative.
He spoke of “practical cooperation”. This seems to refer to financing for expensive infrastructure projects, smaller livelihood projects and technical and vocational training. This has an aspect of crossover with currency circulation, people-to-people ties, unimpeded trade and more.
Xi’s recent speech also promised to support people-to-people exchanges. This is a direct take from the first launch speech of 2013. But he added detail about establishing arts and culture alliances. Also that China would host a “Liangzhu Forum” to enhance dialogue on civilisation.
Finally, in line with the earlier commitment to elevated policy dialogue, Xi promised to strengthen institutional building for international Belt and Road Initiative cooperation. This relates to building platforms for cooperation in energy, taxation, finance, green development, disaster reduction, anti-corruption, think-tanks, media, culture, and other fields.
Where extending sovereign lending may present a challenge at the moment while the legacy of debt sustainability issues is addressed, Chinese policy banks are continuing to lend to institutions of the global south. For example, in the lead up to the forum the China Development Bank agreed a US$400mn loan to Afreximbank to support small and medium enterprise trade efforts, with an eye on the goal of “unimpeded trade” and Africa’s own regional integration efforts under the African Continental Free Trade Area.
Beyond the promises made in Xi’s speech to this year’s forum, elevated funding for China’s policy banks was announced. Further, agreements made between participants also signal commitment to the original principles of the Belt and Road Initiative. For example, Xi’s speech in Kazakhstan in 2013 called for elevated currency circulation. China has not only developed its mobile payments ecosystem, but is now testing its emerging central bank digital currency, the eCNY, at home and abroad.
New promises
There are three new policy promises added to those of a decade ago.
China will promote green development, including green infrastructure, green energy, and green transportation. It will hold a Belt and Road Initiative Green Innovation Conference and establish a network of experts. China also promised to provide 100,000 training opportunities in areas of green development.
China will continue to advance scientific and technological innovation. It will hold a conference on Science and Technology Exchange, and increase the number of joint laboratories that support exchange and training for young scientists. Xi also promised that China would propose a Global Initiative for Artificial Intelligence Governance, and promote secure artificial intelligence development.
China will promote integrity-based cooperation. This would include publishing details of Belt and Road achievements and prospects, and establishing a system of evaluating compliance.
These new areas are of increasing economic importance to China, amid rapid population ageing especially, and competition with high-income countries.
The future
Where the twin launch speeches of the Belt and Road Initiative had very broad agendas, Xi’s speech at the 10-year anniversary revealed progress on earlier themes and a push to elevate the quality of development. There was more detail especially on people-to-people ties and on areas of policy dialogue to be fostered.
He added some new areas such as artificial intelligence governance, green development, e-commerce, and greater emphasis on scientific and tech cooperation. These new areas are becoming more economically important to China.
Comparing the new policy signals with the earlier ones implies that the initiative is by design adaptable. Further, since the COVID pandemic, some countries that had benefited from China’s new level of Belt and Road lending have run into debt problems and interest rates have risen. This signals China’s increased interest in lending to regional and locally present multilateral development and commercial banks that are relatively well positioned to target local entrepreneurs and development. In Africa, this offers a new chance to evolve strategies that can sustainably tap Chinese resources towards fostering the independent advance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement and local socioeconomic development.","China’s Belt and Road Initiative turns 10: Xi announces 8 new priorities, continues push for global influence",politics
"An outbreak of avian flu – a highly contagious viral infection that affects wild birds as well as poultry – has hit poultry farms in South Africa. Two different strains are causing outbreaks in the country – A(H5N1) and influenza A(H7N6). A specialist in poultry health, Shahn Bisschop, answers some questions put to him by The Conversation Africa.
What strain has broken out in South Africa?
The outbreak caused by a highly pathogenic (HPAI) strain of H7N6 avian influenza is causing the most concern at present. The strain was first confirmed in chickens near Delmas north of Johannesburg at the beginning of June 2023.
This virus is a novel mutation of a strain which originated from wild birds at or near the location of the original outbreak.
The strain is well-adapted to chickens – it infects them easily and replicates effectively in them, in preference to other avian species – and spreads very easily between birds and farms. An estimated 10 million have become infected while 6 million died from the H7N6. A further 1.7 million died from H5N1 earlier in the year.
The conventional control measures (collectively known as biosecurity) have been less effective than usual in limiting the spread of the disease. The main measures taken on poultry farms include strictly limiting human and vehicle movement. People entering farms will typically take further measures to limit disease transmission such as showering, changing clothes and disinfecting footwear when moving between different parts of the farm.
Because wild birds are associated with the spread of avian flu, measures are taken to ensure they are completely excluded from all chicken sheds.
What’s new this time?
For at least the past nine years, HPAI H5 viruses of the 2.3.4.4 clade have been spread across the globe principally by wild bird migrations and infect a range of avian and mammalian species. The first recorded cases caused by viruses belonging to this clade were reported in South Africa in 2017. A second outbreak occurred in 2020. It was anticipated that the next outbreak would probably also be caused by these viruses and indeed the first reported cases of HPAI in 2023 in the coastal regions were associated with H5 strains.
Local experts are working on the theory that the present outbreak of H7N6 HPAI was created when a low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) virus circulating without causing disease in wild birds underwent a mutation to become an HPAI strain adapted to causing serious disease in chickens. This mutation occurred locally.
Mutation from LPAI to HPAI has been described in poultry in various parts of the world but was considered less likely than the return of the H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses previously encountered.
What’s in place and what’s missing
Avian influenza is a “controlled disease”. That means it’s placed under strict government control with the aim of eradication as quickly as possible when outbreaks are detected. All outbreaks on farms are immediately reported to the state veterinary service, which takes responsibility for the disease.
The protocol for HPAI control is that all affected farms are placed under strict quarantine and all surviving birds are destroyed and disposed of as quickly as possible in order to limit the further spread of the disease.
But there are weaknesses in the system.
The biggest is that the state veterinary services don’t have sufficient resources to manage the outbreaks effectively.
Secondly, because the state doesn’t compensate farmers for their losses, they have difficulty getting farmers to comply with orders to cull. This has meant that outbreaks have spread out of control. Infected birds have been moved off infected farms for sale – taking the disease with them.
Farmers in the EU and US are compensated when culling happens. This used to be the case in South Africa but no longer happens.
As a result, South Africa has struggled to contain HPAI outbreaks. In 2017 and 2020/21 the outbreaks gradually slowed and eventually stopped.
HPAI outbreaks tend to be seasonal. In Europe, they occur principally in winter months. In South Africa, there is a similar but less clear trend to more cases in the winter and fewer in summer. This may be related to reduced viral survival in hotter summer weather.
Are there new approaches to consider?
New and innovative thinking is needed to deal with the reality on the ground in South Africa.
One possible solution is the introduction of appropriate vaccines. This would reduce the losses associated with outbreaks and would slow the spread of the disease between farms. Like all vaccines, they can’t prevent birds from becoming infected but they can manage the level of infection and spread. But they can’t eradicate the disease.
But there are limited options in terms of available vaccines. And South Africa would need to ensure that the vaccines registered for use in the country were effective against the local strain. If vaccines are poorly matched to outbreak strains, they won’t be effective.
All of this will take time, even with the best effort of government and industry.
Does the strain pose a risk to people? What should consumers should be aware of?
The South African Poultry Association has made it clear that poultry products are safe for consumption. It has been collaborating with the University of Pretoria to make sure poultry products are indeed safe. Together with leading scientists they have sequenced the current field strain of H7 avian influenza virus. In a recent paper  scientists reported that none of the amino acid markers were present that afford the virus the ability to bind to mammalian cells.
This shows that infection of humans with the current virus is highly unlikely.",Bird flu in South Africa: expert explains what’s behind the chicken crisis and what must be done about it,environment + energy
"Every day seems to bring new headlines about rising costs. In Nigeria, unions are threatening to strike amid soaring fuel prices; the country’s inflation rate hit 25% in August. The amount it costs to fill a food basket in South Africa keeps climbing. Ghanaians took to the streets of Accra in late September to protest about the cost of living.
A recent study by the audit and consulting firm Deloitte found that 75% of South Africans were concerned that the prices for everyday purchases would continue to increase, while 80% of consumers across all income groups expected the prices of groceries, household utilities and fuel to rise.
This stark reality means budgeting may be more necessary than ever.
If you don’t know how to create a budget, then you shouldn’t feel bad – most adults aren’t taught how to create one. And most people don’t budget, because they see it as restrictive or unsustainable. But it need not be: once you appreciate that a budget can work for you, it can be a financially empowering exercise. It’s a cornerstone of financial planning because it ensures you are living within your means and helps you remain in financial control.
As a financial planning academic, I focus in my research on improving financial wellbeing and promoting savings behaviours through interventions such as budgeting. Here are five guidelines for creating a budget.
1. Apps vs spreadsheet
A good place to start is to choose the format of how you’re going to budget. There are several online templates and apps you can use for budgeting. For instance, 22Seven has gained popularity in South Africa due to its compatibility with several financial institutions, including the country’s big five banks. Similarly, Mint is a popular budgeting tool that is used in Kenya and Nigeria.
Read more: Are you financially literate? Here are 7 signs you're on the right track
If you prefer to put pen to paper, some online templates come with free printable budgets. Creating your own Excel spreadsheet is an equally good approach.
What matters most is using a tool that you can commit to.
2. Itemising your income and expenses
A budget essentially shows how much you’re spending in relation to how much you’re earning. So once you have selected your budgeting tool, you need to fill in your income and itemise how much you’re spending on each expense in a month. A budget can be considered a cashflow statement because it allows you to track money coming in (income) and money going out (expenses).
If you are living within your means, your budget should indicate a surplus – more cash inflows than cash outflows. So budgeting provides an accurate account of your short-term financial position.
3. A realistic account of expenses
When you look at your financial statements, fill your expenses into your budget honestly and accurately. Don’t cheat! Since everyone’s financial situation is different, your budget will also be unique.
Even though there is no one-size-fits-all approach to budgeting, it should still consider all of your expenses (both regular and intermittent). A general rule of thumb is that if it’s deducted from your account then you should treat it as an expense. This includes payments for housing, medical insurance, fuel, dining out, credit card repayments and even bank fees.
4. Save first, spend later
Now you’ve seen how much you’re spending. Either it’s too much – and you can plan where to cut back – or you have savings at the end of the month.
When compiling your budget it’s important to demarcate how much will be in the form of savings. What’s more important is getting into the habit of saving before you spend instead of saving after spending. If you spend first then you’ve deprived yourself of the opportunity to save for a rainy day.
Furthermore, research has shown that getting into the habit of saving has a transgenerational effect: it can be considered a cultural value that is passed on from one generation to another. So think of saving as paying yourself first. Once you have done so, you won’t feel guilty for treating yourself because you’ve already done the financially responsible thing by putting your savings aside.

5. Considering assets and liabilities
Once you’ve become comfortable with consistently budgeting, you can take it up a notch by including your assets (everything you own with an economic value) and liabilities (everything you owe) to determine your overall financial position.
You can get a clearer picture of your overall financial wellbeing by compiling a list of all your assets, for example your savings and home equity, in relation to liabilities (such as bank loans). Knowing your long-term financial position can indicate how financially resilient or vulnerable you are. In the event of a financial emergency, you will know which resources you can draw upon to meet an unexpected expense.
By creating a budget (and sticking to it), you can protect yourself and your household from financial shocks. Consider the alternative. Imagine you haven’t budgeted and set savings aside. If a financial emergency were to arise, your next best bet would be to borrow the funds you need. You’d have to come up with a plan to repay what you’d borrowed while also building your savings.
A healthy habit
Getting into the habit of budgeting isn’t easy, especially if you haven’t done it before or you’re intimidated by the process. But, as the expression goes, “a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”. Think of budgeting as taking a small but important step towards reclaiming control over your finances and improving your financial well-being.",Battling to make ends meet?

"Inequality remains on the top of the policy priority list for most countries in the world. Branko Milanovic, a leading scholar on inequality, recently delivered a lecture titled “Recent changes in the global income distribution and their political implications” at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Imraan Valodia asked him to unpack some of the main points of his lecture.
Imraan Valodia: There is a lot of discussion across the world about rising income inequality. What your lecture makes clear is that the evidence is more nuanced. Income inequality between countries has actually been falling since the 2000s, but income inequality within countries is rising. Can you elaborate on this, and outline the main factors driving these patterns of income inequality, both between and within countries?
Branko Milanovic: Yes, your summary is correct. Global inequality is the sum of inequality between countries, weighted by countries’ population, and inequality within countries. Since the 1990s, countries in Asia with relatively large populations, like China, India and Vietnam, have had high growth rates per capita – much higher than the developed countries. As a result of this, the population-weighted between-country inequality has been falling.
On the other hand, inequalities within countries have been getting much worse. These are now higher than they were 30 years ago in all major countries: the US, China, Russia, most of continental Europe, even South Africa. Only Latin America, which already was very unequal, has not followed this trend of increase of within-national inequalities.
Most of the time people don’t distinguish between these different inequalities which, as I said, have moved differently. And that creates confusion.
Imraan Valodia: You have highlighted the importance of understanding historical trends in income inequality, and how political factors shape inequality outcomes over time. What are these major historical trends, and why is it important to understand them?
Branko Milanovic: I think that the main historical trends are always reflected in income distributions or inequalities, whether we are talking of inequalities within countries or more broadly, at the global level.
At the global level, I identify three major eras.
The time of colonialism and sharp class conflict within countries during most of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. During that time both between-country and within-country inequalities increased. One can view between-country inequality in this case as something that made colonialism possible, or a reflection of colonialism. Both as a cause and effect.
Then during the second half of the 20th century, global inequality was extremely high and the world was divided into three “worlds”: the First (rich countries), the Second (socialist counties), and the Third (Asia, Africa and Latin America).
That changed with the rise of China, and Asia more broadly (the third era). Global inequality was reduced, but at the “cost” of rising within-national inequalities. What I mean is that globalisation might have strongly helped the growth of Asian countries, but also contributed to the increase of within-national inequalities. This is our current era. But it too might come to an end.
Imraan Valodia: Your research shows that, across the world, since the global financial crisis in 2008, the share of global income accruing to the wealthiest has not been rising. This is a change from the period before the financial crisis, as shown in your famous elephant curve, when the share of the top earners did increase sharply. But you make the point that in recent years, in money terms, the wealthiest are still increasing their incomes rapidly. Can you elaborate and explain what the difference between the relative and absolute trends means, and why it’s significant?
Branko Milanovic: Since the global financial crisis, income of the global top 1% has not returned to the growth rates they enjoyed before the crisis. This can be intuitively best understood through the example of the US, which contributes to almost one-half of the people in the global top 1%. Incomes at the very top of the US pyramid dropped during the crisis, slowly began to recover in the period after 2010, but reached their pre-crisis level only in 2018.
This means that the average growth rate over these ten years was close to zero. The second highest US percentile recovered to the pre-crisis level a bit earlier, by 2015, but the decennial average growth rate was only 1.5%. This is much below the growth rates of the top before the financial crisis.
These are relative numbers. In absolute terms, however, these very small percentage increases did translate into large absolute gains simply because the gaps in the initial-period income distribution are huge. If your income is US$1 million, even a 1% increase will mean $10,000, which is somebody else’s total annual income.
Imraan Valodia: You make the point that with the current slowdown in economic growth in China, the future pattern of global income inequality may be shaped by income trends in Africa. Why is Africa important for the future trajectory of income across the globe, and why are you pessimistic about the potential for Africa to emulate the trends that we have seen in recent years in China and India?
Branko Milanovic: China is no longer the engine of global inequality reduction that it was in the past simply because it is no longer a poor, but rather an upper-middle income country.
If global inequality is to continue on its downward trend we need new “Chinas”. One of them is obviously India, which is currently the most populous country in the world. If India continues to grow, we can expect global inequality to continue to fall.
But the others are populous African countries. This is why African economic growth is central to what happens in this century to both global poverty and global inequality.
I am pessimistic on whether African countries would be able to replicate China and India, simply based on the past: very few African countries were able to maintain high economic growth rates for a relatively long time (say, at least five or ten years in a row).
But it is an observation based on the past. We may be wrong in extrapolating it to the future.
Still the key issue of the importance of African economic growth remains. Without it, global inequality will not be reduced, and might easily increase – which would bring us to the fourth global era (to allude to my answer in the beginning of our conversation).",Inequality: troubling trends and why economic growth in Africa is key to reducing global disparities,home page
"A common sight around west Africa is to see cattle grazing freely, even in major cities, on highways and in airports.
Every year, about 300 million head of livestock (mostly cattle) move across west Africa. Based on seasonal factors, they leave their usual grazing areas in search of water and pasture.
These practices, called pastoralism, or transhumance, go back millennia. They helped maximise land use in dry regions.
In a bid to support these practices, the Economic Community of West African State (Ecowas) drew up regulations in 1998 and 2003. All Ecowas member states were to apply the regulations.
As an expert in food and agricultural law, natural resources development and international trade, I examined the regulations to see what effects they might be having on investments in the livestock sector.
My findings show that livestock productivity has not improved in the region since the introduction of the new rules. Cattle productivity has fallen and milk production has improved very minimally. Clashes between farmers and herders have increased, along with insecurity. Elites take advantage of the regulations to exploit poor herders.
I conclude that the regulations may be discouraging meaningful large-scale investments such as ranching that could increase productivity, create jobs and ensure peace in the region.
Movement of livestock across west Africa
Ecowas is the only regional economic community in Africa with specific regulations governing transhumance. The regional body is made up of 15 states.
Its regulations aim to improve livestock productivity and food security, enhance the environment and reduce poverty.
The regulations allow free movement of livestock across the borders of member states under certain conditions. For example, herders must possess the Ecowas International Transhumance Certificate, and a minimum of two herders must accompany the herds. The herders must be at least 18 years old.
Member states are obligated to apply the regulations. But they’re not doing so uniformly. Some coastal states don’t allow the herders into their countries. For instance, Benin Republic recently banned the entry of foreign herders into its territory. Togo and Côte d’Ivoire control the number of herders that enter their territories annually.
For its part, Nigeria is moving towards more sedentary cattle farming. Several states in Nigeria, such as Benue and Oyo, have also banned pastoralism.
These countries have restricted the movement of herds because of negative experiences such as farmer-herder clashes, cattle rustling and other forms of criminality.
Impact of Ecowas transhumance regulations
In my paper, I argue that Ecowas regulation allows transhumance to exist in a form that is inimical to other business investment options – like ranching – for livestock production in the region.
Investors want profit, safe environments and certainty in rules. Pastoralism, on the other hand, encourages cheap labour and other practices that put large-scale investment in livestock at risk.
Bad business environment
Transhumance has been commercialised – and criminalised – in ways that produce a negative environment for the livestock business.
Movement of herds has contributed to conflicts between farmers and pastoralists, gender-based violence, insecurity and other forms of criminality.
Traffickers, smugglers, bandits and drug peddlers capitalise on livestock movement to commit crimes.
Proliferation of arms, terrorism, kidnapping and drug use have also increased in the guise of transhumance.
In Nigeria, for instance, it has been alleged that Boko Haram insurgents disguise themselves as pastoralists to convey improvised explosive devices to attack communities.
Limits modern methods
I also argue that the Ecowas regulations, by allowing herds to move around the region, discourage investment in modern methods of livestock production. This is because the cost of production in transhumance is low. Land and fodder are free. Labour is cheap and exploitative. All this makes other business models, such as ranching, relatively unattractive by comparison. It affects their profits and investment risks.
Some countries which practise pastoralism, such as Mongolia and Tibet, restrict it to arid regions.
What should be done
In my view, the practice of transhumance in west Africa should be gradually phased out. By this I mean a gradual – and then finally a total – ban on herder movements across borders.
This is because it is not an efficient use of land. About a third of west Africa’s land area is used for agriculture. Two-thirds of this serves as rangeland and pastures while one-third is used for crop production. Designated rangelands should be established in semi-arid areas of the region. Pastoralism should be restricted to these rangelands.
In my view conflict will be reduced if transhumance is restricted to arid and semi-arid regions. This in turn will make ranching more attractive, making room for large-scale investments that could create jobs and improve food security.
In the immediate future focus should be given to:
the strict implementation of the International Transhumance Certificate. The certificate usually contains particulars on the composition of the herd, the vaccinations given, the itinerary of the herds, and the destination of the pastoralist. The responsibility of issuing the certificate rests on the country of origin. This should reduce incidences of criminal elements disguised as herders.
limiting the number of cattle that people can have in a moving herd. This will help avoid herds straying, and resultant conflicts.
introducing new rules requiring the use of ear-tags. This would help with traceability when cattle are stolen or when they destroy farmlands.",Ecowas rules to protect pastoralists discourage investments in modern livestock farming,business + economy
"The annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are due to take place in Marrakech, Morocco, in mid-October. The city and country are still reeling from a devastating earthquake in early September.
Hosting these meetings on the African continent for the first time in half a century under such circumstances carries immense symbolism, serving as a demonstration of resilience.
The two institutions are increasingly facing questions about their relevance in addressing current global challenges. One of their responses has been to commit to playing a more prominent role in the global climate response.
The call for reform of the IMF and World Bank is particularly urgent for Africa, where countries require increased access to public and private financing and debt relief. A transformed financial system is essential to support sustained growth that benefits everyone, and that bolsters climate resilience.
Unfortunately, many sources of finance, including those from the World Bank and IMF, don’t adequately cater for African nations’ specific needs.
To be effective, financial support for Africa must have several qualities: affordability, dependability, adequacy and sensitivity to the continent’s climate vulnerability. It must also be adaptable to address the persistent debt crises and liquidity challenges facing numerous African countries.
Several policy proposals have been put forward, some from African countries themselves. Some are set out in a recent report which I was involved with by the African Climate Foundation on reforming the global financial architecture.
The African Consultative Group and the African Caucus within the IMF and World Bank are voicing significant expectations about the outcomes from Marrakech. This reflects cautious optimism among Africans, grown weary of unfulfilled promises over the years.
The decisions made in Marrakech will be a litmus test of the willingness of the IMF and World Bank to reform.
Africa is unfairly treated
The African continent boasts promising opportunities for clean energy and is rich in mineral resources essential for the ecological transition. Yet funding often bypasses it, or focuses on exports rather than local economic transformation.
Imposing a uniform policy approach on African countries has only worsened crises, limiting their policy space. For instance, Africa is meant to go through lengthy and strict processes to justify why it needs resources to support certain green projects. This adherence to specific orthodox macroeconomic principles is less strict when applied to wealthier countries. But it’s inflexible for vulnerable African countries.
The African Climate Foundation’s recent report identified numerous flaws in funding, as well as the reasons why Africa suffers more than most to access liquidity. We found that:
Much of the financing is directed towards mitigation efforts, such as increasing area of forests. There’s little attention to adaptation, which is a priority for the continent. Mitigation tends to be more profitable for financiers and lenders.
Rating agencies’ behaviour has elevated interest rates for African countries. This has forced most countries to substantiate their funding needs beyond reason, despite having the lowest default rates on infrastructure project debt worldwide.
Flows are being hindered by restrictive terms, commercialisation of climate finance, high interest rates, unmet climate finance commitments, unethical and speculative carbon markets, declining overseas development assistance and labelling of the same money as “climate finance”.
The reform agenda
African countries have been actively engaged in the reform agenda. For example, the declaration from the African Climate Summit in Nairobi set out to reshape the approach to climate investment on the continent and consolidate a unified African stance on climate finance on the road to COP28.
Several other proposals are also under consideration. These include:
a comprehensive overhaul of the IMF’s quota system, with the potential inclusion of a third chair dedicated to Africa. IMF quotas reflects a country’s relative size in the global economy. They are used to determine the fund’s financial and governance structure.
a revaluation of the use of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). SDRs are used by IMF member countries as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Given Africa’s marginal share, stakeholders are demanding that the IMF reallocate US$100 billion to ease liquidity pressures post COVID-19.
a critical examination of the current debt framework, which doesn’t align the goal of adapting to climate change with sustainable development.
The IMF could take additional steps. These include:
helping address debt by suspending surcharges. IMF surcharges are fees meant to discourage prolonged use of IMF funds. But this places an unfair burden on poor countries in need of resources.
streamlining access to new climate funds
ensuring that low-income funds such as the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust have sufficient resources for lending.
A sovereign debtors club – or similar partnerships – among debtor countries could also prove beneficial. Such a club helps to increase the bargaining position to get low-interest loans.
Meanwhile, the World Bank faces its own set of challenges. The bank should focus on providing cheaper financing and making more funds available as part of its quest to integrate sustainability, resilience and inclusivity in the Evolution Roadmap.
It should also reevaluate its operating model, making it easier for African countries to access funds and giving them more say in fund allocation. The bank should explore innovative approaches to financial support and develop new financial instruments tailored to the real-time needs of borrowers, for instance, supporting smart agriculture.
The African Climate Foundation’s report shows that the global financial architecture diminishes Africa’s fiscal sovereignty and ability to pay for climate action itself.
In addition, the international tax system perpetuates historical power imbalances. It favours wealthy nations’ commercial interests and pushes Africa to the margins. Implementing more robust and transparent financial regulations is essential to increase the number of participants and instruments in the financial market. But this should be done through better rules that promote a variety of financial services and lower their cost.
Global legislation to safeguard the tax bases of African economies from tax incentives and legal loopholes used by multinational corporations could combat the outflow of capital from Africa through the international banking system.
On top of this the challenge of illicit financial flows has to be rethought as the responsibility of countries receiving such funds has been overlooked.","Cautious welcome: World Bank and IMF return to Africa, but questions remain",business + economy
"The global price of cocoa is spiking, a direct response to dwindling cocoa output in west Africa. In September, cocoa futures reached a 44-year price peak due to mounting concerns over reduced supplies from the region.
The price surge could prove to be a critical moment for cocoa farming and policy in west Africa.
The cocoa-producing belt of west Africa is responsible for generating over 80% of the total global output. Between them, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire contribute more than 60% to the global output. Ghana is the second-biggest producer in the world and cocoa is a vital component of the country’s economy.
The global price spike has led west African governments to increase the guaranteed producer prices to farmers. Ghana recently raised the state-guaranteed cocoa price paid to farmers by two thirds. The announcement means that Ghana’s cocoa farmers will be paid 20,943 cedis (US$1,837) per tonne for the upcoming 2023-2024 season, up from 12,800 cedis.
Cameroon, the world’s fourth-largest cocoa producer, raised the price cocoa farmers get to 1,500 CFA francs (US$2.50) per kilogram, a 25% jump from the previous rate of 1,200 CFA francs. This increase is even more significant than Ghana’s when factoring in Cameroon’s single-digit inflation. Additionally, the Cote d'Ivoire government has announced a rise in the producer price.
As an economics researcher who has extensively studied and written about cocoa production in west Africa, I contend that the recent shortages can be harnessed to strengthen the position of cocoa producers. This will enable them to address the structural challenges ingrained in the cocoa production value chain. Rising production costs have not been recognised in the value of cocoa beans. Farmers therefore haven’t been able to earn enough income and this has led to unsustainable farming practices.
In my view, west African countries should use the cocoa shortage as negotiating leverage against multinational corporations to address these structural issues. Both Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire must recognise this pivotal moment. They must take the lead, and frame the current production challenges as deep-seated structural problems requiring solutions, rather than as short-term issues.
What’s driving the change?
Ghana’s cocoa regulator recently indicated that its farmers might not be able to meet some cocoa contract obligations for another season. Ghana’s projected cocoa yield for the 2022/23 planting season was the lowest in 13 years, falling 24% short of the initial estimates of 850,000 metric tonnes.
This trend has been repeated across the region, with production falling in Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon.
Reduced output means demand can’t be met and global prices rise.
The reduction in cocoa output is attributed to short-term and long-term factors.
Commentators typically emphasise the short-term factors:
poor weather conditions
black pod disease, which causes cocoa pods to rot
the decline in the number of cocoa farmers, some of them selling their land to illegal miners
a shortage of fertilisers and pesticides, especially since the conflict in Ukraine has curtailed Russia’s export of potash and other fertilisers.
A number of long-term structural issues have beset cocoa farming in west Africa for decades. They shouldn’t be overshadowed by concerns with short-term problems.
The first is the declining availability of forest land and its connection to increasing production costs.
Over the last two decades, depletion of forest land has led farmers to turn to grasslands for replanting cocoa plants. This requires extensive land preparation, regular weeding around the cocoa trees, pruning, and the application of fertilisers and pesticides. What’s more, the plants are highly susceptible to disease. All these things result in increased labour costs.
None of these additional burdens have been incorporated into the pricing for sustainable cocoa production. In light of the new cost structure, cocoa beans have been undervalued for decades. Farmers have become poorer and are exploring alternative sources of livelihood.
The cost of sustainably cultivating cocoa in grasslands must be reflected in the price that farmers receive. Relying solely on market forces will not achieve this. For instance, every year, typically in September, the Ghana Cocoa Board announces the official producer price for cocoa beans for the upcoming cocoa season on behalf of the government. This official price is based on the anticipated export market price, with an understanding in Ghana that farmers should receive approximately 70% of it. However, the resulting market price, and consequently the producer price derived from it, often falls short of covering the costs of sustainable cocoa cultivation.
A path forward
What would it cost for cocoa farmers to cultivate cocoa beans sustainably, and ensure a living income, without contributing to deforestation or resorting to child labour?
If the market price falls below this cost (which isn’t static), then the farmers face exploitation, giving rise to many of the problems that plague the industry.
A few years ago, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire pioneered the introduction of the “living income differential” – a premium that cocoa buyers would pay on top of the market price to ensure that farmers earned a sustainable income from their produce. Despite its noble intent, the initiative faltered. It was not well thought through. And it came at a time when these countries had diminished bargaining clout in a saturated market. Now is a favourable moment.
The crisis in the sector puts cocoa producers in a stronger negotiating position.
Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire could collaborate with other regional countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, to negotiate a better position for their cocoa farmers, ensuring sustainable cultivation. There are many strategies these countries can explore, including supply management (such as buffer stocks, export controls, or quotas), price premiums and value addition.",Cocoa prices are surging: west African countries should seize the moment to negotiate a better deal for farmers,business + economy
"From US car factories to public sector workers in Nigeria and South Africa, strikes by trade unions continue unabated among the established sectors of the working class. In Detroit in the US, workers are resisting contract employment. In Nigeria they are angry over the rising cost of living and in South Africa, municipal workers are striking for better wages.
But it’s becoming increasingly difficult to build sustainable worker organisations as companies employ more people on a casual basis in the digital age. Work has become more precarious and workers are easily replaceable.
In our new book, Recasting Workers’ Power: Work and Inequality in the Shadow of the Digital Age, we focus on workers’ power. The classic example of workers’ power is the strike: the collective withdrawal of labour to force an employer to do what they would otherwise not have done.
In this book we challenge the dominant narrative that new technology has destroyed workers’ power. We focus on the new jobs that are being created – food couriers, e-hailing drivers, street traders and the growing numbers of casual workers at the core of the economy.
Read more: Zambia's copper mines hard-baked racism into the workplace by labelling whites 'expats'
We show how these precarious workers are organising in new ways that go beyond the traditional methods of union formation. For example, they are forming coalitions with other organisations, such as NGOs. In some cases they are combining these new approaches with traditional ways of bringing workers’ collective power to bear, for example by making use of laws that support workers’ rights.
Three case studies
We focus on three sectors: factory workers in Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg in South Africa; food couriers in Johannesburg; and transport workers in Kampala, Uganda.
We examined their ways of organising by applying, in addition to the strike weapon, the lens of three other ways of exercising power: associational power (collective organisation), coalitions (societal power) and institutional power (laws that entrench labour rights).
We found the factory workers were using a range of tools – old and new – to organise. Factory committees were formed at some workplaces. This involved working with a labour supportive NGO. But they also drew on old practices (institutional power) by taking up cases through the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and the amended Labour Relations Act. Both offer the possibility of workers being able to get permanent jobs in the company at which they work.
The food carriers were using different tactics. In Johannesburg they had created worker-driven messaging apps and chat groups where they shared information, developed a shared identity and announced local direct action.
Being self-employed weakens their organising power. But the potential for collective power was increased when they met face-to-face at work zones and began to form a collective identity. Some have engaged in collective action, but with limited impact to date.
Read more: Has South Africa’s labour movement become a middle class movement?
They achieved some success when they worked with a supportive NGO (an international organisation) to put forward demands to regulate their work.
In Kampala, we found that the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers’ Union was also using new approaches to organise workers. In the 1980s the union faced a near collapse of membership when privatisation undermined the public transport sector. This eliminated the position of the traditional public transport bus driver. Informal mini-taxi drivers and motorcycle taxi riders (known locally as boda boda) became the dominant mode of transport.
By classifying the growing number of boda boda riders as workers and therefore potential union members, the union expanded from a declining 5,000 members to over 100,000. In spite of the fragmented and isolated nature of their work these new workers were already organised – not into a trade union but into informal associations.
These associations formed an alliance with the established union. By doing this they gained concrete support from the International Transport Federation, a global union of transport workers. This led to the dramatic growth of the union, a decline in police harassment and growing recognition as a collective bargaining partner.
Importantly, where trade unions have taken up the issues of informal workers, unions have also undergone fundamental changes. They often become “hybrid” organisations, blurring the distinction between traditional unionism, informal workers’ associations and cooperatives.
What next?
Our research clearly articulates the challenges workers face. But it also suggests some grounds for optimism in the new and hybrid forms of organisation and the coalitions that are emerging.
The question raised by these findings is whether these embryonic forms of worker organisation are sustainable. Could they become the foundations for a new cycle of worker solidarity and union growth?
Read more: Why formal employment is not a guaranteed path to social equality
We conclude that this is possible if they innovate and experiment with new forms of association, use digital tools, and broaden unions’ reach through coalition-building with other civil society organisations.

"The progress with South Africa’s land reform programme has not been properly monitored. This has resulted in an incorrect understanding of the real progress made to correct the racial distribution of farm land ownership in South Africa.
In 2012 the National Development Plan set a target to redistribute (or restore) 30% (or 23.7 million hectares) of all freehold agricultural land to black South Africans by 2030.
The general perception is that the land reform programme has failed to deliver a recognisable shift in ownership patterns. But the real situation is more nuanced. This is because land reform is made up of a number of initiatives. These include redistribution, restitution, financial compensation, private acquisition and state acquisition.
Some have progressed more than others. In this article I look at what’s happened to the state acquisition of farm land which is then, for the most part, leased to entrepreneurs wanting to become farmers. I identify the factors that stand in the way of its success. The list is drawn from reports as well as insights from farmers and based on my three decades of experience as an agricultural economist in the South African farming sector.
I have also identified steps that the government should take to fix the problems. These are informed partly by my view that the government should not be in the business of farming and should ideally simply be ensuring a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. The land should be in the hands and control of the entrepreneurs.
It is of the utmost importance that the government act on this ineffective and politics-ridden system of land leases and ensure that beneficiaries are getting secure rights to the land. If not, the question about why there are so few successful black commercial farmers (7% of all VAT registered farm businesses in South Africa will continue to be asked.
Land acquisition
In 1994 when South Africa held its first democratic elections, the 77.58 million ha of farmland in the country with registered tile deeds was mainly owned by white farmers.
Since then, by our calculations, the total area of land rights transferred away from white ownership – either to the state or black beneficiaries – or where financial compensation has been made, is equal to 19,165,891 ha. Our calculations will be published shortly by the Bureau for Economic Research in its update on the National Development Plan targets.
This is equivalent to 24.7% of all freehold agricultural land.
Although the number may look heartening, given that it is close to the 30% target set out in the National Development Plan, the issue of concern is that the state is now a major owner of agricultural land (more than 2.5 million hectares).
This is a problem for a number of reasons.
Flawed design
The Agricultural Land Holding Account Trading Entity is responsible for the acquisition of land and other property (movable and immovable), in terms of the Proactive Land Acquisition Scheme which was implemented in 2006. Through the scheme the land is then held by the state for the use by lessees of the programme.
By June 2023, the state had acquired 2.5 million hectares of productive farmland through the programme. Most of the roughly 2500 beneficiaries have a 30-year lease agreement with the state. There are several farms where no agreement has been signed.
The arrangement makes reference to the leasing of land. But there’s no mention of the transfer or sale of land to beneficiaries.
The acquisition strategy was a noble attempt at land reform. It had some clear objectives: acquire land of high agricultural potential; integrate black farmers into the commercial agricultural sector; improve beneficiary selection; improve land use planning; and ensure optimal productive land use.
But the programme has been disappointing. Virtually no land has been transferred to individuals. Most is leased to beneficiaries and in some cases the farms are illegally occupied. More than half of the current beneficiaries on the leased land have not shown any substantial agricultural production. This implies that valuable agricultural resources are not utilised and are lying fallow.
The factors behind this failure were set out in public in an article we recently co-authored. The article was based on findings which were first collated in a research report compiled by the Agricultural Research Council for the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform and released in 2019. However, its findings were never publicised.
Read more: The South African government has been buying farmland for black farmers. It's not gone well
I have gained further insights in conversations with farmers currently leasing land from the State. Their stories corroborate the report’s findings.
Major obstacles
Firstly, land tenure is insecure. This makes it difficult – or impossible – to invest in the land or secure loans for improvements and growth. Beneficiaries have to rely on government grants to do business. The grants are often not enough. And the process is often slow.
A second problem is bureaucratic red tape. There is clear evidence of excessive layers of approval with repetitive documentation. This causes significant delays.
Thirdly, there is a lack of access to finance. Farmers have limited credit history, collateral or access to formal financial institutions because of the nature of the lease arrangement.
Fourth, the arrangement of leasing of state land and the engagement of bureaucrats in the beneficiary selection process and management of decisions on the farms are setting beneficiaries up to fail.
Action that needs to be taken
Government has bought land on behalf of beneficiaries at market value. But the government doesn’t have the capacity and resources to manage the land assets and generate any return in the form of rents, improving the capital asset base or even performing general maintenance of the physical assets that may be on the land.
There are solutions.
Firstly, the government should transfer the asset to an institution with a vested interest and capacity to provide both oversight and finance. One such institution could be the Land Reform Agency announced by the president in his State of the Nation address of February 2021.
Secondly, beneficiaries who have managed to have commercially successful enterprises on these leased farms should get priority to acquire the land and finance.
Thirdly, lease amounts that are paid should get deducted from the purchase amount. And farmers who are up to date with their lease payments should be given preference.
Fourth, the purchase amount should be pegged at 50% of productive value (as opposed to the market value) – thus around 25% of initial purchase price by the state. Selling the farms at less than half the price they were bought for would allow farmers to grow quickly and avoid any challenges and give them the breathing space to catch up with their peers.
Fifth, the purchase price (pegged value minus lease amounts paid) should be financed over 25 years at a preferential interest rate.
Sixth, a financial institution (such as the Land Bank) should take title deeds as security and register a mortgage bond on the land.
Seventh, put a moratorium on the allowed window of reselling the farm to 10 years and let government have the first right of refusal.",South Africa’s government has been buying land and leasing it to black farmers. Why it’s gone wrong and how to fix it,business + economy
"Aziz Goolam Pahad, who has died at the age of 82, was a South African anti-apartheid activist, politician and deputy minister of foreign affairs in the post-1994 government.
Together with a small group of foreign policy analysts, I worked with Aziz over the span of 30 years, shaping the post-apartheid South African government’s approach to international relations and its foreign policy. We spent countless hours debating foreign affairs and the numerous crises and challenges government had to face as a relative “newcomer” in continental African and global affairs.
Aziz was generous with giving his time to formulate positions that would allow for the unlocking of a crisis. He remained open to intellectual challenges throughout his career. He was a keen participant in academic research projects dealing with foreign policy.
He made a monumental contribution to the struggle against apartheid and colonial oppression in South Africa, the continent and the Middle East. And he contributed significantly to the development and execution of a progressive African-centred foreign policy doctrine. Sadly, towards the end of his career as a diplomat he witnessed the slow decline of South Africa’s stature and influence in global affairs.
The Mandela and Mbeki years
Under presidents Nelson Mandela (1994-1999) and Thabo Mbeki (1999-2008), South African diplomats who’d sharpened their skills during many years of exile became sought-after as facilitators and mediators. Under their guidance Africa converted the Organisation of African Unity into the African Union, and reset relations with the international community via the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.
South African diplomats were articulate and visible in the corridors of the United Nations and in gatherings such as the Group of 7, Group of 20 and the Non-Aligned Movement. They were able to advance Africa’s quest for peace and development. In Africa, political and security crises, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and Burundi, were given attention.

However this “golden era” of South Africa’s foreign policy, as fellow scholar Chris Landsberg calls it, was unable to withstand the corroding effects of foreign meddling in African affairs. Neither could it withstand the grand corruption which reached its apogee in South Africa under former president Jacob Zuma (May 2009 - February 2018).
Preparatory years
Aziz was born on 25 December 1940 in the former Transvaal, the current North West province in South Africa. His parents were Amina and Goolam Pahad, activists in the Transvaal Indian Congress, a political organisation established in the early 1900s by Mahatma Gandhi and others. The congress became involved in the broader anti-apartheid struggle in later years. His elder brother, Essop, also became an activist. Essop passed away in July.
In 1963, Aziz completed a degree in sociology and Afrikaans at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. As an activist, he was served with a banning order and arrested on several occasions. After the Rivonia Trial from 1963 to 1964, in which ten leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) were tried for sabotage designed to overthrow the apartheid system of racial oppression, he and Essop left South Africa and went into exile.
Aziz spent some time in Angola and Zimbabwe but lived mostly in London. He completed a master’s degree in politics and international relations at the University of Sussex. He worked full-time for the exiled ANC and supported the development of the Anti-Apartheid Movement.
Even before his return to South Africa in 1990, he contributed to the transition from apartheid to democracy, a role well described in his book Insurgent Diplomat: Civil Talks or Civil War?.
Aziz worked closely with Thabo Mbeki, at the time head of the exiled ANC’s international relations department, and a small team of academics in formulating the ANC’s position on foreign policy. The paper formed part of preparations by the ANC and its alliance partners, the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, for governing the country.
Read more: South Africa's foreign policy: new paper sets the scene, but falls short on specifics
The foreign policy paper provided a broad roadmap for diplomats post-apartheid. It eventually shaped government’s more formal foreign policy of 2011, entitled Building a Better World: The Diplomacy of Ubuntu. In the mid-1990s, Aziz was instrumental in the establishment, with support from the German government, of an ANC-aligned think-tank called the Foundation of Global Dialogue, run by foreign policy expert and academic Garth le Pere and myself. It lives on as the Institute of Global Dialogue, based at the University of South Africa.
Role in government
Following the victory of the ANC in South Africa’s first democratic election in 1994, Aziz was elected to parliament. From there, he was appointed by President Mandela as deputy minister of foreign affairs. He was re-elected to parliament in 1999 and 2004, and kept his position as deputy minister of foreign affairs  throughout the Mandela and Mbeki presidencies.
Holding the post for 14 years meant that he was able to create and nurture a wide network of political, academic and diplomatic connections. This enabled him to play an unassuming but key mediating and facilitation role dealing with major crises on the continent and beyond.
But Aziz also showed his activist roots when he spoke out against the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Nato-led invasion of Libya and assassination of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. He supported the Palestinian struggle for recognition over many decades.
Aziz resigned from government and parliament in 2008, shortly after Mbeki was removed as president of the ANC in 2007.
The ‘diplomat-scholar’
In retirement, Aziz remained active as a “diplomat-scholar”. He played a prominent role, with his brother Essop, in a small but influential think-tank, the Concerned Africans Forum. In 2015 he headed the short-lived South African Council on International Relations.
The council was established by the government as a body of experts and a sounding board for senior decision-makers. However, its semi-autonomous identity brought it into conflict with the ruling party’s foreign affairs structures. Politicians allowed it to wither away.
In 2018 the administration of President Cyril Ramaphosa asked Aziz to lead a commission of experts to review South Africa’s international relations. In a sad repeat of the council’s demise, the commission was never given a proper hearing and its value remains untapped.
Read more: Why it's time South Africa's foreign policy was driven by ideas (again)
This is perhaps illustrative of the reality of policy-making in dynamic settings such as South Africa’s foreign affairs. The essence of Aziz’s contribution to a progressive African-oriented worldview was ultimately ignored by the foreign policy mandarins.

"Fresh efforts are being made to increase the share of black ownership in South Africa’s agricultural sector. This follows decades of missteps and badly designed interventions that have failed to significantly change the ownership patterns in the sector.
The latest plan – known as the agriculture and agro-processing master plan – aims to provide, among others, comprehensive farmer assistance, development finance, agricultural research and development and extension services.
It also aims to increase the share of black ownership and the contribution of small-scale producers in the country by 2030.
The master plan has been signed by government and representatives from various businesses and civil society organisations within the agricultural sector. It is the first multi-stakeholder strategic plan in the country. Its aim is to promote transformation in agriculture and agro-processing sectors affected by apartheid.
However, farming is a capital and resource intensive business, which requires access to sufficient finance. In a recent study we looked at the funding challenges facing smallholder farmers in the vegetables value chain. A smallholder farmer is someone engaged in agricultural activities on a small scale, generally farming less than 10 hectares of land, selling part of their crop and farming for subsistence.
The study provides valuable insights that could help inform the implementation of the masterplan. For example, one of the main findings is that there is an urgent need for government to provide “patient” finance – such as longer repayment periods – to allow farmers to build capabilities, accumulate returns and be profitable. The current problem with government funding is that it’s limited in both scale and scope and provided on a piecemeal basis.
This is not to suggest that there is no financing available for farmers. What’s in contention is whether what’s available helps farmers enter, expand and grow.
How financing is offered affects who gets to farm
Farming needs substantial investment in on-farm infrastructure and equipment. This includes fencing, farming tools, tractors, boreholes and pumps, irrigation systems, shade nets and greenhouse tunnels.
Research by the Centre for Competition, Regulation and Economic Development found that it can cost a farmer between R2.5 million and R3 million (around US$159,000) to install an irrigation system and greenhouse tunnels on a 5-hectare farm. These are substantial investments for smallholder farmers.
Short repayment periods mean that farmers are required to pay back their loans sometimes before they have even become profitable.
The issue of financing is particularly concerning given that smallholder farmers are self-financed or have limited access to debt finance.
As one farmer put it:
The problem why farmers are collapsing and exiting the vegetable farming business is because farmers get a loan to start farming and they make losses in the first years which means that they can’t re-pay the loan, so they start selling farm assets to repay the loan.
This is counterproductive. If a farm goes under, all the funding and non-financial support previously provided to get the enterprise started is lost.
Patient funding is the answer. Patient financing in agriculture is financing and support that’s made on a longer-term basis and that recognises the extended time frames and risks associated with agricultural cycles and the time it takes for the farmer to become profitable.
The lack of patient financing also stands in the way of farmers being able to access reliable and consistent markets, such as supermarkets. Supermarkets have stringent requirements which often entail farmers needing to invest further in their farms. The investment required can be in the form of infrastructure such as packhouses, pack sheds, cold rooms, proper financial statements, and refrigerated trucks to deliver to the stores.
Government support does not cover weather and climate change related risks. These are increasingly affecting smallholder farmers who still practise open field farming.
Many farmers also complained of complicated application forms and bureaucratic application processes to obtain finance. Often small farmers don’t have all the requirements stipulated on the forms, such as bookkeeping. This limits their chances of getting access to finance. There is also a lack of assistance from the department on how applicants can fill out the forms when they encounter difficulties.
As one farmer suggested:
The challenge with government support is that it comes and helps in piecemeal and they don’t go all the way. Also, government does not come to visit the farm to check and evaluate or monitor progress.
What needs to done
Government needs to provide patient finance to allow farmers to build capabilities, accumulate returns and be profitable.
This will safeguard the participation of smallholder farmers by allowing them to access more reliable and consistent markets. It will also benefit consumers through better quality produce and avoid potential food shortages in the wake of high inflation and the energy crisis in South Africa.
Having the agriculture and agro-processing master plan in place is helpful. But it needs to be put into practice properly. If smallholder farmers are its focus, then more emphasis needs to be placed on providing them with access to finance, to equip them with the tools to achieve better production.",South Africa’s smallholder vegetable farmers aren’t getting the finance they need: this is what it should look like,business + economy
"Containment measures, such as the lockdowns introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, had devastating consequences for vulnerable urban populations globally.
In response, public, private, and civic organisations responded with various interventions to soften the impact, especially on the most vulnerable. Support was given in the form of cash transfers, food delivery, and personal protective equipment. In Ghana, government support also included tax waivers, and subsidies for water, electricity, and other household utilities.
Government officials claimed that the interventions reduced the impact of the pandemic on urban residents. And so we sought to analyse how COVID-19 related support from families, friends, government agencies, faith based and non-governmental organisations helped reduce the pandemic’s impact on people. We looked at the impact on four aspects of their capital: financial, human, social and physical.
Our study in the Adenta municipality of the Greater Accra region found that the interventions had limited impacts. We also found that COVID-19 related support only reduced the negative impact of the pandemic on financial capital, and not on the other forms of capital. We discovered that building the residents’ capacity to bounce back after a pandemic would have required comprehensive support, and interventions that were interconnected.
Based on our findings, we recommend that decision makers should anticipate, prepare and plan for risks by focusing on the multiple factors that expose poor people living in cities to severe impacts. This should also involve collaborating with vulnerable groups to draw on their knowledge and experiences.
The everyday life of the urban resident has many aspects. These interact to create and compound their vulnerabilities to a wide range of risks. We suggest that this complex challenge should be an opportunity to rethink planning for and responses to future risks.
The realities of poor people in cities
Accra, the capital of Ghana, is home to about 5.5 million residents. The city is characterised by poor planning, widening income inequalities and slow economic growth.
Most households, especially those in informal settlements, are exposed to poor environmental and economic conditions. City authorities are grappling with high unemployment, urban sprawl and pressure on public amenities.
The first two cases of the virus were recorded in Ghana on 12 March 2020. The virus spread quickly across the country, with Accra recording the highest number of cases.
For our study, we interviewed 400 respondents in the Adenta municipality. It is a densely populated area within the capital. We asked residents to indicate their agreement with a series of statements such as “my accessibility to food was impacted by COVID-19”, “my standard of living significantly fell during the COVID-19 pandemic” and “I received support from government or religious organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic”.
The responses suggest that the pandemic affected residents’ access to economic activities and opportunities to enhance their well-being. For example, most residents were unable to engage in economic activities. This led to a drastic reduction in their already irregular incomes. Others reported that the lockdown impeded access to regular visits to friends and relatives to express support during sickness or even bereavement. For residents, this was a huge psychological burden.
A package with no punch
Our findings point to key weaknesses in the various interventions.
Firstly, they did not help people when it came to social, physical and human aspects of everyday urban living. For some residents, the inability to continue educational and skill acquisition programmes was due to cost and limited online learning options. This affected their human capital, truncating initial progress.
Secondly, the most vulnerable people weren’t always targeted. This was due to shortcomings in the way support was given. It was also due to the way beneficiaries were selected and how distribution took place.
For example, politicians and urban bureaucrats publicly claimed and highlighted the influential role of interventions by public authorities and their partners. However, our survey showed that people on the ground actually viewed the interventions as quick fixes. Some residents reported that while free food and cash transfers were necessary, they didn’t address the root cause of their impoverishment and deprivation. They wanted functional social safety nets and access to secured jobs with regular incomes.
Also, household utility subsidies  were targeted at lifeline consumers (those considered very poor) who barely made use of significant amounts of water and electricity. Consequently, these interventions appeared to have limited real impact. One community leader remarked:
We don’t need financial tokens like one-time cash transfer but other important aspects of our lives that make it possible to make our own money: productive opportunities, access to social services such as affordable and quality public transport, health care, and for those of us without high education to acquire new employable skills.
Towards multi-dimensional approaches to future risks
We outlined one approach that we argue could be beneficial – to develop community based resilient planning platforms as avenues for action oriented collaboration among public, civil society and community groups. This would help ensure that responses to current and future pandemics or uncertainties were aligned with the multiple aspects of urban living.

"Many people may be tempted to view the World Bank’s recent announcement that it will freeze new loans to Uganda because of the country’s vicious anti-LGBTIQ+ law as a harbinger of the Bank taking a more progressive approach to human rights issues.
While the announcement is welcome, based on my many years studying the Bank and on my research for my forthcoming book, The Law of the International Financial Institutions, I think there are good reasons to be cautious about its significance.
The World Bank, which has been operating for over 75 years, has 189 member states as shareholders. It funds development projects and programmes in member states that have annual per capita incomes below about US$12,535. The member states elect a Board of Executive Directors that oversees the Bank’s operations and approves all its loans.
The Bank’s Articles of Agreement stipulate that it cannot base its decisions on political grounds. The articles state that the Bank “shall not interfere in the political affairs” of its member states. Nor should its decisions be influenced by the “political character” of these states.
Moreover, the Bank is instructed that it should only pay attention “to considerations of economy and efficiency”. And that it should not be affected by “political or other non-economic influences or considerations.” 
The articles don’t define these key terms. They also don’t identify the criteria the Bank should consider when deciding if a particular issue should be excluded from consideration because it is “political” rather than “economic”.
This means that this decision is within the exclusive discretion of the Bank’s decision makers.
Division of labour
The Articles were drafted and agreed in 1944. At the time, the division of responsibilities between those who made the “political” decisions and those who made the “economic” ones seemed relatively clear. It was assumed that each Bank member state, as an exercise of its sovereignty, would decide for itself how to deal with the social, environmental, and cultural impacts and consequences of the particular transaction for which it was seeking the Bank’s support.
The Bank, on the other hand, would take the state’s decisions on these issues as given. It would merely consider if the particular loan request was technically sound and economically and financially feasible.
This division of responsibility, of course, was unrealistic. The Bank’s Board of Executive Directors must approve each loan. They represent its member states. It is inevitable that officials elected or appointed by – and ultimately accountable to states – will pay close attention to the political implications of their decisions. And that these considerations may trump the technical merits of the transaction.
Thus, inevitably, political considerations, including human rights, have always been, at least implicitly, a factor in Bank operations.
The futility of the Bank’s attempt to exclude political, including human rights, considerations from its operations can be seen at two levels. Firstly, at the level of the Bank’s relations with its member states. Secondly, at the level of individual transactions.
A good example of the Bank’s failed efforts to exclude political factors at the country level was its decision in the 1960s to lend to Portugal and South Africa to fund the construction of the Cahora Basa dam in Mozambique. The Bank decided to make this loan despite a UN General Assembly effort to impose sanctions on these countries because of their colonial and apartheid policies.
Many African states, supported by a majority of UN member countries, argued that the loan should have been denied. Their case was that the policies of the borrowers violated the human rights of their subjects. They were also a threat to regional peace and security.
The Bank’s General Counsel defended the decision on the basis of the political prohibition in the Bank’s articles and on the technical merits of the project.
Despite its ostensible non-political position, the Bank did not make any further loans to South Africa until it became a democratic state.
At the individual transaction level, the Bank funds projects and programmes that have profound social and environmental impacts. Consequently, it is forced to pay attention to some of the political, including human rights, implications of these projects and programmes.
For example, if it finances a road or a renewable energy project, the project will require land. The current occupants of the land may need to be moved to make way for the project.
Alternatively, the project may have social and environmental effects that hurt people. It could, for example, affect the surrounding community’s ability to grow food, or place the community at higher risk of accidents or exposes more young girls and women to the risk of gender-based violence.
If the affected community belong to minority groups in the country, with their own language, culture, and geographic attachments, they may qualify as indigenous people under international law and the Bank’s policies. In this case, the project may require their free, prior informed consent.
However, there are disagreements among states and between the Bank and some of its member states about which communities qualify as indigenous and what is required to ensure that their rights are respected.
For example, some states and Bank stakeholders contend that it is enough to seek the consent of the community’s leadership. But others maintain that the consent can only be established if particular vulnerable groups within the communities, such as women, youth, LGBTIQ+, or disabled people, are given specific opportunities to express their consent.
Some states may argue that giving such attention to these vulnerable groups is inconsistent with local practices and customs and that the Bank, pursuant to its own Articles, should not be interfering with these internal “political” matters.
In all these cases, the Bank has to exercise judgement. This means, for example, that in the Uganda case the Bank could decide that it should not extend any new credit to Uganda because of its new anti-LGBTQI+ legislation.
However, it is also easy to see that in another context the Bank – or its Board of Executive Directors – may conclude that on balance it is better to continue lending to the particular country despite serious human rights issues. Or to a particular project because the perceived benefits outweigh the costs.
The challenge, of course, is ensuring that the Bank is making these decisions on a principled and predictable basis. And not according to its own whims and political preferences. And that it can be held accountable for the way in which it makes the decisions.",World Bank freezes loans to Uganda because of anti-gay laws.

"The US and Kenya announced a trade and investment partnership in July 2022. Talks have been progressing on the way forward in nine areas, including agriculture, anti-corruption, digital trade, environment and climate change action, and workers’ rights and protections.
The Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) will be the first significant trade partnership between the US and a country in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries in the region currently rely on the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which offers duty- and quota-free access to the US market. The new deal is seen as a model for future agreements between the US and other sub-Saharan African countries.
The labour provisions proposed under the Kenya-US deal are not new. They have become standard features of all US free trade agreements since first appearing in the North American free trade agreement of 1994.
Kenya and the US undertake to work together:
to advance and protect labour rights through enforcement of and compliance with labour laws, promotion of social dialogue, and cooperation in other areas of mutual interest on labour and employment priorities, including with respect to forced labour in global supply chains.
There is currently very little information regarding the potential scope of the labour provisions. But there is reason to believe they will borrow heavily from precedents of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
Under the USMCA, Contracting Parties commit to four core international labour standards. These are: freedom of association and collective bargaining; elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; effective abolition of child labour; and elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
I have recently authored a paper on the labour issues raised in the proposed free trade deal between the US and Kenya. I have also studied China’s bilateral treaties and reviewed its trade deals with African countries.
Ordinarily, a trade agreement that aims at promoting workers’ rights should be welcomed. Kenya faces numerous obstacles to effective protection of the rights of workers despite having many laws with this aim. But the imposition of stringent labour standards via a trade agreement raises concerns about:
additional international obligations
high implementation costs
sovereignty
hidden motives
uneven playing field.
In my opinion, the inclusion of strong labour provisions in the STIP may have very little to do with protecting workers in Kenya. It may be more about sidelining China in Africa, protecting U.S. jobs, and enhancing US soft power in the region.
1. International obligations
The controversy over the issue of trade and labour standards is not new. Nearly thirty years ago, developing countries rejected attempts by some industrial nations to subject labour standards to World Trade Organisation rules and disciplines. Introducing them through a free trade pact implies contracting states will be required to adopt and enforce global labour laws. Including labour provisions in the STIP will have the effect of imposing additional commitments on Kenya beyond its current obligations as a member of the World Trade Organisation. Quite apart from the cost of implementation, imposing labour commitments through the backdoor of a trade agreement exposes Kenya to costly dispute settlement procedure and possible trade sanctions in event of a breach.
2. Sovereignty
The Kenyan parliament would likely play a very limited role in shaping the scope and content of the labour provisions of the trade agreement. In contrast, the US Congress plays a significant role in shaping the labour provisions of all pacts involving the US.
The limited input of Kenyan workers in the design of the labour provisions of the agreement is also a concern. By contrast, US workers and labour unions have had the opportunity to express their views on these issues. In its Strategic Plan FY 2022 – FY 2026, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) state that advancing a worker-centered trade policy “will require extensive engagement with unions, worker advocates, and underserved communities to ensure that workers’ perspectives and values play an integral and respected role in the development and implementation of U.S. trade policy.”
3. Hidden motives
It’s the US view that poor labour standards distort global markets and are a barrier to US businesses and workers competing on a level playing field.
The deal with Mexico and Canada prohibits them from importing goods from countries that use forced or compulsory labour, including forced or compulsory child labour. It provides for mandatory inspection of facilities to be sure of compliance in those countries.
Labour provisions in Kenya could therefore have a direct impact on its trade with China, member states of the East African Community and other African states. It could mean that entities that are neither American nor Kenyan are inspected.
4. Uneven playing field
While the US has the capacity and resources to monitor labour conditions in Kenya and to enforce relevant provisions of the STIP, neither the Kenyan government nor its private sector has the capacity to do so in the US. So the spotlight will be on Kenya while labour rights violations in the US are likely to be swept under the carpet.
Despite a plethora of laws and regulations purporting to protect workers in the US, violations are commonplace, particularly among migrant workers. Forced labour and human trafficking of migrant farm workers in the US is rampant.
Until recently, migrant workers in the US were coerced into continuing to work despite violations of their rights.
5. High implementation costs
The cost of implementing labour provisions is significant. Substantial resources will be required to amend laws, appoint and train inspectors, and monitor compliance. Maintaining good records, establishing labour-management committees and providing arbitration services comes with costs.
Under the deal with Mexico and Canada, a decision made by a Party on the provision of enforcement resources does not excuse a Party’s failure to comply to enforce its labor laws.
What next?
Workers are the bedrock of the global economy and deserve full protection. Including labour provisions in the STIP could transform Kenya’s labour laws. It could also put pressure on China to take workers’ rights in Africa and Kenya more seriously.
But the idea of embedding robust labour obligations in a trade agreement between Kenya and the US is highly controversial and should be weighed carefully.
Such bilateral agreements must be scrutinised to ensure that their benefits for Kenya and Kenyan workers outweigh their costs. It’s important too that labour standards are without protectionist motive or effect.
If the Kenya-US deal must contain labour provisions, I have five proposals to make:
Kenya must reject pressure to replicate the labour provisions in the US-Mexico pact. They might not be a good template.
The labour provisions should include rights enshrined in core international human rights instruments most of which are yet to be ratified by the US.
The issue of implementation costs and capacity constraints must be addressed upfront with binding long-term commitment on the US to provide necessary technical assistance and bear the implementation costs.
The failure of the US government to address labour rights and migrant rights violations in the US, including in the agriculture sector, must also be on the table.
A human rights and sustainability impact assessment of the labour provisions is necessary. Such an impact assessment should take into account vulnerable workers in Kenya including female workers, workers with disability, child workers, as well as workers in the rural areas.",Kenya and the US are negotiating a trade deal that could be a model for Africa - but its position on workers needs a rethink,business + economy
"China experienced a massive economic boom in the 1990s and 2000s which increased its demand for resource imports, like oil, from Africa. This led to a model of development finance in which China funded infrastructure in African countries in return for access to resources. This approach became known as the Angola model, because it all started with an infrastructure-for-petroleum partnership between China and Angola in 2004.
Within a decade, however, a shift in China’s approach was needed, for a couple of reasons.
First, African countries are vulnerable to shocks and they struggle to keep up with mounting debt repayments. For instance, in Angola’s case, the price of oil fell from a high of US$115 to below US$50 in mid-2014. More recently, the impact of COVID’s economic shutdowns and supply shocks around the war on Ukraine are taking a toll.
Second, China’s domestic needs are changing. In recent years, climate change and changing diets have put pressure on China’s domestic supply of food. This triggered interest in partnerships that could help. China is also moving away from being an exporter of heavy-industry and energy-intensive manufactured goods. Its focus is more on growth areas, such as higher value-added agriculture and manufacturing. Geopolitically, it also wants to support African development and its own food security.
My study of these shifts reveals a changing relationship between China and Africa, moving beyond a focus on mainly oil and extractive commodities. The new focus is more on industrial production, job creation, investments that lead to African exports, and productivity-enhancing agricultural and digital technology opportunities.
This model, called the “Hunan model”, is named after the province in southern China that is leading the push. African bureaucrats, researchers, trade associations and businesses should understand what’s happening in Hunan. It’ll help them to grasp new opportunities and ensure that African companies are competitively placed.
What is the ‘Hunan model’?
The Hunan model aims to support the 2035 Vision for China–Africa Cooperation by pushing for:
medical cooperation
poverty reduction and agricultural development
trade
investment
digital innovation
green development
capacity building
cultural and people-to-people exchange
peace and security.
The delivery of those goals happens under the umbrella of the China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo and a pilot zone for in-depth China-Africa Economic and Trade Cooperation. Both are centred on Changsha, the capital of Hunan province.
Hunan province was chosen as the new frontier of China-Africa relations partly because many of China’s competitive industries are based there. They include major agri-tech companies, a leading Chinese electronic vehicle company (BYD Changsha), and manufacturing equipment and construction industry companies. Many of these companies have a presence in, and long-run strategy for, African markets.
China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo
The China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo has many activities and events hosted in big exhibition centres. This allows new business partnerships to be forged with speed and logistical ease. At a 2023 event with 10,000 Chinese and 1,700 foreign participants, it was reported that 120 projects, worth a total of US$10.3 billion, were signed. All 53 African countries with which China has diplomatic relations were present.

Pilot zone
The pilot zone for in-depth China-Africa Economic and Trade Cooperation is a huge area that’s been developed with the aim of expanding bilateral trade, dealing with bottlenecks in trade and cooperation and improving logistics between the two regions. Examples of typical bottlenecks include market access, finance, logistics, talent and services such as marketing and law.
Some of the initiatives that can be found in the pilot zone include vocational and education training and a digital services hub that supports Chinese companies in the efforts to economically engage Africa. The zone includes a permanent exhibition platform and a demonstration park.
Some implications of the shift
The Hunan model’s specific focus is on agriculture, heavy industry equipment, and transport such as electric automobiles and trains. These are areas where Hunan is a leader within China. And they are growth industries in many countries in Africa.
For China it may lead to new sources of food security as well as new markets for technology products and opportunities to set technology standards. The approach thus places Africa in an important position for grasping new opportunities and shaping related areas of cooperation – at home, with China and globally.
The Hunan model also seeks to support more efficient trade. New trade passageways by rail, river, air and ocean are being forged to better connect Hunan with African countries, especially trade hubs.
There are also efforts to tackle issues of access to foreign exchange and foster greater use of local currencies. At the moment a lot of international trade is done in the US dollar, because it is widely accepted across all countries. But many developing countries struggle to accumulate dollars if they don’t have a commodity like oil or gas to export. Small and medium-sized (SME) traders struggle in particular, and are less able to bear any currency risks against the value of their own local currency. The zone in Hunan includes a centre that is testing trade payment systems based on other currencies. This could become a broader model for SME-based trade in local currencies.
Ultimately, China’s Hunan agenda will mean different things for different African countries and will evolve over time. It’s a recent shift, since 2018 especially, but beyond its potential to elevate food security and production capacity in China and African countries, there will be other important implications. It may facilitate digital and communications logistics for trade between China and Africa, as well as research on technology, industry and trade standards, and trade flows and trends.",China’s Africa strategy is shifting from extraction to investment – driven from the industry-rich Hunan region,business + economy
"Many African tax authorities have weak capacity to raise revenue. From 1990 to 2020, sub-Saharan African countries on average collected only about 12%-15% of GDP as taxes, a much lower share than the 33.5% in OECD economies.
For countries that have limited information about taxpayers, constrained resources and informal economies, it can be difficult to collect revenue. What’s more, African tax administrations tend to rely on manual filing and payment of taxes. In-person interactions between taxpayers and tax officials are common, creating opportunities for collusion when paying taxes. African taxpayers also experience higher compliance costs than similar regions when navigating opaque tax systems.
Kenya has faced many of these challenges. To streamline processes and make them more transparent, the country has in the last decade begun to digitise public services like tax collection. Digitisation also aims to enhance taxpayer identification and monitoring capacity, and lower the costs of compliance for taxpayers.
In the latest policy reforms, the country plans to introduce digital identity documents for all Kenyans by February 2024. A digital ID system, e-ID, uses digital technology across the entire ID lifecycle: capturing, validating, storing and transferring data.
In Kenya, each citizen will receive a unique personal identifier. It will be crucial throughout a child’s journey in school. From the age of 18, the identifier will become an official national identity number for access to the full range of public services.
At the same time, Kenya is on course to eliminate cash transactions for all government services. These services include business registration, passport services, and land and property services in 2023.
Combining mandatory electronic tax payment and e-IDs could greatly improve revenue collection and efficiency, and cut taxpayers’ compliance costs.
Electronic filing of taxes has been mandatory since 2016 to collect taxes on employment, business and rental incomes. The system supports a wide range of tasks, from registrations to refunds. Taxpayers can still pay taxes using cash, however, by visiting authorised banks or Kenya Revenue Authority service centres. Universal e-payment of taxes is expected to change all that.
We have between us years of research in governance, public finance and taxation conducted in African countries. Our view is that a number of challenges and constraints need to be considered to unlock the benefits of a fully digitised tax administration, not just in Kenya but elsewhere.
Technology and taxation
Technology can strengthen tax administration in at least three ways:
1. Identifying the tax base: using third-party information, technology can create comprehensive databases of taxable subjects, making it easier to determine what tax is payable. Kenya’s digital ID would improve the way government databases work together and the revenue collector’s “view” of taxpayers.
2. Enforcing compliance: technology can automatically check what a taxpayer reports against other data sources. Efficient e-filing platforms can automatically identify missed or late declarations. The unique identifiers provided by an ID scheme make this work.
3. Facilitating compliance: tax e-filing and e-payment can help reduce compliance costs. They improve record-keeping and eliminate travel, queuing and capricious manual practices from tax officials. And the biographic information in the digital ID database helps with tax registration.
But evidence suggests that important preconditions must be met for IT-based tax reforms to succeed.
In the case of Kenya, accessibility and taxpayer costs should be policy priorities when mandating e-payment. A recent study on tax e-filing, for instance, revealed that not everyone had access to devices necessary for e-filing, and there were language barriers. These practical challenges typically pushed taxpayers to use intermediaries: they went back to a manual, in-person experience.
These shortcomings increase the risk of errors, misuse of personal data and bribery. Less tech-savvy taxpayers might be vulnerable. As filing levels are already poor, e-payment solutions should make it easier, not harder, to comply.
Lessons from other countries
E-services help improve filing accuracy and timeliness, but one lesson from our research is that this does not always translate into higher tax revenue.
Positive impacts can be short-lived, as adoption of digital merchant payments in Rwanda indicates. Here, taxpayers quickly reverted to pre-adoption compliance levels. Similarly, in Ethiopia, the adoption of point-of-sale electronic tax devices increased revenues, but gains were offset by taxpayers inflating other, less verifiable margins.
Making digital systems compulsory, as in Rwanda and Eswatini, does not necessarily lead to people using them. Digital divides emerge between adopters and non-adopters. The less equipped, more marginalised and less tech-savvy taxpayers fail to take up the tools.
Our research also shows that digital ID schemes must meet several conditions for tax administrations to benefit meaningfully. Digital IDs must be universally adopted. Identification data should be accurate and up to date. Strong cooperation across government entities is necessary to allow data sharing, as we’ve seen in our ongoing work in Uganda and Ghana.
Which way for Kenya?
The government and tax administration must be cautious about digital IDs. Poor-quality and outdated data from e-ID could be damaging to the Kenya Revenue Authority’s functions. The institutions involved should promote a culture of information updating in the population. They should encourage citizens to share valid information with the government.
It’s vital to establish a robust data protection framework and digital trust, especially after the failure of the country’s National Integrated Identity Management System. Citizens need clarity on data usage and how the new project differs from the previous one if they are to trust the digital ID system.
Similarly, the government and revenue authority must support citizens to move towards fully digitised tax payments. They can do this by creating systems that are simple and secure, and by providing assistance and training.
The development of e-government must happen along with a framework for data protection and cyber-security response infrastructure. Besides threatening citizens’ data privacy and security, system failures – like the one that recently disrupted access to multiple services on the e-Citizen portal – have extremely serious repercussions on citizens’ trust in government and technology.

"Fintechs, notably mobile money, have transformed banking and finance in developing and emerging economies in Africa and beyond. Financial technology (better known as fintech) is used to describe new technology that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services.
Mobile money in Africa was spearheaded by Kenya’s M-Pesa in 2007. Ghana’s MTN MoMo followed in 2009. Mobile money is a pay-as-you-go digital medium of exchange and store of value using mobile money accounts and a mobile phone.
In Ghana, the volume of mobile money transactions increased from 2.85billion in 2020 to 4.26 billion in 2021, representing a 48.6 per cent growth. Similarly, the total value of transactions increased to GH¢ 978.32 billion ($87 billion) in 2021, from GH¢ 571.80 billion ($50 billion) in 2020 according to the central bank.
Over the last ten years, mobile money has gone beyond sending and receiving money to several other services including accessing microcredit. Mobile money accounts are now seamlessly linked to bank accounts.
The fintech boom has brought obvious benefits to a number of African countries, particularly in promoting financial inclusion. But there hasn’t been a sufficiently critical conversation about who actually benefits from the growth of digital finance.
What exactly is the political economy of fintech-led financial inclusion in Ghana and across Africa? How has it expressed itself in Ghana’s mobile money industry? And to what extent do the outcomes in Ghana reflect wider conversations about global finance capitalism?
I am a Research Associate and PhD candidate at the Africa Multiple Cluster, currently studying the political economy of money and finance in Ghana. In a recently published paper based on my research, I examine whether or not increased access to financial services through the delivery of mobile money services has helped poor people. My findings raise serious concerns about the current state of digital finance in Ghana.
In particular, I found that they have been accompanied by higher customer indebtedness from digital microloans, high and multiple transaction costs, excessive taxation due to a recently introduced tax, and a prevalence of dormant accounts.
My research shows that far from ending poverty, financial inclusion has opened new frontiers of exploitation. This is particularly true for poor and working class Ghanaians. Many of the problems identified in my research have been raised by Ghanaians using mobile money banking services. But their complaints have been ignored. It is time this changed and their concerns were taken seriously.
Findings
My study relied on two sources of data. One was the central bank’s payment systems data (2012-2021). I also conducted 42 interviews made up of 32 mobile money customers and 10 mobile money agents across seven regions of the country.
My research found a number of problems.
Firstly, that digital loans for instance are usually small amounts. They are therefore incapable of supporting social entrepreneurship. Yet they attract significant interest rates (averagely 6.9%) over a 30-day repayment period. The result is that borrowers get into debt juggling, borrowing from one subscriber to repay others and simply buying time. Of course, most borrowers are unable to ‘buy enough time’ before they default and fall into a debt trap that can lead to other problems. As one person put it:
I owe them for so many months. My brother, I am a graduate but as you know there are no opportunities. The only thing is for me to bet, maybe I will win big so I can pay them
Secondly, that transactions are expensive. This is because there are multiple charges for transfers and withdrawals ranging between 1% and 5%.
Thirdly, that a recently introduced tax has further raised costs. The government put in place an electronic transactions levy in 2022.
The way the tax works is that as the transaction amount increases, subscribers can pay up paying up twice or more of the original transaction fee.

Users have been up in arms.
As one put it:
How can you tax the same money several times? I work, and at the end of the month receive salary, which I have already paid tax and when I send part of it to my mother in the village, you will tax it again. Imagine she wants to send part of it to another relative, and you tax it again.
Broader problems
The problems identified by users of mobile money services aren’t the only challenges facing the sector.
Key ones include:
Regulation: there isn’t enough regulation of the pricing of digital financial services. Existing legal requirements in Ghana don’t impose limits on digital transaction charges. These regulations have to be expanded to limit how much fintechs can charge for money transfers and withdrawals as well as interests on microloans.
Customers’ complaints about multiple transaction fees are being ignored by government.
About 50% of registered mobile money accounts lie dormant as subscribers resort to alternative modes of money transfer in their attempt to avoid transaction costs and debt. This has raised the cost burden for both corporations and government who struggle to retrieve taxes and loans owed by these accounts.
Lastly, I conclude in my paper that although fintech has improved the ease and speed of financial transactions it nevertheless has heralded in a set of new problems.

"Imagine you’ve found yourself in a difficult financial situation and needed to raise R40,000 (more than US$2,000) on the spot. Where and how would you raise these funds? Or what if a financial emergency has just taken a grip of your household? Which resources would you draw upon to address the problem?
If these scenarios ring true, you’re not alone. Many households are struggling to cope with unexpected financial expenses as interest rates and costs of living rise. With the global economy recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, developing countries have been worse off. As many as 64% of households reported a decrease in income. And South Africa was no exception.
A recent study found that 61% of South Africans were financially stressed and struggled to meet their basic financial commitments due to a shortage of money. Further, close to 40% of respondents believed that their financial situation had worsened since 2022.
This points to a need for financial resilience.
Financial resilience is the ability to withstand and recover from financial shocks, such as an unexpected expense in a time of crisis. To understand the state of financial resilience, and the financial resources that build financial resilience, we studied a nationally representative sample of 4,880 South African households across nine provinces.
We have been researching financial planning in South Africa and are interested in the gender dynamics in household savings. Our research found that women were, in general, more likely than men to be financially vulnerable. We also found that insurance and retirement savings were the most effective tools for increasing financial resilience.
Measuring resilience
We constructed an index to measure financial resilience. It was made up of the availability of savings, insurance, credit and retirement savings. Access to these instruments is a financial safety net that one can rely on in times of need. We considered access to both formal and informal sources of finance for savings, including banks, non-banks, informal savings clubs and savings at home.
We also included in our analysis credit from banks, non-banks, informal credit providers, and family or friends. Insurance encompassed both life and medical insurance. Finally, we examined retirement savings as contributions towards compulsory retirement funds (such as pension or provident funds) and/or voluntary retirement annuity funds.

Our research also sought to examine the demographic and socioeconomic factors that could explain the differences in the levels of financial resilience between households.
What we found
Overall, we found low levels of financial resilience across the sample. Surprisingly, we found that insurance is the greatest contributor to building household financial resilience, followed by retirement provisions, savings and credit. However, we found that a gender gap in financial resilience exists, with men being more financially resilient than women.
We also found that the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that are common between men and women also differentiate their resources levels in building financial resilience. In other words, some demographic groups have better access to financial products than others. For example, men between the ages of 45 and 59 have the highest levels of financial resilience compared to women across all age groups. Since men have higher rates of labour market participation and greater access to financial services, they also accumulate more wealth and have greater financial security.
On the other hand, when race is considered, we found that black and white men were more financially resilient than their female counterparts. White women remained more financially resilient than black women. Black women need to contend with the double burden of race and gender to overcome financial vulnerability.

We also observed a gender gap in financial resilience, in favour of men, across urban and rural areas (such as farming areas and traditional villages). Financial resilience was highest among people residing in urban areas. Households in rural or farming areas tend to be excluded from mainstream financial markets, which makes it difficult to build financial resilience.
We found that access to economic and education opportunities increased financial resilience for women. Women with jobs and those with tertiary education were more financially resilient than their male counterparts. This reiterates the importance of women having independent access to income as it improves their economic bargaining power.
How to improve resilience
To improve the ability to withstand financial shocks, a few key interventions are necessary.
First, the uptake of life and medical insurance is strongly connected to financial resilience and can help South African households overcome an unexpected crisis. Further, policies aimed at building reserves in savings and enhancing access to credit facilities among vulnerable households can improve levels of financial resilience and economic security.
Since we also established that retirement provisions are a driver of financial resilience, premature access to retirement savings should be discouraged. Particularly if it’s consumption driven. The new two-pot retirement saving system – which proposes that a portion of retirement benefits can be withdrawn prematurely – may be helpful in the short term. But it could lead to financial vulnerability during one’s retirement years.
Read more: South Africa needs to be creative to avoid falling off the retirement cliff
Second, evidence of a gender gap in financial resilience calls for the design of gender-inclusive policies and interventions. More specifically in the access and use of financial services. Current practices of charging higher interest rates to those who are financially excluded typically disadvantages women as they have less access to financial services than men. Eliminating this policy can contribute towards improving access to financial products in a way that’s both gender-neutral and equitable.
In addition, racial and geographic location gaps in financial resilience are underpinned by gaps in access to financial services. This needs to be considered in national policies, such as the financial inclusion strategy, with clear targets set for closing such gaps.
Exposure to economic risks, whether anticipated or unexpected, is a reality we must all contend with. The ability to withstand and overcome these risks is a good indicator of financial resilience. Having adequate and equitable access to financial products and services remains the cornerstone of financial resilience.",How to build financial resilience: insurance and retirement savings are the most effective tools in South Africa – study,business + economy
"Throughout the world, governments impose excise taxes on products like alcohol and tobacco to reduce their demand. The South African government has implemented a tax on vaping products for the same reason. Reducing demand is necessary as there is growing evidence that vaping products are not harmless.
The new vaping tax has enraged vaping lobby groups and vaping manufacturers. The vaping industry argues that e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional cigarettes. It also claims that the tax will spawn an illicit industry, that people will go back to smoking traditional cigarettes, and the tax will not dissuade the youth from starting vaping.
In one article the industry claims that the excise tax will increase the retail price of e-cigarettes by more than 100%. Another article claims that the retail price will increase by 217%.
Drawing from the work of the Research Unit on the Economics of Excisable Products where we are based, this article analyses the price increase claims and the effectiveness of the excise tax regime on vaping products. We do not explore the rest of the industry’s claims - government has already responded to some.
We conclude that the vaping tax is flawed because it is not well-targeted at reducing the consumption of vaping products among the youth. Young people who are starting to vape are more likely to buy disposable vapes, which attract less tax. As currently structured, the excise tax is not sufficiently targeted at reducing, or preventing, the use of vaping products among youth.
Youth and lifelong addiction
Disposable vapes, which are closed systems thrown away once the liquid is finished, have become increasingly popular among the youth. These are not teenagers switching from smoking cigarettes to e-cigarettes, but rather teenagers who are initiating a potential lifelong addiction to nicotine through vapes. The vaping industry claims it sells only to people aged 18 and older, but this isn’t true.
In 2022, nine schools (both publicly and privately funded) in three South African provinces were surveyed. Among the 5,583 learners in grades 8-12 (high school learners) who completed the survey, 15% used vaping devices. The prevalence is higher among grade 11 (17%) and grade 12 learners (27%).
Read more: Marketers are targeting teens with cheap and addictive vapes: 9 ways to stem rising rates of youth vaping
These high prevalence rates are not surprising given that vaping devices are marketed to the youth. Vaping devices come in many shapes, flavours and colours. One vape sold on online retailer Takealot is shaped as an ice lolly. Airspops disposable vapes, made by a UK company called Airscream, are very popular in South Africa. Retail chain Pick n Pay sells a 3ml AirsPops for R95 (US$5) (the price had not changed since at least August 2022 to 14 June 2023).
The fact that the retail price for these products has not changed suggests that the new excise tax is either absorbed by the industry or there is old stock on the market. AirsPops are also sold at retail chain Spar, by informal traders, and online (for instance, on Takealot, together with many other brands of disposable vapes).
Read more: Vaping and behaviour in schools: what does the research tell us?
There is growing competition in both the closed disposables vapes market and the open systems market. Open systems allow the user to refill the liquid in a vaping device. E-liquids are sold in a variety of nicotine strengths and volumes (typically from 20 ml to 100 ml). Nicotine-free e-liquids are not supposed to contain nicotine, although trace quantities are sometimes present. The increased competition in the vaping market has put downward pressure on e-liquid prices.
Since 2004, the National Treasury has targeted an excise tax burden of 40% on cigarettes. This means that the excise tax should be set such that it comprises 40% of the recommended retail price of popular-priced cigarettes. Since the excise tax on cigarettes is set as a specific tax (in 2023/24, the rate is R20.80 per pack of 20 cigarettes), higher-priced cigarettes are subject to a lower tax incidence, and lower-priced cigarettes to a higher tax incidence.
In recent years the excise tax increases have generally exceeded the retail price increases, with the result that the average excise tax incidence has increased and is currently about 45% for popular-price cigarettes. If VAT is included, the total tax incidence on popular-priced cigarettes is around 58%.
While equivalence with cigarette taxation is a controversial topic, the current tax on e-cigarettes yields tax burdens consistently below the tobacco tax burdens (except for the 100ml e-liquid). (See table 1 in the original article). The new tax will affect disposables the least, and e-liquids sold in large containers the most.
Users of 100 ml bottles of e-liquid are likely to be seasoned vapers and are more likely to vape as an alternative to smoking cigarettes. Youths who are experimenting with or starting vaping are not likely to purchase large containers of e-liquid; they would typically start with disposable vapes.
This is a problem, because the excise tax is not well-targeted at reducing the consumption of vaping products among the youth. In our submissions to the National Treasury and Parliament’s Select Committee of Finance, we argued that in order to address this anomaly the government should implement a minimum excise tax amount. We suggested a minimum tax amount of R50 per unit/container.
Such a minimum amount would have no additional tax impact for e-liquid containers with more than 17.5 ml, but would have an impact on small-volume containers, especially disposables [(See table 2 in the original article)]. The tax incidence on a 2ml Vuse disposable would increase from 6% to 37%. The tax incidence of e-liquid (sold in units of 20 ml or more) would remain the same.
Other than imposing a minimum excise tax on all vaping products, we propose that the National Treasury should, each year, increase the excise tax on e-cigarettes by the inflation rate, plus a pre-announced additional percentage. This will ensure that e-cigarettes become less affordable over time. Pre-announced tax changes are done in countries such as Australia, which increased the excise tax on cigarettes by 12.5% above the nominal increase in average wages for eight consecutive years from 2013 to 2020. Through a multi-year approach, tax increases are more predictable.
Addressing the flaws
The vaping industry’s response to the excise tax on vaping e-liquid has been predictably fierce. By focusing only on large containers, the industry has created the impression that the tax increases will have a large impact on the prices of all vaping products. However, these large containers comprise only a modest proportion of the market. Most vaping products will experience only limited price increases under the new tax. A concern for the public health community is that vaping products that are most used by youth are subject to the lowest tax burden.
South Africa does not need a new epidemic of addiction. The excise tax on vaping products will go some way to reduce the demand for these products. Unfortunately, there are flaws in the current tax system. We hope that National Treasury will address these in future Budgets.

"The notion of “degrowth” is gaining traction among some politicians in Europe. It was given a platform recently at the European Parliament’s “Beyond Growth” conference.
Jason Hickel, an economic anthropologist and one of the main advocates of degrowth, defines it as
a planned reduction of energy and resource use designed to bring the economy back into balance with the living world in a way that reduces inequality and improves human wellbeing.
The degrowth movement’s belief is that other approaches to the ecological crisis, such as green growth and the sustainable development goals, are futile. That’s because these approaches are rooted in democratic capitalism, which is obsessed with economic growth. Therefore the movement calls for a “radical political project” that would displace capitalism and “de-grow” the west. The global south is exempt.
So far, the economic mainstream has been dismissive of degrowth, considering it perhaps not even worth engaging with. Critical analyses by Ted Nordhaus and other leading economists such as Branko Milanovic and Andrew MacAfee remains confined to blog-style pieces.
The degrowth movement does, however, raise very valid criticisms against economic growth and the Green Growth paradigm that underpins the current mainstream approach to tackling the ecological crisis. But do they offer valid solutions? Are the only two options facing us either ecological collapse or degrowth? Will degrowth save the world as Jason Hickel confidently proclaims?
In several recent scholarly papers, published by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, I argue that the proposal for degrowth is not a solution for the ecological crisis or for the shortcomings of democratic capitalism.
Degrowth would be ineffective and might be even worse for the environment. Degrowth in industrialised countries would hit developing countries hard because of economic interdependencies.
The west has been experiencing degrowth conditions (the “great stagnation”) for decades. This experiment has resulted in many social and political ills. The degrowth movement itself is a reaction against degrowth.
Flaws in the argument
Proponents of degrowth argue that reducing the gross domestic product (GDP) of advanced economies would cut carbon emissions enough to avoid an ecological overshoot.
But my argument is that merely reducing the GDP of developed countries would have no significant impact on the world’s overall material footprint.
Most current carbon emissions (63%) come from developing countries where emissions will continue to increase. China, for example, is building the equivalent of two new coal-fired power plants every week.
Many of the world’s major carbon pollutors – fossil fuel companies – are located in the global south. They include Saudi Aramco, National Iranian Oil, Petroleos Mexicanos, PetroChina, Petroleos de Venezuela and Kuwait Petroleum. They are also government owned or controlled, which makes it rather strange that Jason Hickel is advocating nationalisation of fossil fuel companies as a degrowth-solution…
Degrowth considers the global south to be exempt from degrowth. This is an implicit acknowledgement that degrowth can do harm. The movement has also argued that developed countries should compensate the global south. This implies giving a free pass to global south polluters whose fossil fuel rich governments will get trillions in reparation money to further invest in their polluting industries.
Degrowth would also be ineffective. Most of its key proposals are likely to stimulate economic growth and consumption, not curtail it. For example, the degrowth movement calls for energy sufficiency, basic income grants and four-day working weeks. It proposes banning advertising. All of these may be subject to rebound effects – they would actually stimulate economic growth and materialisation of the economy.
But degrowth might not only be ineffective in reducing ecological overshoot. It might turn out to be dirty.
First, redistribution towards less developed countries, as degrowth proposes, would stimulate economic growth and aggregate consumption growth in developing countries. Strangely, although degrowthers reject neoclassical economic growth theory, they seem to adhere to its tenet that redistribution has no effect on economic growth.
Second, with reduced income, developed countries would have fewer resources to invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies. Degrowthers may counter that countries could just reallocate their expenditure away from conspicuous consumption towards such green investment. But that would be inconsistent with the fact that the most innovative countries are not Jason Hickel’s poster-children such as Sri Lanka or Cuba, but those with the highest GDP, such as the USA and Switzerland. Innovation costs money. Kate Raworth is therefore mistaken when she claims that “boundaries unleash creativity.”
With resources and innovation under degrowth pressure, firms might simply replace expensive cleaner production techniques with cheaper, but more polluting ones. And without future growth, debt would contract, starving risky but necessary investment projects.
The upshot is that degrowth would leave the world more vulnerable to the impacts of ecological deterioration.
Degrowth might also harm developing countries because of the intertwined nature of the global economy. This might disproportionately hurt the poorest of the poor – and make global inequality worse.
The COVID-19 crisis emphasised this inter-dependency. Poverty rose more sharply in the global south than in the global north. The impact of the pandemic indicated how difficult it would be for the south to decouple from the north.
Degrowth and dictatorship
Because of these shortcomings, degrowth is politically unfeasible. Democracy and degrowth are inherently uncomfortable bedfellows. The only example in history of a sustainable and thriving stationary (non-growing) society was Japan during the Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603-1868). It was, however, a “brutal dictatorship”.
Given that a democracy is unlikely to choose degrowth voluntarily, the degrowth movement may set the west on a dangerous path towards rejecting democracy and reverting to an authoritarian collective.
The degrowth movement thinks that material use and carbon emissions cannot be decoupled from economic growth, but that innovation, creativity, happiness and social progress can. This ignores how much social progress has accompanied the last two centuries of economic growth.
The physicist Tom Murphy, who has stressed the limits to economic growth, has warned that
In times of plenty, we can afford to be kind to those who are different. We are less threatened when we are comfortable. If our 21st Century standard of living peaks […] then we may not have the luxury of viewing our social progress as an irreversible ratchet. Hard times revive old tribal instincts: different is not welcome.

"Global fertiliser suppliers have made incredibly high profits in 2022/23 on the back of price spikes attributed to the Russia-Ukraine war. The profits of the world’s top nine producers trebled in 2022 from two years previously.
The margins and impacts have been even greater on fertiliser supplies to African farmers. Moreover, the super-high profit margins are being sustained in 2023 in many African countries even while international prices have come down (see figure 1). The harvest season has recently come to an end in most countries in southern Africa with farmer margins and production being squeezed by high input costs.
Urea prices in East and Southern Africa. World price is from the World Bank; South African price is inland, from Grain SA. East Africa is the average of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Prices are given before any government subsidies. Source: Compiled from different sources by the African Market Observatory
The wide gaps between fertiliser prices in the region and international fertiliser prices point to major issues within the supply chain with excess margins of some 30%-80% being earned on sales to many African countries.
South Africa has the benefit of robust competition enforcement meaning prices in this country have come down substantially. This only serves to highlight the disadvantage being faced by farmers in other countries such as Malawi and Zambia.
High fertiliser prices undermine production, contribute to high food prices, and exacerbate food insecurity.
Our work on fertiliser and agri-food markets in the African Market Observatory points to major problems with how international and regional markets work, including the market power of large international suppliers. High prices for fertiliser inputs are squeezing African farmers who are cutting back on fertiliser use meaning low yields and supply, and high food prices.
International action is therefore urgently required on fertiliser prices to improve food security in Africa.
Impact
African countries are dependent on imported fertiliser and usage is relatively low. For example, Kenya and Zambia use around 70kg/ha, compared with 365kg/ha in Brazil.
Production
The harvest season has recently come to an end in most countries in southern Africa. There’s evidence that farmer margins and production are being squeezed by high input costs. High costs and low application are a factor in maize yields in Zambia being less than half of those in South Africa and a third of Argentina (according to the FAO).
In 2022, Kenya imported almost 30% less fertiliser and production fell. Maize output in 2022/23 was 18% lower than the average for the previous five year, with yields and area planted both being lower, compounding the effect of poor rains. This has meant a substantial deficit relative to local demand and very high prices.
Continued high fertiliser prices will constrain production, even while there is a great need to expand agriculture output to meet regional demand.
For example, Zambia has abundant arable land and water for agriculture to increase production. Of the country’s 42 million hectares of arable land, only 15% (or around 6 million) is under cultivation, including for pasture, with only 1.5 million of this cultivated for crop production. Zambia has around 40% of the water resources available for agriculture in the entire SADC region.
If farmers earned better returns, with cheaper input costs, then production could be a multiple of the current levels.
Food insecurity: Approximately 73 million people in the East and Southern Africa region are experiencing acute food insecurity. People in low- and middle-income countries bear the harshest burden – both in terms of the importance of small-holder farmers and in the vulnerability of low-income urban households to high food prices.
Most countries on the continent rely on food imports. Countries such as Kenya which have been affected by drought are struggling to source imports which has worsened food security in the country. This has been exacerbated by export restrictions on maize imposed by Zambia and Tanzania, which have suppressed prices to farmers in those countries, even while input costs, notably fertilizer, have increased.
Uneven playing field
International fertilizer prices more than doubled in two months – from September to November 2021. The peak continued into early 2022, reaching an average price of US$915/t for the benchmark urea fertilizer between March and April 2022. This compares with around US$226 in the previous five years. This was driven by the world’s largest fertilizer companies taking advantage of the rise in the price of natural gas, an important input for nitrogen-based fertilizer, as well as supply disruptions associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. The fertilizer companies exploited the shocks and raised prices by more than the increase in costs.
By March 2023, the international price of urea had fallen back to close to $300/t. With additional costs to import to coastal countries which should be no more than $150/t and to inland regions no more than $250/t including a trader margin, South Africa’s inland prices now reflect fair prices but in other African countries super profits are continuing.
What needs to be done
To ease the adverse impacts of high fertilizer prices, governments in the region have tried to implement fertilizer subsidy programmes. For example, prices in Tanzania with the government subsidy have been reduced from around $1100/t to US$600-700/t.
But the subsidies have huge costs for governments which many African countries have not been able to incur, while the programmes have generally not been working well. In Malawi, for example, a large portion of the Affordable Inputs Programme (AIP) targeted beneficiaries did not receive fertilizer under the 2022/2023 programme.
International action is therefore urgently required on fertilizer prices to improve food security in Africa. First, competition authorities in Africa should investigate signs of anti-competitive conduct. Second, investments are required in logistics, storage and advice on optimal usage. Third, a fertilizer market observatory as the EU is currently setting-up would provide ongoing data about fertiliser markets, factors affecting them, and exchange experiences and good practices for optimal usage.",Food crisis in Africa: the high cost of imported fertilisers is adding to the problem,business + economy
"Zimbabwe is facing a host of pressing challenges that voters dearly want the next president to address. Persistently high inflation, elevated interest rates, and a slumping and volatile Zimbabwe dollar have combined to fuel a cost of living crisis for households and battered business activity.
These will be among the key economic concerns weighing on Zimbabweans as they prepare to cast their votes at elections scheduled for late August. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is campaigning to secure a second mandate that will extend his five-year term in power. He will square off against 10 presidential candidates, including the opposition’s main candidate Nelson Chamisa.
Inflation remains sticky and jumped 175.8% in June from 86.5% a month ago. Part of the recent re-acceleration in inflation was triggered by the Zimbabwe dollar’s slide, which plunged 85% in the two months through May and pushed up import costs. Although inflation edged lower in July, it still remains significantly elevated.
The central bank responded by hiking interest rates to 150% from a previously elevated level of 140%. This move intensifies the pullback on business and consumer spending caused by currency weakening. Additionally, the high pace of price growth has outpaced nominal wage growth, leaving many people struggling to afford everyday essentials. Fewer jobs add to these concerns.
Stubbornly high inflation and its negative impact on the value of the Zimbabwe dollar are symptoms of much deeper problems rooted in decades of fiscal and central bank governance weaknesses. That’s why inflation has defied central bank efforts to rein it in with a series of aggressive rate hikes.
The next president will therefore need to push for reforms in governance to tackle deep underlying problems. Otherwise the country will remain locked in a seemingly endless battle to ward off the economic crisis that is being acutely felt by voters.
Governance vulnerabilities
Governance broadly refers to institutions used to exercise authority by the government. Long-running weaknesses in fiscal and central bank governance institutions have undermined the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound fiscal and monetary policies for many years.
Between 2005 and 2008 for example, the government pursued an expansionary fiscal policy. Public spending averaged 8% of GDP.
However, because of weak budgetary processes, spending was less efficient especially in areas critical for supporting stronger growth such as education, health, and public infrastructure. This meant that the economy could not generate more government revenue. Average government revenue collected was only about 5% of GDP over this period. The budget shortfalls were financed by printing money, which undermined the independence and credibility of the central bank. This impaired the central bank’s ability to fulfill its mandate, including supporting price stability.
The influx of printed cash in the economy fanned domestic demand but did nothing to spur the production of goods and services to meet it. Inflation spiked and drove the value of the currency lower, raising the cost of imported goods and thus amplifying inflation pressures.
This dynamic created a feedback loop in which rising inflation and a weakening currency reinforced each other. The result was hyperinflation. In 2008 inflation reached 231 million %, prompting the government to withdraw the weakening Zimbabwe dollar from circulation the following year and to replace it with the US dollar to combat hyperinflation.
In the years following the switch to the US dollar, inflation receded until 2019 when the Zimbabwe dollar was re-introduced. This was done without fixing vulnerabilities in fiscal and monetary governance that had eventually led to the demise of the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009.
Because of these vulnerabilities, inflation skyrocketed to 255% in 2019 – a 23-fold increase from a year earlier as money supply growth quickened from 28% to 250% amid a widening government budget deficit which topped 10% of GDP in 2017. Since then, the central bank has not been able to get a sustained deceleration in inflation despite aggressive rate hikes.
And the negative feedback loop between high inflation and a collapsing local currency was on full display again following the plunge in the currency in recent months. This has made the US dollar more attractive, and it is used more widely to pay for everything from food, fuel, school fees, rent and other services. In February the central bank adopted a new inflation gauge that tracks prices in both Zimbabwean and US dollars to capture this reality.
The US dollar is also seen as a haven which has taken on greater importance as inflation remains stubbornly high. In many ways, the return of the Zimbabwe dollar evokes bad memories of the inflation crisis of 2008 which still loom large for many people.
Weaknesses in governance breed corruption
Weaknesses in governance also create opportunities for higher levels of government corruption, which can lead to public spending waste, inefficiencies and lower revenue collection. All worsen budget deficits and add to monetary financing pressures on a central bank lacking independence.
In 2022, Transparency International ranked Zimbabwe 157 out of 180 countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption, where the lower the rank the higher the perceived corruption. The evidence also showed no significant progress in tackling corruption for more than a decade. Another 2022 survey by Afrobarometer revealed that a staggering 87% of Zimbabweans believe corruption has increased or stayed the same.
A path forward
Zimbabwe’s economy is facing a confluence of challenges: inflation that won’t go away, higher interest rates and a sliding currency. The fallout has included a cost of living crisis, slowing business activity and fewer jobs. These problems are symptoms of deeply embedded structural weaknesses in the economy.
The following reforms are crucial for addressing these structural weaknesses:
Fiscal governance reforms to strengthen the budgetary process. This will enhance revenue collection and increase the efficiency of government spending. These reforms should also aim to boost revenue collection by lowering pervasive informality in the economy.
Central bank governance reforms to promote autonomy of the bank’s operations, including monetary policy independence which is important for preserving price stability.
In addition, good fiscal governance positively affects central bank governance by reducing the need for central bank financing, which allows a reduction in inflation.","Zimbabwe heads to the polls amid high inflation, a slumping currency and a cost of living crisis",business + economy
"The former chief executive of South Africa’s power utility, Eskom, has written a scathing critique of the ruling party’s practices that have seriously damaged the country’s economy.
Andre de Ruyter’s book Truth to Power is not the first exposé of the country’s political and economic woes under the African National Congress. But it strikes a sensitive chord because of the impact of recurring power cuts on the economy and daily life, a crisis De Ruyter was hired to deal with.
Beyond his description of Eskom’s corruption and ineptitude is a subtler message that is equally disturbing. It’s De Ruyter’s prescription to end the state’s involvement in the economy, which he sees as a major obstacle to economic growth. In its place, he advocates a socially unhinged liberalisation of the economy (p231) in which the market is left to its devices. He observes that:
Wherever governments have allocated resources, it has been an abysmal failure.
What De Ruyter fails to grasp, though, is that what he advocates has been a core part of the ANC’s policies for over 25 years.
My view, based on 30 years of research, writing and teaching the political economy of Africa, is that this would roll back whatever gains have been realised so far in redressing the segregated economy of colonial and apartheid eras. His version of neo-liberalism or unfettered market ideology and policy that emphasises the value of open markets with minimalist state regulations would worsen people’s living conditions.
My current research focuses on the relationship between democracy and development. States can and sometimes do use public policy to – in the words of the late American political economist and scholar Alice H. Amsden – “govern the market”. Botswana’s post-colonial experience, discussed in my 1999 book, is most relevant to South Africa. At independence in 1966, Botswana had little infrastructure and few opportunities. But thanks to its first two presidents, Botswana has achieved a middle income country status as it has grown significantly for the past 50 years.
If the government of South Africa made good use of the state in governing and disciplining the market, it is highly likely that unemployment in the country would not be what it is today. Similarly, if the government of independent Botswana had followed De Ruyter’s prescription, the country would likely have become another basket case.
What South Africa needs is not neo-liberalism, but a new social contract between government, labour and business to create productive jobs and redress social injustices. Such a contract would include concrete milestones on targeted investments in productive sectors. It would demand that labour militancy and disruption meanwhile be kept at the minimum.
De Ruyter’s key claims
De Ruyter identifies four of the major causes of the country’s energy crisis.
First is the deployment of ANC party activists, or cadres, in state-owned enterprises. Many were not only ill-equipped for their jobs but sought to profit from their assignments through irregularities. This created criminal networks that destroyed some national enterprises.
Second is a coalition of actors he calls the “coal mafia” in control of coal supply to Eskom. They exported high quality coal and supplied low grade coal to Eskom. This led to regular collapses of Eskom’s power stations.
Third, he accuses the Minster of Minerals and Energy, Gwede Mantashe, a former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, of blocking the transition to green energy.
Read more: Corruption in South Africa: former CEO's explosive book exposes how state power utility was destroyed
Fourth, De Ruyter claims the ANC government failed to retain experienced white engineers. The young white and black engineering graduates may be well trained but lack hands-on experience. Eskom was therefore left with a shortage of experienced engineers at a time when it needed them the most.
What is clear from both De Ruyter’s account and the findings of the Zondo Commission into state capture is that the ANC leadership, particularly in the last two decades, sanctioned the abuse of public authority. In fact, some of the leaders flouted the ethical principles of the ANC itself by joining the ultra wealthy as inequality in the country deepened.
Neo-liberalism will not deliver
De Ruyter’s prescribed remedies amount to the repackaging of economic apartheid. The beneficiaries of racist policies and the ANC’s neo-liberalism would be put on steroids. His remedies are based on the policies the World Bank imposed on the rest of Africa in 1981, policies that devastated the continent.
He also blindly condemns the role of government in development (p112) and advocates the privatisation of the energy sector, knowing well that the white business establishment would be the biggest beneficiary of such reforms.
De Ruyter’s dismissal of the role of an activist state in the economy – one that governs the market– ignores the positive economic role of governments in such countries as South Korea, Taiwan and Japan.
Then there is his view about the basic income grant for the poor, a policy which he says will entrench dependency on the state even further (p115).
He forgets that past segregationist policies gave nearly 87% of the land to white South Africans and heavily subsidised their education. They also subjected black workers to white exploitation, laying the foundations of the income and wealth inequality that persists today between whites and blacks.
What went wrong with the ANC government?
Regardless of the weaknesses in De Ruyter’s contentions, the South African government’s record during the past two decades has been dreadful. One of the most precious assets the ANC brought into power in 1994 was the trust of the majority of citizens.
To preserve and reinforce this vital asset required a three-pronged strategy.
First, the state should have been more productively involved in the economy and efforts to eliminate corruption in order to improve social services for the poor majority.
The second task was to revitalise the economy by protecting and reforming old productive industries and investing in new enterprises.
Third, the ANC and its appointees should have been models of integrity in public service.
But successive ANC administrations, particularly since 2004, betrayed the trust of the majority in three ways.
First, the aspiring black elite’s rush to mimic the lifestyle of the former “master” clearly signalled that the liberation mindset essential for reconstruction and development was no longer fashionable.
Second, the government’s unrealistic belief that it could navigate the dominant neo-liberal global economic policies that laid to waste old industries such as textiles, thus preempting the possibility of a developmental state.
Third, the moral decline of the ANC leadership most cruelly exposed by the Marikana massacre and state capture underscored the party’s impotence.
Seeing beyond the nightmare
It is widely acknowledged that neo-liberal policies and corruption are companions in the contemporary developing world. Thus, what South Africa needs is not an extreme version of neo-liberalism, but a new social pact that creates productive jobs and achieves transformative social justice. Only then can South Africa hope for an African renaissance.",Eskom and South Africa’s energy crisis: De Ruyter book strikes a chord but falls flat on economic fixes,business + economy
"Nigerians doing their grocery shopping in July 2023 are paying 25% more for staple items than they did a year ago.
Nigeria’s inflation rate stands at about 22.79%, but the prices of staple food items like eggs, bread, evaporated milk, palm oil and plantain have risen by over 25% within the past year.
Using the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics monthly data on food prices, I estimate that a moderate-income family of four, consuming staple foods like egg, milk, bread, rice, beans, garri, beef, catfish, plantains and vegetable oil, spent about 64,000 naira (US$80) on food in May 2022.
By May of 2023, this family would have spent about 80,000 naira ($100), a 25% increase. Data compiled by the World Economic Forum show that the average Nigerian household spends about 56% of its income on food. That’s the highest in the world.
Three other African countries that spend a high percentage of income on food are Kenya (46.7%), Cameroon (45.6%) and Algeria (42.5%). In contrast, the US, UK, Canada and Australia spend 6.4%, 8.2%, 9.1% and 9.8%, respectively.
This big bite out of household income means that food price increases have a severe impact on Nigerians. An estimated 25 million people are facing hunger.
Nigeria’s situation is so dire that President Bola Tinubu has declared a state of emergency on food insecurity.
But will it work? My view as an economist is that fixing Nigeria’s food inflation goes beyond declaring a state of emergency. It requires a bold and well articulated strategy to transform agriculture and rural life.
Why emergency declaration is not enough
Parts of Tinubu’s emergency plan have been tried in the past. For example:
putting the National Security Council in charge of matters relating to food security and water availability
providing fertiliser and grain to farmers and households
creating synergies between the ministries of agriculture and water resources
establishing a National Commodity Board to stabilise food prices through food reserves and land banks.
Land banks are unused properties acquired and managed by the government. The goal is to use them for agricultural production, housing and other socially beneficial projects. Nigeria has an estimated 500,000 hectares of land banks.
But they won’t be useful to increase food production if the country’s young people aren’t interested in making a living through agriculture.
Most of the measures proposed by the president are short- to medium-term plans. They aren’t long-lasting solutions for the country’s food crisis.
Learnings from India
Nigeria could learn some lessons from other developing countries. One is India, which in the 1950s and 1960s experienced food shortages so severe that it became known as a “begging-bowl” nation.
By making food self-sufficiency its top economic and foreign policy priority in the 1960s, India jettisoned that image and became a major exporter of food.
India’s self-sufficiency in food production is the result of the Green Revolution initiated by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in the early 1960s.
Programmes under the Green Revolution included pro-agriculture economic policies, land reform and investment in rural infrastructure and agricultural technology.
Land reform: Land reform gave rural people access to agricultural land, supported by government-provided irrigation systems, rainwater catchments and extension officers.
A ceiling of 25 acres (10 hectares) was placed on land ownership per household. Absentee landowners with surplus land were forced to give up some land for redistribution.
Commercial agriculture is often suggested as the panacea for Nigeria’s food crisis. But India’s agriculture is dominated by small and medium farmers. These farmers value their farms more than their houses.
The lesson for Nigeria is simple: agricultural development is not just about giving farmers subsidised fertiliser and low-interest credit. It is also about institutional reform.
Transport network: Perhaps the greatest boost to food production in India was the inexpensive and extensive transport network in the country. Villages are connected to markets by paved roads and rail. State-owned buses are everywhere, even in the most isolated regions of the country.
Transport fares have been kept very low by competition from the ubiquitous “autos” (or three-wheelers) and rickshaws. Farmers can bring their products to the market daily.
Improved productivity: Rising agricultural productivity has benefited farmers and non-agricultural workers alike. Farmers’ incomes have been on the rise, while food prices have been kept low for workers in other sectors.
Higher rural incomes have spurred demand for manufactured goods. Factories have come to rural communities, generating employment.
The industrial and agricultural sectors complement each other. Indian farmers supply an abundance of inputs such as coffee beans, tea leaves, fruit, vegetables and leather products to the country’s agro-processing firms, including global corporations.
No quick fixes
There are no quick and easy fixes for Nigeria’s food crisis. India started its journey to food self-sufficiency in the 1960s, and it took a long time before its agricultural development strategy began to pay off.
The way to solve the food crisis in Nigeria is through sound economic policies that make agriculture attractive (particularly to the youth), as well as institutional reforms that protect land tenure, raise farmers’ productivity, boost supply, and lower prices to consumers, while also ensuring good returns for agricultural investment.
It is doubtful that the mere declaration of a national emergency, with a long wish-list, will succeed in ensuring food security in Nigeria.",Nigeria’s food insecurity: declaring a state of emergency isn’t a real solution - here’s what is,business + economy
"The South African Minister of Home Affairs, Aaron Motsoaledi, recently lost a court case that anyone could have anticipated was unwinnable. He probably expected to lose it too. He lost it on humanitarian and technical grounds. It prevents him from terminating the South African government’s concession to refugees from neighbouring Zimbabwe nearly fifteen years ago.
In April 2009, South Africa provided legalised shelter for Zimbabweans hit by economic and political crisis in their country across the Limpopo River. The Zimbabwe Dispensation Project was the first form of a policy to temporarily accommodate Zimbabwean refugees. It became the Zimbabwean Special permit in 2014 and after 2017 it was known as the Zimbabwe Exemption Permit. Zimbabweans who had arrived during the crisis period of 2008-09 had full freedoms, but no rights to citizenship even for their children, for as long as the permits allowed.
In 2021, Home Affairs decided to end the special dispensation after a period of grace lasting till the end of 2022 to allow Zimbabweans to regularize their circumstances. Some were expected to be able to obtain residence and work rights based on their skills and occupations, and others were to return to Zimbabwe. The number of people affected by the ruling is estimated at around 178 000 who remained on their ZE permits. Children born in South Africa were expected and allowed to obtain Zimbabwean citizenship and were not allowed South African citizenship.
178 000 is a relatively small number compared with the total number of immigrants in South Africa, estimated at 3.96 million by StatsSA. Many of the registered Zimbabweans are educated and skilled. Most have been successfully living in South Africa for 15 years. Why not simply regularize all the law-abiding Zimbabweans living under the permit?
Elsewhere in Africa and around the world  larger numbers of irregular migrants have been regularised. In South Africa, Mozambican refugees were regularized after the end of the Mozambican civil war. But the current anti-migrant sentiment in South Africa made such a course difficult for the Minister of Home Affairs. This is why he opposed a court action he pretty much knew he would lose.

I have been studying migration policy on the continent, including the African Union’s adoption of a protocol on the free movement of people in 2018 which I have argued could facilitate economic growth and the trade integration.
Migration policy in South Africa seems constantly in flux. Most of the immigration policy white paper passed by cabinet in 2017 has never been implemented. Policy documents and a law amendment on labour migration published a year and a half ago are still in limbo. A promised new white paper on immigration has not yet been published. Some of the proposals could have simplified migration rules such as a proposal to replace the critical skills list with a points system, while others such as the quota system proposed in the draft law would have added further complexities.
Will any reforms be implemented before the general election of 2024? Probably not. This is the fundamental problem. Immigration policy is so highly politicised that the government seems afraid to move. Our programme of research  seeks to show how South Africa could learn positive lessons on migration reform from other African countries and elsewhere.
Hostility to migration
While politicians frequently voice sentiments  hostile to migration and migrants, sensible policies in practice and on the table are shrouded in camouflage and occasionally sneaked through. One example is the corporate labour permit, another is the rising number of African countries with visa-free access to South Africa. Access to skilled employees needed from beyond our borders is being simplified. Reforms will be hidden behind a veil of hostility to foreigners.
This is hardly unique to South Africa. In the UK, while the government threatens to deport illegal migrants to Rwanda and stakes its fate on “stopping the boats” in deference to its political base, “long-term immigration … rose to 1.2 million for the year ending December 2022, an increase of 221,000 from the previous year”.
Similarly, Georgia Meloni who was elected Prime Minister of Italy at least in part for her anti-immigrant views, has set aside work permits for 425 000 non-EU migrants to immigrate into Italy up to 2025. Laura Boldrini, of the centre-left Democratic Party, said the high quotas were a surrender and
a bitter dose of reality for those who have built their political careers by demonising immigration as a national security threat.
A textbook on migration warns us, when it comes to migration policies, “not to equate political rhetoric with policy practice”. It is not surprising that in many countries migration policies seem confused or incomprehensible. Migration policy reform seems elusive in the context of such opacity.
And yet, effective African economic development depends on economic integration. Most countries are pretty small, especially economically, and effective integration entails the movement of persons across borders without excessive hindrances.

Not all African governments, even of richer countries, have been as hesitant as South Africa to reform migration policies. Members of both the East African Community and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have made greater progress than the regions at the southern and northern ends of the continent. Countries in Africa can learn not only from experiences in the EU or in South America, but also from other African countries and regions.
The New South Institute is running the Migration Governance Reform in Africa project, or MIGRA. The rationale and framework for the MIGRA project are set out in our new working paper .
We are studying migration policy and practice in four African countries, South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya and Nigeria, and in four regional organisations, SADC, the EAC, ECOWAS and the African Union. We believe that countries and regions in Africa can learn as much from each other as they can from experiences elsewhere. Papers on these eight cases will be published over the next year or so, as they are completed, and we will also be preparing other forms of media to engage in conversation with the wider public as well as with policymakers.
The work we have already done  shows us some exciting examples of reform on the African continent. In east and west Africa there are many ways to allow cross border migrants access for different periods and reasons. Even in southern Africa the recent agreement between Namibia and Botswana on travel by citizens of the two countries across their common border with identity documents alone shows what progress is possible. Visa-free travel is proliferating in Africa, as the recent bilateral agreement between South Africa and Kenya shows. There are many more examples.
Our project grows as much out of optimism about recent developments on migration governance around the African continent, as from the frustration and confusion about migration policy in many places. Perhaps it will make a small contribution to improving the practice, and maybe even the political rhetoric. And perhaps the South African cabinet will decide to grant the Zimbabwean exemption permit holders and their children the same kind of amnesty that was offered to 220 000 Mozambican refugees in December 1996.",Zimbabwean migrants: South Africa’s anti-immigrant sentiments are hindering policy reform,business + economy
"Professor Lovemore Mbigi, celebrated within the African management and psychology disciplines, died in Harare, Zimbabwe on 26 June 2023. He left a body of work that resonates on the continent.
Mbigi was over his career affiliated with several African and international universities. Notably, he contributed to the PhD programme at the National University of Science Technology in Zimbabwe. Academics have described him as an important African scholar whose work made an impact in management education.
In addition to his role in the academy, Mbigi was a consultant to business and an active contributor to how state-owned entities could be improved for better service delivery. His areas of expertise included strategy execution, transformation, leadership and diversity management.
I came to know Mbigi and his work when I was an aspiring organisational behaviour scholar. I observed through my reading of the literature that a lot of emphasis was placed on what would be termed western psychology. The influence of this western psychology would permeate through to consulting practice. In seeking a place where I belonged within my discipline, the work of Mbigi was a light in a dark tunnel. I appreciated him throughout my career phases and transitions, and have recommended his work as useful reading for the masters and PhD students I’ve supervised.
African concepts
Mbigi’s work challenged the dominance of “WEIRD” – western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic – nations in knowledge production and dissemination. He reminded us as Africans that we should never leave behind that which was distinctively ours in favour of what could be termed modernity.
Mbigi brought African concepts and cultural practices to the academic and consulting realm. For example he saw the African philosophy of ubuntu as a basis of effective human resources management. In ubuntu, the emphasis is on fostering a sense of togetherness and using this shared togetherness to achieve objectives. At the core the management of people in organisations needs to espouse these tenets of ubuntu in achieving a competitive advantage.

He also used concepts such as harambe from east Africa and nhimbe from southern Africa to inform talent management and organisational development practices. Both these “teamwork” practices in their contexts acknowledge the communal nature of African societies. Individual talent can be directed to solving community challenges through gathering together. Clear lines of authority exist around a goal but, importantly, there is a sense of togetherness in achieving this goal.
Read more: African philosophy needs to blossom. Being exclusionary won't help
Mbigi’s work has also been applied extensively to other fields of study, especially where people and the interaction of cultural systems are at play.
African management and leadership
Mbigi’s first book on African management, co-authored with Jenny Maree, was Ubuntu: The Spirit of African Transformation Management. In this work, value is placed on the role of African indigenous knowledge systems as cultural capital to assist managers within contemporary workplaces. Such knowledge systems, as viewed by Unesco, place value on the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings.
For Mbigi, turning to indigenous knowledge systems offered a perspective that could help address challenges faced in organisations. Such perspectives become useful in acknowledging diversity and using it for good.
His book The Spirit of African Leadership is an attempt to position the role of African leadership in the global arena, especially within modern management practice. Mbigi called for awareness of the reality that the African continent has a wealth of leadership knowledge. He emphasised that such leadership knowledge not only deserves equal attention globally: it has the potential to make a contribution universally, too.
Mbigi also wrote In Search of African Business Renaissance: An African Cultural Perspective, and Ubuntu: The African Dream in Management.
When I was an undergraduate student I encountered and drew on Mbigi’s work in two classes: organisational development and consulting psychology. In these classes, there was a need for theory and practice to be linked and balanced. I was impressed by Mbigi’s framing of cultural paradigms, especially those prevalent in African societies. I learned I could use such African cultural paradigms to inform not just my worldview but as a possible solution to individual and organisational challenges.

Mbigi’s books on African leadership and ubuntu continue to be cited in scholarly outputs. His work in some cases is even seen as seminal and pioneering. It has featured in training and consulting practice and is an inspiration for African scholars and practitioners to make an impact in a “WEIRD” world. One of his students described him aptly as “generous, energetic and humorous”. These were attributes Mbigi used to get his message across not only as a teacher but also as a researcher and consultant in a serious world.",Lovemore Mbigi will be remembered for his teaching on ubuntu in business leadership,education
"Rising international commodity prices can shape or reshape the fortunes of places. When large mining and oil and gas prospectors suddenly show an interest, a remote area can become a resource frontier – a place that’s far from the socioeconomic centre of a country but important to its economy.
High commodity prices throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s resulted in new regions of the world being explored for hydrocarbons. One of these areas was off the shore of southern Tanzania, in Mtwara.
Between 2010 and 2015, Mtwara went from a backward periphery to the forefront of Tanzania’s gas sector.
Mtwara is a region in the far south of Tanzania, on the border with Mozambique. Historically, it has been geographically isolated through poor infrastructure from the rest of Tanzania. The local population has felt overlooked by both colonial and postcolonial governments, with the southern regions historically performing more poorly than their northern counterparts.
My research in Mtwara explored people’s expectations in response to the extraction of natural gas, and how factors like commodity price cycles and mining life cycles influenced the political economy of development – in short, the way that politics and economics interact and affect each other.
It became clear during my research that the gas industry was expected to speed up development in Mtwara. The imagined future of Mtwara changed from moderate expectations to one of increased wealth and prosperity.
In effect, the creation of a resource frontier changed expectations of what development would bring for people on the frontier, and how quickly it would happen.
These expectations were not met. Natural gas prices fell from US$16 per million metric British thermal unit (MMBtu) in 2009 to US$4 MMBtu in 2017. Oil and gas companies mostly lost interest in Mtwara and related sectors collapsed.
Remnants of the expected boom, such as half-built hotels, higher food prices and a more reliable electricity supply, remain. But many of the jobs have gone.
This research adds to an understanding of how natural resources interact with development. In Mtwara, it was less the resources themselves that caused the boom, but rather the anticipation of a future gas boom. When it failed to materialise, the area suffered a very real bust. This possibility is something that resource-based development strategies need to take into account before major extraction even takes place.
The anticipation
In Mtwara in 2018, I interviewed a variety of people, ranging from local business leaders, politicians and community leaders to villagers and people who used to work in the supply sector to the gas industry, about how development had been influenced by the gas sector. Be it discussions around the 2013/14 pipeline protests (against the construction of a pipeline transporting gas from Mtwara to Dar es Salaam) or electricity infrastructure being built, it quickly became obvious that everybody, in one way or another, had a story to tell in relation to gas.
But the interviews made it obvious that two communities in particular were affected by the gas sector: local businesses, and people living closest to the onshore extraction sites, in an area called Mnazi Bay.
I found that people expected natural gas to cause an economic uplift, and it was this that prompted considerable investment in the region.
Investment focused on supply sectors. Mtwara lacked any internationally certified hotels, catering companies or other amenities for oil and gas staff. Real estate and construction also rode this wave of investment.
Politics also influenced this. The ruling party in Tanzania, CCM, harped on this promise during the 2010 general election. The party’s campaign slogan – “Mtwara will be the new Dubai!” – was repeated to me throughout my time in Mtwara.
Mtwara became a frontier for international and domestic capital. A future fuelled by hydrocarbon wealth seemed assured.
Alongside political promises, the communities of Mnazi Bay had the impression that the gas industry was already having a positive economic impact. Roads were being improved, electricity infrastructure was becoming more reliable and expanded, and people were getting jobs in supply sectors for natural gas. They expected this to continue, and to obtain compensation for land being used by the gas sector.
Within just a few years, Mtwara’s economic prospects and imagined future had been dramatically entwined with international gas prices.
The reality
But by 2015, the gas prices that had made Mtwara a resource frontier in the early 2010s had reversed. The sectors that had done well during the presumed boom were hit the hardest.
Hotels that were constructed to accommodate high paying oil and gas employees now had to change their business model and cater to lower-paid locals and seasonal cashew traders. Cashews were the bedrock of the local economy before the discovery of natural gas. A number of half-built hotels remain across the city, particularly along the coastline.
In my interviews, villagers close to the onshore extraction tended to discuss development going at a slower pace than during the “boom”. Sacrifices, such as giving land to gas infrastructure, did not result in increased development, and many jobs turned out to be temporary construction work that disappeared with the bust.
What’s more, the industry left environmental effects such as pollution and destruction of cash crops.
An unwritten social contract had been broken.
Perceptions of what gas could bring in the future changed. Gone was the belief that gas would accelerate development. The pace of development was seen to have returned to “normal”, meaning the pace before the discovery of gas.
The economic potential is still there, but the low global prices of the late 2010s ensured that the sector would not play a role in economic growth.
The changing energy landscape
Historically, Mtwara had been at the margins of the global economy, acting as a supplier of raw cashew nuts. With the discovery of natural gas, the region suddenly changed into an “energy frontier”, opening it to considerable investment from both domestic and international capital. Rapid changes in the energy landscape can create and recreate frontiers quickly, and change the lives of those who live in such frontier regions.
Since this research has taken place, there has been considerable change in the energy landscape. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed up gas prices, and European leaders have begun to see Africa as a potential source of natural gas. There is once again the “potential” to create Mtwara into a true resource frontier. But it remains to be seen if such rising prices recreate excitement on the ground.",Tanzania’s gas boom that never was – when local hopes are dashed by global realities,business + economy
"It is disheartening to see how many South Africans, including parliamentarians, have forgotten the simple and influential role the Land and Agricultural Development Bank (Land Bank) played in South African agriculture.
The former minister of agriculture, Derek Hanekom, summarised this role nicely in his foreword to the bank’s 1997 annual report:
The Land Bank was a conduit for cheap money for mortgage finance for farmers, for production finance to co-operatives, and for the liquidity of the marketing boards.
The Land Bank, established in 1912, had a narrow mandate for many decades. Its focus was on mortgages for white farmers to acquire farmland. It also provided wholesale finance to agricultural cooperatives and marketing boards who on-lend production (short-term) finance to individual farmers.
These loans were offered at below market rates. This was because the bank was well supported by the state through an initial capital endowment, annual parliamentary allocations and state guaranteed long-term debentures and bonds sold in the capital market.
Its funding model and its narrow mandate meant that, for decades, it was a stable institution. But critical mistakes have been made over the past 25 years that have compromised its critical role as a development finance institution in the agricultural sector.
Due to poor governance and wrong decisions in the early 2000s, Land Bank was virtually bankrupted and had to be resuscitated around 2008. Even after this, critical mistakes continued to be made. At the end of the 1997 financial year Land Bank had R1.7 billion (about US$368 million at an annual average exchange rate for that year) in reserves that was built up over many years from government capital endowments, annual appropriations and retained earnings. In today’s value it would be R6.5 billion (about US$346 million). It was all lost, either through irregular expenditure, or poor credit decisions and lending to activities outside the bank’s mandate.
The result has been that the bank no longer provides a service to the agricultural sector as a whole. This has compromised the success of land reform beneficiaries, aspiring black commercial farmers and the growth and food security outcomes of the agricultural sector at large.
Read more: Land reform in South Africa: 5 myths about farming debunked
We believe the problems can be solved and that the bank can play its role as a financier of land reform and provide the same preferential finance terms to aspirant black farmers as their white counterparts enjoyed between 1912 and 1996. Based on our experience in the sector, and drawing lessons from its early years of success, our proposed solution is simple: get back to basics.
There are two main parts to this. The first mistake that must be fixed is Land Bank’s funding model. It cannot be a “development finance institution” if the cost of funds is too high. Its funding sources need to be reorganised so that its cost of capital is reduced.
Secondly, the bank’s activities most be refocused to mortgage finance for land purchases and wholesale finance for production credit.
Funding
For most of its existence Land Bank was well supported by the state through an initial capital endowment, annual parliamentary allocations and state guaranteed long-term debentures and bonds sold in the capital market.
The table below depicts the bank’s long-term loan book in 1977-1980, expressed in 2022 values. The 1980 loan book of R26 billion was funded through R8 billion of government capital and Land Bank reserves (R3.4 billion), all at zero interest rates, with the balance obtained in the capital market at market-related interest rates.
With this mix of funds, its cost of capital was far below the prime rate. Even adding an interest margin to cover operational costs, the bank was able to on-lend to farmers below commercial prime lending rate and at very favourable terms (25-40-year mortgages, for example). This was not something the commercial banks could do.
In essence, Land Bank, in a true sense, fulfilled its development mandate – it provided affordable finance.
But critical mistakes were made after 1996. Some of these changes increased the costs of lending to agriculture. As a result the bank has been unable to achieve its development mandate.
The government decided in 1999 to cancel its capital allocation to Land Bank. As a result, the bank had to borrow the money, increasingly from the capital markets.
Since 2010 the bank’s main source of funds has been the money market, with maturity within one year. These funds are expensive. It is also impossible for farmers to start a business with interest rates above the prime lending rate.
New leadership also changed the nature of the Land Bank to be more commercially focused and to compete with commercial banks.
That same year, 1999, the bank changed its policy on interest rates. It had always charged farmers a simple interest rate. But it began calculating interest rate payments using a compound interest rate. This meant that interest was estimated monthly not annually.
The sudden change led to an increase in non-performing loans as arrears accumulated. The bank was taken to court since credit contract terms were changed unilaterally without informing farmers. The bank lost the court case.
The other big change involved Land Bank linking its lending rate to the prime rate. This had never been done before as the bank estimated its own interest rates irrespective of the decisions taken by the South African Reserve Bank.
Currently, all Land Bank’s pricing is linked to the commercial prime lending rate.
Other mistakes were made too. These included:
lending to non-agricultural activities such as property development, soccer teams and cotton gins, which depleted capital reserves
engaging in non-traditional transactions such as structured finance deals
reducing the number of offices in the country and the number of field staff to manage and assist clients
using intermediaries to manage short-term production loans, resulting in poor credit controls and massive losses for the bank.
What needs to be done
The bank’s cost of capital should be lower than the repo rate (rate at which the Reserve Bank lends to commercial banks). This implies that the source of funds should be reorganised. Here the state has an important role to play.
Read more: How to narrow the big divide between black and white farmers in South Africa
The bank’s balance sheet should consist of a mix of funds to ensure an appropriate funding cost that enables sustainable development finance. This could happen through a one-off parliamentary appropriation of R10 billion (about US$533 million). Then one can add annual funds from the agriculture department and the provinces earmarked for agricultural development and blended finance, contributions from retailers, food processors interested in growing the pool of commercial black farmers, and long-dated instruments in the capital market for the balance to get to a total book of R25 billion.
Lastly, the Land Bank book should be mainly focused on mortgage finance for land purchases and wholesale finance for production credit (but not via unfavourable service level agreements). It can thus become the financier of land reform.

"Somaliland’s main port, at the city of Berbera, accounted for two-thirds of the country’s revenues in 2020. Over the years, these revenues have mostly gone into the central state coffers, while the development of Berbera has been neglected.
When we visited the city for our research project on port infrastructure, international politics, and everyday life, this neglect was immediately visible. Buildings in the city centre were abandoned and dilapidated. Physical and social infrastructure – ranging from roads, water and electricity to health and schooling – were lacking.
Infrastructure development carries modernity’s promise of progress and development. But it relies on affordable and reliable energy. That is what is lacking for most of Somaliland’s residents. The electricity access rate is estimated at 15%. Eighty percent of the population use biomass fuel, mostly charcoal and firewood, to fulfil their daily energy needs.
The Somaliland government has mainly left the energy market to its own devices. Lack of regulation, and collaboration between the government and private businesses have spawned a monopoly of energy provision in Berbera. This in turn makes electricity unaffordable for most residents.
The uneven development of Berbera city manifests in the contrast between the large amounts of energy consumed by the port and the lack of affordable electricity for most urban dwellers. These inequalities challenge the expectation that Somaliland’s further integration into the globalised chains of production and consumption – through its modern port – will greatly benefit its citizens.
Berbera and other cities in Somaliland need policies that ensure energy becomes affordable for the urban poor. Without such policies, the gap between the rich and the poor is likely to widen further, with access to energy being but one of the indicators of this inequality.
Berbera port and development
The neglect of Berbera city stands in stark contrast to the modern technologies and equipment at its port. Since 2017 the port has been managed by the Dubai-based logistics giant DP World. The company brought in new transport technologies and modernised the port’s infrastructure to handle containerised trade.
A special economic zone has been established to attract investors. And a transport corridor that links the port with Ethiopia is nearly complete.
A DP World representative explained to us that the port had established its own energy source to meet the huge power demands of the new container terminal. Sudden energy cuts and blackouts would risk damaging the new technologies and undermine the port’s ability to become a global trade hub.
Somaliland’s government acknowledges the lack of reliable energy provision as a major constraint to development. The government plans to ensure that all citizens have access to affordable energy from local and renewable sources by 2030.
This goal is ambitious. Electricity across Somaliland is privatised and relies on fossil fuel, mainly diesel, which is imported from the Arabian peninsula. Energy is, therefore, costly and unsustainable. Somaliland has one of the world’s highest energy prices punctuated with frequent and often long-lasting power cuts.
So far, only limited investments have been made into the generation of clean energy, among them a solar mini grid in Berbera, funded by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development.
The privatisation of energy
Somaliland withdrew from Somalia in May 1991, after more than two years of civil war. When the country started to build its state apparatus, the private sector was already flourishing. The state relied, to a large extent, on financial support from private businesses. It therefore adopted a policy of minimal government involvement in the economy.
The energy sector, for example, started with private business people who initially used generators for their own consumption. The businesses eventually provided their neighbourhoods with excess energy. Some of these small scale, informal businesses grew into large enterprises which are providing thousands of customers with electricity today.
At least four major energy suppliers are competing for customers in Somaliland’s capital city, Hargeisa.
But in contrast, the market in Berbera is dominated by the Berbera Power House, a private company that has established a monopoly position in the city. With no competition, prices are up, and only the wealthy people can afford electricity in Berbera city.
Mini grid solar power plant
The concession for DP World was accompanied by expectations of closer cooperation between Somaliland and the United Arab Emirates. The Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, for example, provides financial and technical support for the transport corridor from Berbera to Ethiopia. It has also initiated social projects for the urban poor in Berbera, like building schools and providing green and affordable energy. It financed a 7MW solar power plant which was inaugurated in January 2021.
This was considered a significant step towards providing energy to poorer households and reducing Somaliland’s dependence on fossil fuels.
But immediately after the launch of the project, the Somaliland Ministry of Mines and Energy handed over the solar facility to Berbera Power House. The move further entrenched the company’s electricity monopoly in the city.
During the inauguration of the mini grid solar power plant, the finance minister proposed that electricity prices in Berbera would be reduced to US$0.1 per unit compared to US$0.6 per unit before the investment.
The interviews that we conducted with Berbera city residents in February and March 2023 revealed that electricity prices had not come down. We also found that the reliability of energy services had not improved.
It seems that the company lacks incentives and pressure from the government to improve its services and cut down energy prices. The company refused our requests for interviews.
Currently, a number of international organisations are exploring the potential for green energy in Somaliland and the wider Horn of Africa. These initiatives primarily aim to overcome environmental limits of the globally rising energy demand. Whether they will eventually benefit the population depend, among others, on how they are regulated and governed.

"Social enterprises are organisations that promote social or environmental issues as their core business. They are useful to societies in lots of ways. They can help solve social and economic problems such as poverty and joblessness, among others. They can also help support the work of local, provincial and national government.
Over the last decade a growing number of these enterprises have been started in many countries. South Africa has also seen an increase in social enterprises.
But running a social enterprise isn’t easy. They need to pursue a social motive while also trying to remain sustainable with little funding.
This often means that they need structures, processes and leadership acumen for both their operational success and sustainability.
Challenges faced by social enterprises
The performance and operation of social enterprises can be affected by a lack of resources. Their failure rate is therefore quite high.
So what could help them?
We conducted a study to try to answer this question. Our focus was on what capabilities needed to be in place for social enterprises to operate effectively.
Our research shows that for social enterprises to enhance their performance, network capability and strategic planning are key. Addressing these challenges can help their owners and managers respond to the challenges such enterprises face. At the core of this is addressing the challenge of funding and sustainability. Social enterprises rely mostly on donor funding.
Experiences on the ground
We conducted our study in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It’s one of the poorest regions in the country, with a high unemployment rate and continued social dependence. Industries on which the area’s economy depends are in decline.
Our research focused on 147 social enterprises in the area. One set of enterprises focused on poverty alleviation efforts. They ran empowerment projects for local communities, especially those in the black residential areas.
The social enterprises in the second group in our sample were dedicated to improving livelihoods of communities through agricultural support mechanisms.
Finally, a third group focused on assisting communities to respond to health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, the COVID-19 pandemic and tuberculosis.
Some of the questions we asked in our survey were about how each social enterprise made strategic decisions; the relationship between the social enterprise and its networks; and the enterprise’s continued value creation amid challenges. We then ran a model to see how these three issues related to performance.
The results showed that three important capabilities were needed to enhance social enterprise performance.
The first was strategic planning. This involves defining the enterprise’s direction in the short and long term, what it seeks to achieve in terms of goals and tactics, and how the enterprise will achieve all this.
Social enterprises need to be deliberate and intentional in setting up strategic planning regimes. They need a clear horizon, targets and mandates. These should then drive their day to day operation.
The second need was for strong networks. Building networks involves continued interaction between the social enterprise and its stakeholders. Networking capabilities allow the social enterprise to remain relevant to other important role players in the community.
Finally, our research points to the need for the social enterprise to keep a focus on its main business, the social aspect mandate of value co-creation. This continued quest for the social aspect necessitates continued involvement and relevance of the social enterprise to the community. Our finding on value co-creation – the social enterprise partnering with other stakeholders and community members to achieve its social goal – becomes important here.
Recommendations
We recommend that social enterprises be proactive in improving their internal processes and structures. This can be achieved through ongoing efforts to make improvements from the bottom up – meaning that the employees also drive the changes, not just the management. By being deliberate and intentional in their efforts, social enterprises can improve their operations and achieve better results.
We also recommend that financial and non-financial resources such as tangible assets (land, buildings, motor vehicles and equipment) and intangible assets (patents, goodwill and intellectual property) should be channelled to support strategic planning, networking capabilities and value co-creation. This means they should continue to be deliberate in searching for funding to be able to support their core activities.
Concerning non-financial resources, this includes investing in the training of the people running the social enterprise. Such non-financial investment strengthens the social enterprise through internal development of the three capabilities found in our research: emphasis on strategic planning, the building of strong networks and continued quest to create value together by all stakeholders.
The enterprise also needs clear channels for sharing essential information with stakeholders, including communities, towards achieving the social goal of the enterprise.
Formal networking structures should be established to enable the social enterprise to build, maintain and renew strong relationships with stakeholders.",Businesses that address social or environmental problems often struggle to survive: 3 things that can help them,business + economy
"A new European law that imposes the first ever carbon border tax in the world comes into force in October 2023. It will be applied gradually over the next three years before it is fully implemented.
A carbon tax is a type of levy imposed on greenhouse gas emissions. It is meant to encourage companies to adopt clean methods of production.
But firms could get around the tax by moving production units outside the EU to countries with less strict terms, such as those in Africa, and then exporting products back to the EU. That’s why the EU has come up with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.
At the moment it costs firms operating within the EU around €80 (US$86) to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide. Under the new system, importers will be charged the same for carbon emissions as domestic producers are.
The new policy will initially apply to iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, hydrogen and electricity generation.
But the mechanism has proved to be highly controversial.
In the global north it’s been applauded as a positive climate action. The policy’s architects see it as an opportunity for the EU to play a “leading role at the global level” on climate action. Climate activists in the global north are excited about it too, although a UN Conference on Trade and Development study concluded that emission reduction from the carbon border adjustment mechanism “represents only a small percentage of global CO₂ emissions”.
In the global south it’s been heavily criticised. Critics see it as an industry protection measure that will have negative repercussions on regions such as Africa.
The question being raised is whether such climate action is just.
In our newly released report, we point out that the affected sectors – cement, iron & steel, aluminium, fertilisers and electricity – are key drivers of African economies. We conclude that the new policy will wipe out 0.91% of the continent’s combined GDP (equivalent to a fall of US$25 billion at 2021 levels of GDP).
To put this in context, the annual losses from the border tax represent, in value, three times the development cooperation budget that the EU committed to Africa in 2021. In 2021 the EU allocated €6.3 billion (US$6.8 billion) to the continent.
We find that Africa would be the most affected region, as a share of GDP. This is because the EU represents a key market to many African economies exporting the products covered by the new law.
We conclude that the policy is a significant challenge for Africa. It will disproportionately affect African economies – big and small – even though the continent has a limited carbon footprint. But also we note that measures like this are here to stay: what’s needed from the EU side is a differentiated approach that can give breathing space for countries to adjust, combined with appropriate finance.
Difficult terrain
Our models show that the impact of the new measures could be mitigated if African countries diverted their exports to other markets, notably China and India.
But market diversification has been a challenge for most African economies.
Take the case of Mozambique. Our modelling found that the country is particularly exposed to the new law because of its aluminium exports to the EU while the value of its exports to China is almost negligible.
And there could be more trouble down the road. Reacting to the EU law, other countries which are possible markets for Africa have announced their intention to introduce similar mechanisms in a bid to decarbonise trade.
In March 2023, the UK opened consultations for its mechanism. In May 2023, India announced that it would retaliate by introducing a tariff system. The US introduced its own retaliatory measure through the Inflation Reduction Act.
Attempting to calm criticism, Brussels and some European capitals floated the idea of “recycling” revenue from the new policy to help African countries adjust. However, the EU also made a binding commitment to use the revenue for its own Innovation Fund. This will fund the development of new technologies in the bloc.
In any case, the anticipated revenue of €1 billion to be generated from the new policy is unlikely to compensate for the higher revenue loss of African countries.
Africa could arguably weather the impact of the law had it been in the process of scaling up renewable energy capacity. Yet, to date, the continent continues to attract a mere 2% of global investments in renewable energy. The climate finance that was promised is not forthcoming. Nor has the EU itself contributed its fair share to international climate finance.
A road map for responses
Countries will need to urgently reach new export agreements and unlock new markets for their exports to reduce the shock from the EU’s new carbon border law. This will be a tall order for which most countries aren’t prepared.
Access to other markets will also depend on the policy direction countries take as they respond to what is seen as a trade war and increased protectionism by the EU.
Considering the continent’s limited carbon footprint and limited challenge to the EU’s industrial base, what’s needed is a differentiated approach that allows countries to adjust, combined with appropriate finance.
Costing the pathway to transition in combination with required policy adjustments should form the basis of an African response. Measures such as these are here to stay. African countries should therefore consider a pathway for green industrialisation and garner support around that agenda through investments.

"It is easy to understand what African rulers see in the mercenary group Wagner. Its fighters can be deployed quickly. It brings sophisticated arms with it and can apply force speedily and ruthlessly.
Alternative sources of military muscle have flaws: United Nations missions lack robust mandates; African Union (AU) forces lack the arms and motivation; European Union interveners bear the legacy of colonial repression. The US has little interest in Africa beyond supporting fights against Salafi terrorists.
The Wagner Group was set up by Yevgeny Prigozhin in 2014 as a private military company to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine that year. For over a decade, Prigozhin could not operate without Russian president Vladimir Putin’s permission. During this period the interests of Russia and Wagner might have differed – but they did not compete and they heavily overlapped.
Of course, the Wagner rebellion that began on 23 June 2023 – after this article was first drafted – and then fizzled out makes Wagner’s future in Africa highly uncertain.
Since completing my dissertation on Soviet-American competition in Africa in 1992, I have followed the great power competition on the continent. This has included the slowly escalating Sino-American competition in Africa over the past 20 years. I was re-alerted to the “return” of Russia to Africa in preparing a textbook, Africa’s International Relations, published in 2018.
Based on this experience my view is that Wagner is likely to continue to bring misery to the African continent in multiple forms. No outsiders are likely to stop it. Its presence will continue also because individual African actors, state and non-state, benefit from its presence. Its utility to certain regimes helps explain the African Union’s conspicuous silence on the menace it poses. The passivity towards Wagner also reflects a deeper ambivalence about Russia and Russian imperialism.
Overall, Wagner has done nearly nothing to make life better for Africans: its activities have served to entrench dictators and undermine democracies; to extend and deepen civil conflicts; to murder innocent civilians; to exploit natural resources for Russia’s gain; and to vilify the only alternative that Africans have to China for investment.
This means that, in due course, the AU and responsible African governments are likely to resent Wagner’s presence and regret their failure to oppose it.
Wagnerian misdeeds
Wagner has helped abusive regimes maintain power on the continent.
It assisted Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir to train troops, guard resources and suppress dissent between 2017 and his overthrow in April 2019.
It has helped nascent dictatorships consolidate power. This has included its role in Mali where elections are being stalled and the military regime has invited Wagner forces in.
Wagner joined the civil war in Libya in October 2018, eventually sending in over 1,000 troops to assist the rebel leader Khalifa Hiftar’s Libyan Arab Armed Forces. This is Russia’s clearest violation of international law in deploying Wagner. Wagner’s use of mines and booby traps, which killed many civilians, also violated laws of war.
In the Central African Republic (CAR) Wagner has engaged in direct combat with a coalition of rebels. According to a leading research centre, 40% of combat engagements between December 2020 and July 2022 involved Wagner.
In Mozambique the government has hired Wagner to fight an al-Shabaab-linked group.
Russia and Wagner are involved in the civil war that broke out in Sudan in April this year.
Everywhere it goes, Wagner has been indifferent to human life, indiscriminately killing civilians as well as Islamic militants and other insurgents. The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project research group found that between 52% and 71% of Wagner’s uses of force in the CAR and Mali targeted civilians.
There are a number of reasons for this involvement.
Firstly, the Russian government has been on the lookout for military bases in Africa. Even before Wagner first got involved in Africa in 2017, Russia already had military cooperation agreements with 18 African countries. These have ranged from democracies like Ghana and Nigeria to ungoverned Eastern Libya, which has become a logistics hub for Russia as well as Wagner.
Secondly, Russia is using is redoubtable propaganda apparatus to spread misinformation about the US and Europe in Africa in support of the Ukraine war.
Thirdly, the motive is profit. Aside from the government payments it receives, Wagner has negotiated agreements for exclusive access to gold, diamonds and uranium resources in several places it operates in. These include the CAR, Mali and Sudan.
A vacuum of opposition
There appears little chance that any major forces from inside or outside Africa will seriously oppose its activities.
Individual African actors, state and non-state, benefit from its presence. This small number of beneficiaries will stymie action against Wagner’s mercenaryism, which is banned under international law.
Nor is there likely to be collective pressure under the umbrella of the AU. It can only organise collective action – as it did against apartheid – when there is a broad consensus on an issue.
The same analysis applies to Africa’s numerous regional economic communities. These have recently taken a larger role in security, but none has taken an anti-Wagner stance.
On top of this is the ambivalence of a number of African countries towards Russia. Twenty-four African states either abstained or were absent for the UN General Assembly Resolution that condemned Russia’s illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine.
Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Zambia all voted in favour.
What about Africa’s leading regional powers? Ethiopia and Nigeria are influential enough to matter. But each is too preoccupied with internal problems to take up the matter.
Only South Africa could take a stand against Wagner. But it won’t. The African National Congress, which rules South Africa, has a deep nostalgia for Soviet assistance during the apartheid days. South African elites also value both Russia and China as counterbalances to the perceived western dominance that they still loathe. And the country relishes the prestige that comes with membership in the BRICS group.
Nor is there likely to be any effective international mobilisation against Wagner. This is because western condemnation would go unheard or even backfire. As Joseph Sany, an esteemed peace-building expert at the US Institute of Peace, observed recently: “Western condemnation of immoral Russian violence and corruption” is tone deaf because it’s “tainted with hypocrisy by the west’s history in the continent.
The US, in any case, has few options to deter Wagner as American leaders are rarely focused on the continent. And France has increasingly withdrawn from Africa.
The only relevant external great power for Africa is China. But, in my view, China will play no role in constraining Wagner. For the time being, at least, the Ukraine War has made Russia and China allies. In addition, China has extensive business interests, particularly sourcing minerals from Francophone and Lusophone African states.
Lastly, China has been deploying its own private security companies on the continent, mainly to secure access to minerals. These organisations are not yet directly involved in politics, like Wagner, but their presence serves to legitimise further the use of private security companies.",Wagner group mercenaries in Africa: why there hasn’t been any effective opposition to drive them out,business + economy
"We live in tumultuous times. In the space of just a few years, we have witnessed a surge in populist politics across the world, a global pandemic, a spike in environmental disasters and a fraying of geopolitical relations demonstrated by the tragic war in Ukraine and escalating tensions over Taiwan.
That has all occurred against a backdrop of dramatic technological changes that are fundamentally altering the way we work and relate to one another.
Our future is in the balance. Cities will be central to our fate, for two reasons.
First, they are now home to over half of the global population, a share that will rise to two-thirds by 2050. That is something never before seen in human history, and means that the forces shaping life in cities now also shape our world as a whole.
Second, cities throughout history have been the engines of human progress. Cities are where solutions are found – but also where perils are amplified when we fail to act.
This article draws on a book I co-authored with Tom Lee-Devlin, Age of the City: Why our Future will be Won or Lost Together, which has just been published by Bloomsbury. As the book’s subtitle highlights, we need to ensure that we create more inclusive and sustainable cities if all our societies are to thrive.
Cities as seats of populist revolt
The great paradox of modern globalisation is that declining friction in the movement of people, goods and information has made where you live more important than ever. Appreciation of the complexity of globalisation has come a long way since the early 2000s, when American political commentator Thomas Friedman’s The World is Flat  and British academic Frances Cairncross’s The Death of Distance captured the public’s imagination.
We now know that, far from making the world flat, globalisation has made it spiky.
The growing concentration of wealth and power in major urban metropolises is toxifying our politics. The wave of populist politics engulfing many countries is often built on anger against cosmopolitan urban elites. This has been given expression through Brexit in Britain, and in support for anti-establishment politicians in the US, France, Italy, Sweden and other countries.
A common thread of all these populist movements is the notion that mainstream politicians, business leaders and media figures cocooned in big cities have let the rest of their countries down and lost interest in “left behind” places and people.
These populist revolts against dynamic cities are rooted in real grievances based on stagnating wages and soaring inequality.
A transformational effort to spread economic opportunity is long overdue. But undermining dynamic cities is not the way to do that. Cities like London, New York and Paris – and in the developing world Mumbai, Sao Paulo, Jakarta, Shanghai, Cairo, Johannesburg and Lagos – are engines of economic growth and job creation without which their respective national economies would be crippled.
What’s more, many of these cities continue to harbour profound inequalities of their own, driven by wildly unaffordable housing and broken education systems, among other things. They are also in a state of flux, thanks to the rise of remote working.
In places like San Francisco, offices and shops are suffering, municipal taxes are declining and businesses that depend on intense footfall – from barbers to buskers – are under threat. So too are public transport systems, many of which depend on mass commuting and are haemorrhaging cash.
All countries, therefore, are in dire need of a new urban agenda, grounded in an appreciation of the power of large cities – when designed properly – to not just drive economic activity and creativity, but also bring together people from many different walks of life, building social cohesion and combating loneliness.
But our focus must extend beyond the rich world. It is in developing countries where most of the growth in cities and the world’s population is taking place. Overcoming poverty, addressing the Sustainable Development Goals and addressing climate change, pandemics and other threats requires that we find solutions in cities around the world.
Dangers posed for cities in the developing world
Developing countries now account for most of the world’s city-dwellers, thanks to decades of dramatic urban growth.
In some cases, such as China, rapid urbanisation has been the result of a process of economic modernisation that has lifted large swathes of the population out of poverty.
In others, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, urbanisation and economic development have been disconnected, with rural deprivation and the flight from danger playing a greater role in the migration to cities than urban opportunity.
Either way, cities are now where the world’s poor are choosing to live. And many of their cities are giant and overcrowded, with residents too often living in appalling conditions.
Appreciating what is happening in the cities of the developing world is essential if poverty is to be overcome. It also is vital if we are to understand why contagious diseases are making a comeback. Modern pandemics, from HIV to COVID-19, have their origins in these cities.
Crowded conditions are coinciding with a number of other trends in poor countries, including rapid deforestation, intensive livestock farming and the consumption of bushmeat, to increase the risk of diseases transferring from animals to humans and gaining a foothold in the population.
From there, connectivity between the world’s cities, particularly via airports, makes them a catalyst for the global dissemination of deadly diseases. That means that dreadful living conditions in many developing world cities are not only a pressing humanitarian and development issue, but also a matter of global public health.
Tremendous progress has been made in the past two centuries in combating infectious diseases, but the tide is turning against us. Cities will be the principal battleground for the fight ahead.
Cities are also where humanity’s battle against climate change will be won or lost. Ocean rise, depletion of vital water resources and urban heatwaves risk making many cities uninhabitable. Coastal cities, which account for nearly all global urban growth, are particularly vulnerable.
While rich cities such as Miami, Dubai and Amsterdam are threatened, developing world cities such as Mumbai, Jakarta and Lagos are even more vulnerable due to the cost of developing sea walls, drainage systems and other protective measures.
At the same time, cities, which account for 70% of global emissions, will be at the heart of efforts to mitigate climate change. From encouraging public transport use and the adoption of electric vehicles to developing better systems for heating and waste management, there is much they need to do.
In 1987, Margaret Thatcher is reported to have declared: “There is no such thing as society”, only “individual men and women and families”. In fact, Homo sapiens is a social creature, and our collective prosperity depends on the strength of the bonds between us. If we are to survive the turmoil that lies ahead, we must rediscover our ability to act together. Since their emergence five millennia ago, cities have been central to that. We cannot afford to let them fail.

"Nigeria’s new Dangote petroleum refinery is Africa’s biggest – it will produce 650,000 barrels a day, giving it the potential to address the country’s energy supply crisis. First product from the refinery is expected to hit the market by the end of July 2023.
Owned by Nigerian industrialist and Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, the refinery is expected to boost domestic refining capacity, getting rid of the current consumption shortfall. It will also reduce import dependency and stimulate economic growth.
It is the first privately owned crude oil refinery in Nigeria. Nigeria’s existing refineries, plagued by operational inefficiencies under government control, have failed to meet the growing demand for petroleum products. Substantial imports have become necessary.
Nigeria currently imports more than 80% of its refined petroleum products. The country is the largest importer of refined petroleum products in Africa. Local production will therefore massively cut the country’s import bill.
According to the Central Bank of Nigeria, the cost (including freight) of petroleum products imports into Nigeria doubled over a five-year period from about US$8.4 billion in 2017 to US$16.2 billion (indicating an annual average of US$11.1 billion), before rising further to US$23.3 billion by end-2022.
The central bank says the average annual cost of petroleum products imports to Nigeria could reach US$30 billion  by 2027 if the country continues to rely on petroleum imports.
This money can now potentially be saved with Dangote refinery plugging the supply shortfall.
In my previous research, I have found that there is a link between Nigeria’s crude oil export dependency and its weak local refining capacity. This is also the case with Mexico, which exports its crude abroad for processing.
Based on my experience in the sector, I set out the four areas where the Dangote refinery is expected to make an impact on Nigeria’s petroleum sector and, by extension, the Nigerian economy.
Reduced oil import dependence
The most notable impact of Dangote refinery will be the increase in local refinery capacity, which will reduce imports.
Dangote refinery is expected to help Nigeria meet 100% of it’s refined petroleum product needs (gasoline, 72 million litres per day; diesel, 34 million litres per day; kerosene, 10 million litres per day and aviation jet, 2 million litres per day), with surplus products for the export market.
The refined petroleum output from the refinery in combination with other refineries in Nigeria is expected to meet the shortfall of the estimated daily consumption of 72 million litres of petrol.
The country has faced several fuel shortages in the past, which have caused prices to surge for transport and basic commodities.
Recent fuel shortages have been blamed on the Russia-Ukraine war. The price of imported fuel rose more than 100%. Importers operated at a loss due to price ceilings set by the government.
Besides eliminating import dependency, the Dangote refinery can potentially reduce Nigeria’s crude oil export dependency as more crude oil will be refined domestically.
Refining crude oil locally will enable the country pay for the refined product in naira which will save scarce foreign exchange and generate revenue in exported refined petroleum products.
The Central Bank of Nigeria says Dangote refinery could engender foreign exchange savings of between US$25 billion and US$30 billion annually for Nigeria.
Support for allied industries
The establishment of the refinery is also likely to help reduce the cost of production for industries that rely on petroleum products such as diesel to power their operations. In turn, this should increase their competitiveness in the global market while promoting local industry capabilities.
The refinery could also create an environment for allied industries to emerge in and around it. For instance, businesses in transport, housing and telecommunications will benefit from the construction and operations of the refinery.
And the refinery should create jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities.
While under construction, the refinery employed about 40,000 workers – 29,000 Nigerians and 11,000 foreigners.
The jobs were in engineering, construction, manufacturing and operations, among other areas.
In full operation, the refinery, according to media reports, is expected to create over 250,000 direct and indirect jobs. I believe this is a fair estimate.
The country’s current unemployment rate is expected to reach 40.6% in 2023.
Possible increase in carbon footprint
The operation of Dangote refinery raises concerns about its potential impact on Nigeria’s net zero emission goals. Net zero is an ideal state where the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced and greenhouse gas emissions taken out of the atmosphere is balanced.
Decarbonisation efforts are required for countries to achieve net zero but the path and time might differ as countries may want to take a gas-led approach to transition to renewable energy.
At the COP26 climate change meeting in 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari committed to net-zero emissions by 2060. This is to protect Nigeria’s environment and ecosystem from the impact of climate change and reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Nigeria has an Energy Transition Plan to get closer to a more sustainable economy. The plan assumes greater use of natural gas as a “transition fuel”.
Oil refineries contribute about 4% of the global carbon emissions.
The Dangote refinery complies with World Bank, US, European and Nigerian norms for emissions and effluents.
Conclusion
The Dangote refinery is a significant step towards self-sufficiency in Nigeria’s energy sector.
However, the refinery is still reliant on fossil fuels, and it is not a long term solution to Nigeria’s energy needs.
Nigeria has significant renewable energy potential, including solar and wind power.
Renewable energy can be harnessed to meet Nigeria’s energy needs in a sustainable manner. Therefore, Dangote refinery should be viewed as a stepping stone towards a transition to cleaner energy sources in the medium term.
It is essential that Nigeria continues to invest in renewable energy and explore ways to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to achieve its net zero emissions goal.",Dangote launches Africa’s biggest oil refinery - 4 ways it will affect Nigeria,business + economy
"Ghana’s informal urban markets play a key role in the country’s economy. They employ more than 80% of the people who work in the informal sector. They create livelihoods for traders, give urban residents access to essential household products, and add value to the culture of urban life.
Most market traders rely on credit from financial institutions, family and friends. Few have insurance. Without insurance, traders are left vulnerable to fire disasters, as urban markets are prone to fire outbreaks.
There are no statistics on the number of fires that have gutted markets in Ghana. That’s because the numbers fall under the Ghana National Fire Service’s classification of commercial fires. In 2022 there were 986 recorded commercial fires in Ghana.
Urban market fires in the informal sector have received relatively little attention from local governments compared to flood disasters. And research shows that local government authorities have failed to include fire risk in their urban management and development plans.
Our study showed that risk communication is an important part of fire disaster management. Providing adequate information on fire risks is crucial in disaster prevention and response. But effective fire risk communication requires that authorities engage regularly with communities. In this case, traders. It must do so in a way that draws on community knowledge and practices.
Risk communication in informal urban markets
We did our research in the Makola and Nima markets in Accra, Ghana’s capital city. The Makola market is large, having more than 35,000 traders and hawkers. It was established in 1924 and has grown in an unregulated way. The Nima market is much smaller but has also grown haphazardly in a slum area.
The selection of these two markets enabled us to compare and understand socio-cultural factors affecting fire risk communication.
We combined interviews and focus group discussions with market women, executives of traders’ unions, and officials of the Ghana National Fire Service, the National Disaster Management Organisation, and the Regional Coordinating Council.
One of our key findings was that informal traders lose trust in the authorities when they fail to keep the promises made after previous fire disasters. This leads to traders’ distrust of risk communication information and actions by authorities.
In addition, fire risk communication by the authorities has been ineffective because of limited engagement between traders and city authorities. Traders told us that a continuous relationship with officials of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly would have helped reduce market fires.
There was also the issue of language, which hampered effective fire risk communication. Some traders said that most radio discussions on fire risks and hazards were conducted in languages they did not understand. For instance, in the Nima market, which is dominated by traders from northern Ghana and neighbouring west African countries, the traders mentioned that fire risk communication was delivered by traders’ association executives mostly in English and other southern languages. Traders weren’t proficient in these. Obviously, being unable to understand a particular language affects the ability to comprehend a message.
Religious beliefs also contributed to the way traders perceived fire risk communication messages. Some traders attributed fire outbreaks to the wrath of God on some traders due to perceived corrupt trading activities or punishment for moral failures.
Top-down approach doesn’t work
Our research shows that top-down risk communication involving authorities has been ineffective in reducing disasters. Research shows that communication is most effective when it involves authorities and residents at risk or affected by disasters.
This allows for the development of communication strategies that are embedded in the cultures and environments of the communities.
Each community’s culture contains strategies and practices for dealing with disasters. Tapping into this makes risk communication more effective and builds social resilience. It shapes a community’s perception of risks.
Our findings point to issues which city authorities and disaster management institutions should consider when planning communication on fire risks in informal urban markets.
Firstly, they should incorporate traders’ circumstances in all communication plans. They should also work within each market’s existing social structures, including traders’ associations. Trust is crucial - so disaster management agencies must respond to the needs of traders and, most importantly, live up to their responsibilities and promises.
To be effective, fire risk communication strategies must not only be supported by formal institutions such as government agencies but also be rooted in and sensitive to each market’s socio-cultural dynamics and networks.

"Consumers are under a lot of financial strain. The World Economic Forum reports that the cost-of-living crisis is affecting people across the globe. With food and fuel prices rising, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep financially afloat. On top of that, salaries aren’t keeping up with inflation, making it more difficult to save and build wealth.
It’s during such times of economic difficulty and uncertainty that fraudsters lure unsuspecting consumers into “get-rich-quick” schemes, offering an avenue to make easy money by investing in a “lucrative” financial opportunity.
Nothing beats the prospect of making easy money, and every now and again there seems to be a “get-rich-quick” scheme circulating on WhatsApp or on social media that seems legitimate. But it’s not.
Our research interests centre on financial systems in emerging economies, and we advocate for financial inclusion and empowering marginalised communities through financial literacy and financial planning. We use our academic platform to share our expertise on finance, including common financial traps people should steer clear of.
“Get-rich-quick” schemes are one such trap. They’re also sometimes called ponzi or pyramid schemes. The schemes are a form of financial fraud. The people running them take money through deception: the misrepresentation of information and identity. They promise financial benefits that don’t exist.
You should avoid them because, more often than not, they are bogus and fraudulent business ventures.
There have been some massive fraud schemes over the past 30 years. In the early 1990s, MMM Global - one of the world’s largest and most notorious ponzi schemes - defrauded up to 40 million people, who lost an estimated $10 billion. Ponzi schemes have since resurfaced in different forms in South Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ghana and several other African countries.
There are five tell-tale signs of a “get-rich-quick” scheme. Watch out for them.
The five tell-tale signs
Firstly, they offer exaggerated and above-market returns within a short period of time, with the promise of little to no risk.
There are two golden rules when it comes to investing. The first is that it takes time to make money. Amassing a small fortune within a short space of time should raise questions about the scheme.
The second rule is: the higher the risk, the higher the return. In other words, no investment is risk free or can guarantee significant returns. There is always some risk involved. An investment that promises substantial returns tends to be quite risky, which repels most people with a low appetite for risk.
Secondly, new members are constantly recruited to join the scheme.
Typically, such schemes are sustained by relying on the investments of new members to pay existing members. Once the number of existing members exceeds new members, the scheme goes “belly-up”. At best you lose out on the returns you were promised. At worst you lose all the money you’ve invested.
When the scheme collapses, it is almost impossible to recover the money you’ve lost because you’ve technically given it to a stranger (remember, the definition of financial fraud encompasses the misrepresentation of identity).
Thirdly, there is urgency to join the scheme and no clarity on how the scheme works.
This is a classic characteristic of a “get-rich-quick” scheme. There is usually no clear answer about the nature of the scheme, what it invests in, how it generates its returns or the credentials of the organisation.
Legitimate investments are transparent and can provide investors with all the information they need to help them decide whether to invest. Unsurprisingly, a proper check of “get-rich-quick” schemes will unmask their fraudulent nature. This is why there’s always the urgency and coercion to make an immediate financial commitment under the guise of missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rich.
Fourthly, the scheme is not registered with or regulated by any recognised authority.
Regulatory authorities are important because they monitor the conduct of financial service providers and protect consumers by keeping their best interests in mind. The protection provided by financial regulators also instils confidence in financial systems.
“Get-rich-quick” schemes are not registered and operate outside the framework of regulatory bodies. This makes investors more vulnerable to loss and makes it more difficult to seek legal recourse when the loss occurs.
Legitimate investments in South Africa are offered by authorised financial service providers and regulated by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority. You can search for any authorised financial service provider on the authority’s website.
Fifthly, they use the testimonies from existing members who’ve earned big bucks to promote the scheme.
At the initial stages, the scheme tends to pay out to those who have invested early, and these members are encouraged to share the news of their wealth (which travels fast and far) to promote the scheme.
But this is a tactic used to create the impression that you too can earn returns in the double digits. These schemes are both unsustainable and unethical as one person gets wealthy through someone else being deceived.
Too good to be true
It’s worth repeating that if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
Wealth comes from a sound investment strategy and decisions made over time. Any promise to “get rich quick” should be treated with the cynicism it deserves. It will ultimately reveal its fraudulent nature. Recognising the signs of “get-rich-quick” schemes can save you from unnecessary financial distress.
It’s always a good idea to do your own investigation before committing your finances into any investment. You can find more information on the various types of scams through the South African Banking Risk Information Centre’s website and report them to the South African Fraud Prevention Service.","Get-rich-quick schemes, pyramids and ponzis: five signs you’re being scammed",business + economy
"South African higher education is plagued by inequalities due to the social and economic legacies of apartheid.
More than 50% of enrolment in higher education is from black, working-class, disadvantaged households from rural areas who depend on state-funded student aid. At the same time, some institutions of higher learning are also historically disadvantaged: they were designated for non-white students during the apartheid era. These institutions suffered discrimination, underfunding and limited resources, creating disparities in the country’s higher education system.
In a rapidly evolving digital era, one of the big questions is: can technology help narrow the gap in access to education?
During the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions had to use online modes for tutoring. Online tutoring continues to be useful in blended learning models (a combination of face-to-face and online learning). But there have been concerns that the cost of online methods might exclude students from historically marginalised population groups.
The University of the Western Cape, one of the historically disadvantaged universities in South Africa, has been experimenting with a free mobile phone messenger platform, known as Moya, to provide online peer tutoring for its large, undergraduate classes. Tutoring is defined as
people who are not professional teachers helping and supporting the learning of others in an interactive, purposeful and systematic way.
I am a scholar of information systems with a research focus on health and education. My research focuses on creating more inclusive online environments for students and patients, especially those with lower socioeconomic status.
Research on the use of mobile instant messaging has predominantly looked at small classes of fewer than 50 students. My study sought to examine the factors that influenced students’ engagement in the university’s large undergraduate classes. I wanted to establish which factors affected third-year Information Systems students’ use of a data-free instant messenger (Moya) for online peer tutoring, and what would improve their use of it.
My findings showed that the students preferred using WhatsApp – a mobile application that required them to buy data – over the one that was being offered that didn’t require data. Students believed that Moya was difficult to use and that effort was required. They said they did not know how to use Moya, despite the similarities in user interface to WhatsApp.
The results can’t be generalised to all South African tertiary institutions. Still, the key insights may be useful in other contexts where data-free mobile instant messengers are being considered.
What we found
Most of the students taking part in the study were full time (91.7%). They were predominantly young, aged between 18 and 42 (81.8%), and most used WiFi (50.8%) while 21.9% used prepaid mobile data.
Qualitative data was collected via an online survey asking three key questions: Which tool(s) did you not use in this course? Why did you not use the tools available? What would improve your use of that tool?
The study revealed several key factors that shaped students’ attitudes to and use of the data-free instant messenger for online peer tutoring.
Students did not see the need for or benefit of using a data-free instant messenger when they were already using WhatsApp.
Students’ perception of the application within their peer group influenced their decision to use it. An influencing factor was the lack of use by peers: “more people are on WhatsApp than Moya”.
Surprisingly, results showed that students had data and devices to use WhatsApp. As 50.8% of students had access to WiFi, they would be able to use an instant messenger requiring data, such as WhatsApp. A minority of students indicated that students had insufficient space to download the Moya application.
The fun or pleasure of using Moya was not evident.
Using WhatsApp was a habit and therefore was the preferred instant messenger.
We expected that cost would be a significant factor because Moya didn’t require data. In fact, students chose to purchase dedicated WhatsApp data bundles (which are less expensive than some other data) from mobile operators.
The low usage level of Moya instant messenger for online peer tutoring can also be attributed to student claims of a lack of awareness of the application.
However, in our other study where Moya was used to tutor a large class of 495 first-year Accounting students online, the outcomes were more positive. Most students (79.47%) indicated that the tutor was available and helpful. Tutors indicated that the use of voice notes assisted students in understanding course concepts. Students agreed or strongly agreed (70.2%) that the course allowed them to fully participate.
What could improve platform use
Students’ responses to the research question about improving the instant messaging varied. One recommendation (14.6% of responses) was that usage would improve if students did not have another medium, such as WhatsApp.
Usage would also improve if students did not have access to the internet or if they did not have data (10.5% of responses). A lack of access to the university’s virtual private network, which gives students internet access, would also encourage usage.
Other responses were that its use would improve if usage was compulsory and if they were provided with more information about Moya. Social influence would improve with an increased number of users, such as peers and tutors.
What’s next?
By addressing the identified challenges and building on the factors that encourage usage, educational institutions can harness technology to create a more equitable and enriching learning environment for all students. The insights move us closer to fulfilling the promise of inclusive education and empowering students for a brighter future.",A free messaging app seemed useful for disadvantaged South African students: why they didn’t agree,education
"When ChatGPT was released in November 2022, it sparked many conversations and moral panics. These centre on the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the information environment. People worry that AI chatbots can negatively affect the integrity of creative and academic work, especially since they can produce human-like texts and images.
ChatGPT is a generative AI model using machine learning. It creates human-like responses, having been trained to recognise patterns in data. While it appears the model is engaging in natural conversation, it references a vast amount of data and extracts features and patterns to generate coherent replies.
Higher education is one sector in which the rise of AI like ChatGPT has sparked concerns. Some of these relate to ethics and integrity in teaching, learning and knowledge production.
We’re a group of academics in the field of media and communication, teaching in South African universities. We wanted to understand how university students were using generative AI and AI-powered tools in their academic practices. We administered an online survey to undergraduate students at five South African universities: the University of Cape Town, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Stellenbosch University, Rhodes University, and the University of the Witwatersrand.
The results suggest that the moral panics around the use of generative AI are unwarranted. Students are not hyper-focused on ChatGPT. We found that students often use generative AI tools for engaged learning and that they have a critical and nuanced understanding of these tools.
What could be of greater concern from a teaching and learning perspective is that, second to using AI-powered tools for clarifying concepts, students are using them to generate ideas for assignments or essays or when they feel stuck on a specific topic.
Unpacking the data
The survey was completed by 1,471 students. Most spoke English as their home language, followed by isiXhosa and isiZulu. The majority were first-year students. Most respondents were registered in Humanities, followed by Science, Education and Commerce. While the survey is thus skewed towards first-year Humanities students, it provides useful indicative findings as educators explore new terrain.
We asked students whether they had used individual AI tools, listing some of the most popular tools across several categories. Our survey did not explore lecturers’ attitudes or policies towards AI tools. This will be probed in the next phase of our study, which will comprise focus groups with students and interviews with lecturers. Our study was not on ChatGPT specifically, though we did ask students about their use of this specific tool. We explored broad uses of AI-powered technologies to get a sense of how students use these tools, which tools they use, and where ChatGPT fits into these practices.
These were the key findings:
41% of respondents indicated that they primarily used a laptop for their academic work, followed by a smartphone (29.8%). Only 10.5% used a desktop computer and 6.6% used a tablet.
Students tended to use a range of other AI-powered tools over ChatGPT, including translation and referencing tools. With reference to the use of online writing assistants such as Quillbot, 46.5% of respondents indicated that they used such tools to improve their writing style for an assignment. 80.5% indicated that they had used Grammarly or similar tools to help them write in appropriate English.
Fewer than half of survey respondents (37.3%) said that they had used ChatGPT to answer an essay question.
Students acknowledged that AI-powered tools could lead to plagiarism or affect their learning. However, they also stated that they did not use these tools in problematic ways.

Respondents were overwhelmingly positive about the potential of digital and AI tools to make it easier for them to progress through university. They indicated that these tools could help to: clarify academic concepts; formulate ideas; structure essays; improve academic writing; save time; check spelling and grammar; clarify assignment instructions; find information or academic sources; summarise academic texts; guide students for whom English is not a native language to improve their academic writing; study for a test; paraphrase better; avoid plagiarism; and reference better.
Most students who viewed these tools as beneficial to the learning process used tools such as ChatGPT to clarify concepts related to their studies that they could not fully grasp or that they felt were not properly explained by lecturers.
Engaged learning
We were particularly interested to find that students often used generative AI tools for engaged learning. This is an educational approach in which students are accountable for their own learning. They actively create thinking and learning skills and strategies and formulate new ideas and understanding through conversations and collaborative work.
Read more: 'Please do not assume the worst of us': students know AI is here to stay and want unis to teach them how to use it
Through their use of AI tools, students can tailor content to address their specific strengths and weaknesses, to have a more engaged learning experience. AI tools can also be a sort of personalised online “tutor” with whom they have “conversations” to help them understand difficult concepts.
Concerns about how AI tools potentially undermine academic assessment and integrity are valid. However, those working in higher education must note the importance of factoring in students’ perspectives to work towards new pathways of assessment and learning.

"When health professionals collaborate rather than operating in silos, everyone benefits – patients, families and the health system at large. This is a fact supported by ample research evidence. The professionals reap the benefits, too: staff satisfaction and retention are improved through collaboration.
But in the real world, health professionals and departments often slip into silo mentalities. And silos in healthcare, as US cardiologist Laurence Sparling writes, are bad for healthcare. The “cure”, Sparling argues, is integrated healthcare with “cross-silo dialogue” – collaborative healthcare.
But collaboration is a skill that has to be taught. People don’t automatically know how to work in teams. Instead, they have to develop the competencies to do so. Where better to start than in the professional training they receive?
We are lecturers in the Interprofessional Education Unit at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa. For two years, we tracked the development of students doing the first-year interprofessional theoretical module called Primary Health Care.
As we explain in a recent paper, we tweaked the material dimension (the physical and virtual spaces in which learning and teaching occurs) to help students develop some of the core competencies needed for interprofessional work. These include communication with patients, families, community members and health team members; as well as teamwork competencies with all their complexities and demands.
There were immediate and marked improvements in students’ results. We also saw that students became better at giving each other constructive feedback and working together when needed. These are important skills to harness as they work towards becoming health professionals.
Changing things up
Information is available to modern students with the flick of a finger on the screen. This means the curriculum needs to be constantly evaluated to develop an appropriate learning environment.
One model of education shows that learning environments in the health professions are made up of two parts. There’s the psychosocial dimension, itself made up of three components: the personal, social, and organisational.
The material dimension is the second part and was the major focus of our changes. Starting in 2019, we introduced a few substantial changes to the way we taught and evaluated students. (Not knowing, of course, that in 2020 these sorts of adaptations would become necessary in a pandemic.)
Firstly, we converted the course’s traditional classroom test into an online test. Secondly, we introduced changes to the blog in which students had to post responses to a lecture. Students had previously reported that the topics were too rigid and that they therefore simply regurgitated what lecturers had presented.
Read more: Health professionals work in teams: their training should prepare them
Another change was to an assignment on how social issues are addressed by organisations in nearby communities. Usually, students had to visit those communities. But many had in the past expressed concern about the costs of travelling to communities – most relied on public transport – and their safety. They also struggled with the logistics of coordinating with team members from various departments.
So we instead invited community members into the classroom to share experiences and stories of their communities. Students were, of course, allowed and encouraged to pose questions to these community members. Students interacted with community members to gain insights into the local indigenous knowledge systems, which represent the unique knowledge passed down through generations within a society. This strengthened their use of polite language and clear communication in important interactions, both important for interprofessional communication.
Marked improvements
These innovations brought about immediate improvements in students’ results. At the end of 2019, following the changes from an in-classroom to an online test, the grade point average improved from 49.94% to 81.54%. While a more modest improvement, the average score for the blog went up by 4.53 percentage points. And finally, in the community assignment, the average grade point improved by nearly 12 percentage points.
A number of factors can be credited for these improvements. For instance, the use of storytelling, as in the meetings with community members, has long been thought to aid learning.
We received positive feedback from students. One said:
(This) is a very interesting module because you get to meet other students doing different courses and learn more about their courses, our lecturer made it fun and interesting too.
Another commented:
The course was interesting and it showed how the inter-sectoral collaboration helps society and the health of many patients.
Applying our lessons
Our advice to others lecturing in this field includes these points:
Help students to get comfortable with online environments. Incorporate technology into the first-year curriculum.
To enhance teamwork, give students the chance to critically and productively confront and reflect on their perspectives from early on in a health professions education programme.
Health professional educators must recognise the emergence of a new, digital paradigm in higher education. A comprehensive and integrated approach to education, research and community engagement is required as the healthcare industry transitions to an interprofessional model, pushing us to dismantle barriers and promote teamwork. Continually evaluating programmes to stay ahead of technological advancements helps prepare them for success.",Health professionals need to collaborate.

Title of course:
“News Writing and Reporting II: Multimedia”
What prompted the idea to use pool to teach journalism?
I wanted to break up the monotony of having students sit at their computers and write news stories or listen to me lecture. So I figured I’d change the venue and try something more kinetic.
I had been going to the TerpZone – a recreational area located in the basement of the student union at the University of Maryland in College Park, where I teach – to eat and use the Wi-Fi. As I watched students shoot pool, I thought: It would be cool to hold at least one class meeting here.
I also thought it would be beneficial. My rationale was that I knew there were some interesting parallels between shooting pool and news gathering. For instance, accurately reporting a complex story could be compared to making a tough shot.
Interestingly, the day I decided to convene class at the pool tables, our regular classroom was unavailable anyway due to a water main break on campus. So holding class at the pool tables in the TerpZone – which was not affected – ended up being quite fortuitous.
What materials did the lesson require?
I rented four pool tables for an hour or so. I have 14 students. Some students competed on two-player teams, so there would be up to four students per table.
We got the tables at half price, so it cost me $16.
For students who weren’t familiar with pool, I provided a link to a short instructional video to watch before class.
“The Importance Of Angles In Pool”
What does the pool lesson explore?
We explored the various ways that good journalism is like shooting pool. To do this, I had each student interview three classmates and ask each one for a journalism/pool analogy. The idea was to have students collect a variety of viewpoints, just as if they were out covering a story in the community, which they do often for this course.
What’s a critical lesson from the pool lesson?
Students reported that shooting pool gave them a visual way to understand what journalists do.
One student found it helpful for players to “step back and take a new look at the table before their turn” – a concept that easily applies to reporting a story.
“Finding the right angle for an article requires taking a fresh look at the facts and quotes,” the student wrote.
Another student said both journalism and shooting pool require patience. A different student touched on the benefits of remaining calm – whether as a journalist on deadline or when it’s time to sink the eight ball to win the game.
“Composure is key when it comes to both,” the student said. “I think there are high-pressure moments. Now you have one ball left, two balls left, and you gotta be able to keep your composure, perform under pressure.”
University of Maryland student Hayden Smith takes a shot at the pool tables in the TerpZone on campus. Harrison Rich
Other students noted how pool demonstrates the need to anticipate unforeseen consequences as they pursue stories.
“It was important to know where all the balls were on the table and how hitting one would affect the others,” the student said.
Why is this approach relevant now?
Americans’ trust in the media to report the news accurately and fairly is at a near record low – just 34%.
If pool – or any other game – can teach future journalists to be more thoughtful about how they pursue stories, perhaps it can lead to better coverage and help restore public confidence in what the media report.
There are other reasons why an approach like this makes sense at this particular time. Students are under a lot of academic stress, which can affect their overall well-being. As many pool players will tell you, shooting pool can be a positive way to relieve stress. It also can help build self-esteem and improve concentration.
Also, before we shot pool together, I rarely saw students socialize with one another so effortlessly. When we moved class to the pool hall, students socialized like never before. So it was a good team-building exercise. My only regret was not doing it sooner in the semester.",Searching for the right angle – students in this course shoot pool to learn about journalism,arts + culture
"The secretary-general of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors in Nigeria recently disclosed that only 38 women have been vice-chancellors of universities in Nigeria since 1960, out of more than 720 in total. The Conversation Africa asked Ekanem Braide, the Nigerian Academy of Science president and a former vice-chancellor, why this is so and how the country can have more women as university heads.
Why are there so few female vice-chancellors in Nigeria?
Only 5.27% of all Nigeria’s vice-chancellors since 1960 have been women.
Only 12 of the current serving vice-chancellors are women. There are 170 universities in Nigeria at present. So women make up 7.05% of the vice-chancellors.
The ratio is worse in many other countries in Africa.
There are a number of reasons for this state of affairs.
As in other professions, the early career years of young academics in universities coincide with marriage and having children. Most young female academics have to take care of young families, teach, conduct research, publish and generally struggle to climb the academic ladder. Becoming a vice-chancellor is usually not on their minds. At this stage they struggle to balance home and work life. School runs alone take up a significant portion of their time. In Nigeria, as in most African countries, these responsibilities continue to be borne almost exclusively by women.
When their children are old enough to take care of themselves, a few senior female academics aim at becoming head of department, dean, director and, in rare instances, deputy vice-chancellor. Very few have the courage to vie for the position of vice-chancellor and when they do, they have to face subtle but real gender related discrimination. Nobody voices negative attitudes towards women, but it is in the minds of all involved in the appointment process.
Discrimination against women and under-representation of women in leadership positions are deeply rooted in cultural beliefs, values, traditions and attitudes. Societal norms relegate women to the background as objects to be seen, admired, sometimes exploited, but not heard.
In my experience, the belief in male supremacy and female subordination remains dominant. Girls are regarded as inferior to boys and it is believed that boys are cut out to be strong and domineering while girls are cut out for marriage and procreation. Higher value is therefore attached to the boy over the girl even by highly educated men and women.
Women are constantly reminded of their low status and so in the end they become convinced of their unfitness and are afraid to exhibit “unfeminine” traits such as boldness, independence and ambition. The result is that women suffer from self-deprecation and lose confidence.
It is proven that women perform as well as men in leadership positions. It has also been established that gender diversity in leadership has a positive impact on performance and success.
In my view, as long as women, who form half of the world’s population, are not allowed to participate in nation building in Nigeria, optimum socioeconomic development will not be possible because only a part of the nation’s potential in human resources is being utilised. The same can be said about universities.
You have been a VC twice. How did that come about?
My situation is quite different. I did not apply for the position of vice-chancellor in both instances. In 2004, I was invited by Donald Duke, governor of Cross River State, to head the new Cross River University of Technology. I served as vice-chancellor from 2004 to 2009. I was again invited to serve as pioneer vice-chancellor of Federal University, Lafia and I served from 2011 to 2016. We were informed that government deliberately appointed people who had in the past successfully completed a tenure as vice-chancellor to serve in the new universities set up by government in 2011.
Similarly, my emergence as president elect and later president of the Academy of Science was smooth, with no need for campaigning and lobbying. The academy has a procedure that makes this possible.
What advice do you have for women wanting to be a VC in Nigeria?
Female academics who aspire to become vice-chancellors should:
set a personal goal and plan to achieve it
prepare a convincing plan for the university, making it clear what they want to achieve as vice-chancellor
serve well in any position so their name comes to mind
be confident
undergo leadership training
study and be conversant with all mandatory documents guiding operations in the university
be familiar with the roles of the National Universities Commission, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Federal Ministry of Education and other departments and agencies in the university system
apply and prepare adequately for the interview.
How can Nigeria have more female vice-chancellors?
It is a mindset issue. Men and women should just change their mindset about women. No quota. No tokenism. No more policies. Just act. There are many women who are qualified to serve as vice-chancellors in Nigeria.
Second, the government at national and state levels, as well as private proprietors, should consider and appoint women to lead universities.
Third, vice-chancellors, councils, senates, and staff of universities should identify and overcome obstacles to women’s entry into leadership positions in the university. Most universities have centres of gender studies. These centres should work harder at conducting regular mentorship programmes for women, providing leadership training for all women who need it and advising university management on how to assist young female academics by providing a conducive work environment.","Nigeria’s women vice-chancellors: I know what it’s like to be one, and why there are so few",education
"Literacy changes lives: in Unesco’s words, it “empowers and liberates people, … reduces poverty, increases participation in the labour market and has positive effects on health and sustainable development”.
But in South Africa, 8 out of 10 children cannot read for meaning by the end of their third school year.
During the first three years of their education, South African children receive schooling in one of the 11 written official languages. Generally, this means being taught in their home language.
Then, at the beginning of grade 4 – when most learners are about 10 years old – English becomes the language of instruction. Learners are expected to be literate in both English and their home language by this time. In reality, they are not literate in any language.
The problem is partly caused by the fact that South Africa is, in many respects, a resource-scarce country, especially as it concerns indigenous languages. Even a language such as isiZulu, with 15 million home language speakers, has a dearth of language education resources. The situation is even worse for smaller languages, such as isiNdebele, with just over 1 million home language speakers.
In such an environment, where it’s not easy to acquire literacy, the innovative and creative use of technology offers new ways of tackling this strategic challenge. This is what our Ngiyaqonda! project aims to do. “Ngiyaqonda” is an isiZulu word which means “I understand”.
The project centres on a mobile application to support literacy development. The app’s goal is to provide a rich digital environment, involving speech and text technology, in which learners build grammatically correct sentences based on audio prompts generated via synthetic voice technology – a first for isiZulu.
The initial focus is on the learner’s home language (it’s currently being piloted with grade 3 isiZulu-speaking learners at a school in Soweto, Johannesburg). English is introduced gradually as a target language. The language and speech technology has been developed to provide linguistic accuracy and is grounded in teaching principles.
Large language models
Technology, especially the employment of language technology in the education domain, is not a silver bullet. Its use must be carefully considered. This means having a clear idea of the expectations and limitations of possible solutions. In other words, what factors should be considered when using technology in support of literacy development for young children?

A multimodal approach is an obvious starting point: children can talk long before they can read and write. Employing speech technology along with text technology helps to bridge the gap from oral competency in a language to written competency. Grammatical correctness and the appropriate use of suitable vocabulary are essential, too.
ChatGPT has changed popular perceptions of what is possible in modelling languages using computers. The program uses large language models, which predict how words occur together in a language. This requires massive amounts of data. But there’s a problem when dealing with a resource-scarce language like isiZulu: there simply isn’t enough data available to train a model that is reliable enough to meet the requirements we’ve mentioned. And isiZulu’s linguistic characteristics, like the complex internal structure of its words, could severely affect the grammatical accuracy of such models if trained on insufficient data.
Computational grammars
That’s where computational grammars come in. These are structured sets of rules that describe how words occur in a language. Instead of making predictions based on previously seen data, computational grammars model the grammar of the language in a more direct way, allowing a larger degree of control over accuracy.
Our approach involves the use of such grammars for isiZulu and English and covers both languages’ major linguistic structures, as well as curriculum-based vocabulary. They have been designed to generate thousands of grammatically correct sentences that meet the teaching and learning requirements of repetition and novelty.

These sentences function as the language content of the speech-enabled mobile application. The application uses synthetic voice technology (also known as text-to-speech) to read aloud the automatically generated sentences in either isiZulu or English. The computational grammars act as a predictive text engine that allows users to recreate the prompt sentences word by word. An area of the screen is dedicated to displaying words as options for building the sentence. Users can select words by dragging them into the sentence itself; with each correct selection, new options are generated.
Lessons
In the earlier lessons, the application focuses on the task of decoding. This is a mental process and an essential component of reading in which sequences of letters must be associated with their corresponding sounds to form words. At this stage, lessons are monolingual.
For example, in the first lesson, a learner might encounter the sentence
UVusi ufuna isikhindi ediloweni (Vusi searches for his pants in the drawer).
This would be read aloud by the text-to-speech in isiZulu. The learner must fit the words they see to the sounds they hear.
Later lessons are multilingual and focus at the same time on reading for meaning and learning a target language. For most learners, the target language is English. Learners listen to sentences in one language and must reproduce a translation textually.
The app currently includes nine lessons. We plan to significantly expand this soon.
Pilot project
The purpose of the pilot study is to establish whether the app makes a measurable difference in learners’ ability to read and compose sentences. It is used during scheduled reading periods and is meant to complement the educator’s existing teaching approach.

"Distance education first appeared in the United States in the 1800s. At the time, students received the relevant material through the post and then returned it to the institution.
Scholars in the field say that distance education is now in its “fifth generation”. This means that, like so much else in the world, knowledge is delivered via the internet. Students want to be able to access learning materials at a time and place that’s convenient to them. Flexibility is key.
The increasingly important role of multimedia in higher education was emphasised during the COVID pandemic. Universities that previously held in-person classes switched to digital, remote learning. Even though open distance universities were hypothetically better equipped for the switch, since their model meant they already used technology and digital tools, many were more comfortable with a blended learning approach (some in-person teaching and some remote teaching).
It is now nearly four years since COVID was declared a global pandemic. Much of society, and much of higher education, has returned to “normal”.
But it’s important that higher education institutions don’t waste the lessons learned during the height of the pandemic about the powerful role that multimedia can play in learning and teaching. This is especially the case for open distance education since it offers a way to improve access to higher education for people from diverse societies and backgrounds.
So, for my PhD in education, I set out to develop a post-pandemic multimedia framework for teaching and learning in open distance institutions in South Africa.
The study identified a number of challenges that might keep the country’s open distance institutions from adopting such a framework. One is insufficient access by both students and institutions, though mostly students, to information and communication technology infrastructure such as capable networks, cloud infrastructure, and the relevant hardware and software tools.
Institutions also need to regularly update their software and ensure that their staff are constantly learning new skills as technologies change. Crucially, institutional websites must be zero-rated – service providers should not charge for access and use of specific internet pages. It also emerged from my research that lecturers found WhatsApp to be a powerful tool for learning and teaching.
The study
The majority of students in the country’s higher education institutions are enrolled through the contact mode. But 370,891 (34.5% of all students) are pursuing their education through distance learning.
To conduct the study, I engaged with 15 participants from three selected support departments (four deans, eight lecturers from four selected colleges, and three support staff participants) at an open distance higher learning institution in South Africa.
Read more: Remote teaching in Nigeria and South Africa got a COVID wake-up call -- how to capitalise on it
I handed out questionnaires and conducted interviews with these participants. I wanted to know what their skill levels were regarding multimedia technologies and how they used those technologies during the pandemic. I also analysed relevant institutional documents.
One participant emphasised that not only were multimedia solutions made available to staff, but academics were trained to use these. The institution’s multimedia centre, they said, also equipped some staff with “audiovisual tools of the trade such as podcast equipment”.
Several participants emphasised how valuable WhatsApp had been as a platform, particularly for “fast communication” with students. It was also, they said, a good way to build relationships with students. One told me that Facebook was their go-to platform for general communication but that “for module-related content, WhatsApp was the main platform we used”.
What comes next
Based on the results of my study, I propose that collaborative leadership is needed to ensure there are proper frameworks for multimedia as teaching and learning tools at open distance institutions. This can serve as a guide to institutions for incorporating multimedia; it helps to organise the structuring of video content, audio, graphics and text in a manner that enhances teaching.
The South African government (particularly the department of higher education and training), individual researchers, educational institutions and the private sector all have a role to play.
Read more: Online teaching and learning is not just for pandemics and it can help solve old problems
The government, for instance, should recruit and engage mobile network service providers to install fibre and internet connectivity, even in the country’s rural areas. This will broaden access. Integrating solar systems into electricity supply, especially but not limited to these areas, is also important.
Watching and downloading videos requires a great deal of data. So, zero-rating all websites related to education is another way to create access. In this way students can access all the resources they need, not just static, text-based modules.",Multimedia is key to distance education: I built a model South African universities can use,education
"Uncommon Courses is an occasional series from The Conversation U.S. highlighting unconventional approaches to teaching.
Title of course:
Alcohol in American Literature
What prompted the idea for the course?
I got the idea for the course when I was writing a chapter on the temperance movement in American literature for my doctoral dissertation. I ended up reading a lot of fiction and poetry about alcohol and the anti-alcohol movement. I thought it would be fun to teach a class that surveyed American literature through a booze-themed lens.
Since alcohol affects and disables people regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity or class, it is easy to find literature about the impact of alcohol from many points of view.
What does the course explore?
I pair my course with a medical doctor who teaches a course on the biology of addiction. In the biology course, students learn about the biological and physiological effects of diseases of addiction, substance use and abuse, dependency and recovery.
The core curriculum at John Carroll University requires students to take paired courses from different departments that are linked together. A colleague who teaches biology courses approached me about linking my alcohol class to her addiction class. Students must take both of our courses during the same semester. The combined courses give students both a scientific and literary view of addiction.
Students read fiction, poetry and drama about many aspects of alcohol and other addictive substances: celebrating them, struggling with them, even prohibiting and regulating them. Students compare the literary representations of substance and alcohol abuse with medical descriptions and impacts. For example, when my class reads Kristen Roupenian’s viral short story “Cat Person,” we talk about the role of alcohol in reducing inhibition when casually dating.
What’s a critical lesson from the course?
My goal is for students to come to a better understanding of how alcohol influences literature. They learn how some writers portray the way alcoholism further marginalizes minorities. For example, characters in Sherman Alexie’s “The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven” are enrolled members of the Spokane Tribe of Indians. They live on the reservation and have great difficulty finding or keeping a job. Many characters suffer from intergenerational trauma, poverty and a pervasive addiction to alcohol.
For their final project, students must pitch a movie that offers a compelling plot with relatable characters. The storyline must be backed up by a deep understanding of the science of disease and addiction.
What materials does the course feature?
• “Night of the Living Rez,” by Morgan Talty, explores addiction and poverty among the Penobscot Nation.
• “The Sun Also Rises,” by Ernest Hemingway, is a classic novel set in 1920s Paris about a set of heavy-drinking American ex-pats dealing with the trauma of World War I.
• We visit Karamu House, the U.S.’s oldest continuing African American theater, to watch a performance of “Clyde’s,” a popular play by Lynn Nottage that is set in a truck stop sandwich shop that employs the recently incarcerated.
What will the course prepare students to do?
Students can be better advocates for their own personal health, and the health of others, if they understand how addictive substances affect their minds and bodies. Pre-health students in particular get a general introduction to medical issues related to addiction and how American authors have long portrayed booze.
For example, Frances Watkins Harper’s “The Two Offers,” written in the 1850s, is believed to be the first short story ever published by an African American woman. It is a temperance story that encourages young women not to marry a drunkard, highlighting the antebellum Black community’s concerns about sobriety and domestic well-being, in addition to freedom.
The course hones students’ critical reading and writing skills while challenging them to think about the role of alcohol, substance abuse, sobriety and recovery in their lives and in American culture.","To better understand addiction, students in this course take a close look at liquor in literature",arts + culture
"World university rankings are released towards the end of each year. Institutions globally scramble to see how they have fared. Have they risen or fallen? If so, by how much and in which rankings? Have they maintained their position in an increasingly competitive global higher education landscape?
There have been some improvements in African universities’ performances. But the continent’s institutions still don’t feature prominently towards the top of the rankings. In the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2024, for instance, South Africa’s University of Cape Town is top for the continent, at 167th place. It is followed by three other South African institutions: Stellenbosch University and the University of the Witwatersrand, which sit between 301 and 350, and the University of Johannesburg between 401 and 500.
The first sub-Saharan non-South African institution, Ghana’s University of Cape Coast, is in the group 601-800. Uganda’s Makerere University, placed between 801 and 1,000, is the top in east Africa.
The value, methodologies and implications of world university rankings are much debated. Several institutions, such as the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, have even withdrawn their participation from some rankings. They are critical of the focus on competition and scores rather than on partnerships and open science.
We are especially interested in a recent addition to the rankings landscape: scoring for sustainability and positive societal impact. The THE Impact Rankings, for example, assess universities’ performance against the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The QS Sustainability ranking includes environmental and social impact dimensions.
As academics working in the field of social innovation and sustainable development, we welcome this attention to impact and sustainability. Sustainable development is a critical concern for universities globally. It drives institutions’ research and innovation. It matters to students. It is central in teaching and learning. It also underpins universities’ wider role and activities in communities, societies and economies.
Responding to the challenge of sustainable development is an especially pressing concern for African universities.
A mandate and a mission
African universities work in conditions of significant need. Many African economies have grown rapidly in recent times, but sustainable development challenges remain. These include poverty and inequalities in gender, health, education and opportunities. Conflict over resources and the effects of climate change are also major challenges.
Read more: Technology and sustainable development: a hamlet in rural South Africa shows how one can power the other
Some African universities were established with the task of addressing these challenges, and to drive development and prosperity.
So it is very welcome that several African universities place well in some of these new impact rankings. Some are even world leaders in addressing various SDGs.
For example, South Africa’s University of Johannesburg ranks 46th in the THE Impact Rankings 2023. It is first globally for its work to address SDG 1 (No Poverty). It has achieved this through initiatives like its Missing Middle Fund, which benefits over 60% of the university’s students. It also invests heavily in research centres, institutes and chairs that focus on poverty issues. It supports them to do research that has a direct impact on local communities and policy development.
Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), meanwhile, scores top for its contribution to SDG 4 (Quality Education). The institution’s students benefit from excellent teaching, complemented by investments in up-to-date infrastructure, ICT and e-learning resources. It provides numerous scholarships and runs programmes like Support One Needy Student with One Laptop.
Read more: Sustainable development goals are in reach if African universities work together
Another positive trend for African universities in impact rankings is that they are increasingly working together and with partners globally. For instance, Makerere University and the Bertha Centre for Social Innovation at the University of Cape Town are partners within the Social Innovation in Health Initiative. This aims to advance social innovation in health (SDG3 - Good Health and Wellbeing) across the continent and other low- and middle-income countries.
These positive stories and growing examples of African leadership are worth celebrating. And even more may be possible.
Filling the gaps
Further research is needed to understand how African universities are working towards sustainable development and what more they can do. This might reveal ways to enhance existing work and share best practice.
Universities can make it possible to find solutions to sustainable development challenges. They generate knowledge and can influence policy making and practice. They can develop innovative solutions themselves. As major employers, procurers, and resource users they can have positive (and negative) effects through their operations.
Research on the roles of universities in their communities, including and beyond teaching and research, has focused on the global north. Universities in the global south (and particularly those in Africa) have often been overlooked. This relatively limited attention may reflect wider inequalities in global knowledge production, and negative perceptions of the work African universities do.
We want to address these gaps. So we’ve launched a new international, multi-institution and interdisciplinary research project. “African universities as enablers of social innovation and sustainable development” is funded by the Worldwide Universities Network. It brings together academics from the universities of Cape Town, Sheffield, Ghana, Leeds, Pretoria and York, as well as Makerere University.
The project will run for the next 12 months. We will use a social innovation perspective to investigate how African universities are contributing to achieving the UN SDGs. We hope this project will build a community of scholars working on the topic in and outside Africa, and provide academic and practical insights.",Global university rankings now include social impact: African universities are off to a strong start,education
"Over the past three decades researchers have explored various aspects of the impact of the HIV pandemic. One focus area has been children who have lost their parents to AIDS. Less attention has been given to children who are raised by parents living with HIV. This group has become much bigger as more people have access to antiretroviral therapy and are therefore expected to raise their children.
Our research in Zimbabwe looked at the effects the HIV status of parents had on their children’s education.
In Zimbabwe, the current HIV prevalence rate among adults is about 13%. In 1997 it was at its peak at 29.3%. Nevertheless, Zimbabwe still has the sixth highest HIV rate in the world. Eswatini has the highest rate (19.58%) and South Africa ranks fourth (14.75%).
Our research focused on mothers in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city, who had access to treatment. We were interested in the impact of HIV on their investment in their children’s education. We conducted interviews at Mashambanzou Care Trust, a local non-profit organisation that provides care to about 5,000 HIV-positive low-income individuals in Harare. Thirteen HIV-positive mothers were interviewed to discuss the key reasons behind the disruption of their children’s schooling .
We found that the HIV status of low-income parents in Zimbabwe severely affected their children’s education, in four ways.
Firstly, HIV worsened the financial barriers parents faced when trying to get their children educated. Secondly, children missed school because they needed to take care of sick parents or siblings. Thirdly, sick parents were not involved with their children’s academic achievement because they were physically, mentally and emotionally incapable of helping. Lastly, children of HIV-positive mothers did not always have birth certificates, a major barrier to school and exam registration in Zimbabwe.
Financial barriers
The research showed that HIV in Zimbabwe is not only a health issue but also a socioeconomic problem that can force people into poverty traps.
HIV-positive women expressed the view that the Zimbabwean economy, their partner’s health and their own health affected how they supported their children’s educational needs.
We found children with parents who could not afford to pay school fees or buy school uniforms could be sent home until the payments were made. Other low income families experienced this too but parents with HIV could not work and so had more difficulty paying school fees.
HIV-affected families could also face the burden of raising other children from deceased or ill family members. Some of the mothers had siblings and close family members who had died of AIDS. In one case, a single HIV-positive mother  had three biological children and three orphans from relatives.
Missing school
Girls were particularly affected because they were expected to care for siblings, help sick parents with daily activities such as eating and toileting, and make sure they had a place to live and food to eat.
Mothers spoke about the heavy burden their daughters had to carry.
My eldest child was the one who took care of me and cooked for me. When I got sick, my daughter stopped going to school. She is the one who took the responsibility of taking care of me.
Some children were forced to drop out of school to earn an income.
He dropped out of school after finishing his Form 3. He is currently selling bananas at Mbare and the money he is getting is not enough. Most of the time he brings home some food after selling bananas.
No time to help
Most HIV-positive mothers told us that they did not spend time with their children because they spent a lot of time on income-generating activities, attending to their own health, or their husband’s health. These tough conditions led to even more illness and stress.
All my seven children stay at home as none of them is in school right now. Each day of their lives is difficult as in some cases we fail to get some food to eat. After having failed to get food for the family, it then stresses me more as the mother. Given my condition that I am HIV-positive I end up getting continuous headaches and sometimes I get sick as a result of the stress.
Birth certificates
Some HIV-positive parents were too sick to obtain birth certificates for their children. Without birth certificates, children risk being sent home and cannot benefit from programmes that target poor children. One mother told of trying to get birth certificates for her children in Mutare, almost 300 kilometres away from Harare.
I once went to Mutare to secure birth certificates for my children. I was told to bring my national identification card which was in Harare during that time. I am yet to go back to Mutare and collect birth certificates for my children. I am only being stopped from travelling because I am currently sick and receiving treatment.
Looking to the future
Our research highlights a vulnerable group of children who should also benefit from social assistance programmes that target HIV-affected orphans, given that their parents are too sick to care for them.
They should be included in the National Orphan Care Policy, which seeks to provide basic care and protection to orphans and vulnerable children, and the Basic Education Assistance Module, which pays school fees for this group of children.",HIV-positive parents in Zimbabwe struggle to manage their children’s education – study shows how,health + medicine
"Colonialism profoundly shaped modern universities in Africa. It implanted institutions on African soil that were largely replicas of European universities rather than organically African.
For historian and political theorist Achille Mbembe, one problem of universities in Africa “is that they are ‘Westernised”. He describes them as “local institutions of a dominant academic model based on a Eurocentric epistemic canon that attributes truth only to the Western way of knowledge production”. This model, he says, “disregards other epistemic traditions”.
My research is mainly on universities, especially on issues of equity, inclusion and transformation. In a recent chapter I grapple with what universities need to do to stop being inappropriate replicas of European universities. How can they become, instead, African universities that address African needs?
I conclude that, to fulfil their key purposes of sharing and creating knowledge, they must play five associated roles. These are: encouraging students to be critical thinkers; undertaking more than just Eurocentric research; engaging proactively with the societies in which they are located; using their research and teaching to tackle development problems; and, finally, promoting critical and democratic citizenship.
In all these roles, African universities must take “place” – the geography, history, social relations, economics and politics of their respective contexts – seriously. They must overcome Eurocentric theories of knowledge and western institutional cultures. In doing so they must advance both decolonial thought and the public good.
But the African university cannot be created through changing the intellectual lens and basis alone. Political action is key.
The importance of place
African universities must be shaped by their contexts. Professor Louise Vincent of Rhodes University in South Africa rightly argues that it “entails a deep engagement, both literally and theoretically, with the notion of ‘place’” for universities to find their purpose. Universities, she adds, are situated in “place”.
For Vincent, place is neither “objective nor neutral”. It is “inscribed with relations of power” and how “power works in and through places has to be confronted.”
This means that, rather than distancing themselves from the surrounding communities, universities need to, in Vincent’s words, “actively seek exposure and collaboration – because that is what they are ‘for’.” This has implications for universities’ functioning, roles and activities.

This notion of “place” sees knowledge as being context sensitive rather than decontextualised. Eurocentrics assume that the findings of research undertaken in Europe apply to countries and areas in Africa. This is not so. The continent’s universities must imaginatively theorise their own realities as a basis for changing them.
Five roles
African universities must play at least five key roles.
One is encouraging students, as anthropologist Arjun Appadurai puts it, to “develop their own intellectual and moral lives as independent individuals”.
A second role is to undertake different kinds of scholarship that serve different purposes, aims and objects. Scholarship must confront dominant Eurocentric knowledge systems and theories. African universities need to, in the words of postcolonial scholar Mahmood Mamdani,
theorise our own reality, and strike the right balance between the local and the global as we do so.
Third, they must engage proactively with the societies in which they operate. This engagement must happen at the intellectual and cultural levels. It is a crucial part of universities’ ability to contribute to developing a critical citizenry.
Read more: What happens when you put African philosophies at the centre of learning
A fourth role is actively engaging with the pressing development challenges. This is achieved through teaching and learning, research and community engagement.
Promoting critical and democratic citizenship is a fifth role. Africa requires not only capable professionals but also sensitive intellectuals and critical citizens. Universities must, in ethicist Martha Nussbaum’s terms, promote the “cultivation of humanity”.
Making it happen
The purposes and roles I’ve outlined here do not exhaust the meaning of an African university. Instead, they are its ideal core functions.
I also do not wish to imply that every purpose and role must be undertaken in identical ways by every university. There is no value in uniformity and homogeneity. It is essential that, within national systems, universities address different needs that span the local to the global.
But no matter their focus, African universities must, fundamentally, advance the “public good”. International higher education policy academic Mala Singh contends that this is the “foundational narrative and platform” for universities to pursue a different path from their current dubious trajectories.
The state has a major role to play. It must ably steer and supervise – not interfere with – universities. It must resource them properly, and uphold academic freedom and institutional autonomy. It must also ensure a supportive macro-economic, social and financial policy environment.
The African university will be realised neither overnight nor without political struggles that involve diverse actors within and beyond universities. It will entail confronting complicity, opposition, inertia and apprehension. Collective and individual intellectual and practical political actions, as well as “everyday acts of resurgence”, are required.",Colonialism shaped modern universities in Africa – how they can become truly African,education
"There is a huge amount of pressure on parents today – from feeding babies the “best organic purees” to making sure older children get all the developmental opportunities they could possibly need, while of course documenting the whole thing on Instagram.
There is also no shortage of advice about how to go about this. Just as there is no shortage of debate about the “best way” to parent your child.
But what if parents just focused on being a “good enough parent” instead? You do not have to be perfect in order to do a good job of raising a child. In fact, it may be better if you are not.
Read more: Most parents don't pick a parenting style. But that's why being a 'conscious parent' matters
What is ‘good enough parenting’?
We know parenting matters in a child’s life. Research tell us parents influence their child’s development, resilience and expectations of themselves and others. This in turn determines their behaviour and wellbeing.
“Good enough parenting” theory was developed by UK paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott in the 1950s.
He found children actually benefit from mothers who “fail” them in some ways.
This does not mean parents can neglect or minimise their role in making sure children are safe where they live, learn and play. Children also need to have their emotional needs met. They need to know they are loved and feel a sense of belonging.
But good enough parenting recognises parental failure is an inevitable part of life. Experiencing sadness, tears and anger are part of childhood and parents should allow children to gradually tolerate some frustration. The good enough parent realises it is not possible to be available and immediately responsive all of the time.
Parents will make mistakes – and this is OK. Ketut Subiyanto/ Pexels
What does it involve?
Winnicott noted when babies are very little, their needs are attended to almost immediately. If a baby cries, the parent will feed or change them.
But as the child grows, they do not necessarily have to have their needs met immediately. Parents can allow them to develop a tolerance for some uncertainty – or things not going the way they wanted – while still caring and responding to their basic needs.
This is important because life does not always go as we expect it to and children need to develop resilience.
What does good enough parenting look like everyday?
As a starting point, ask yourself “what does my child need from me?”
Good enough parenting focuses on tuning in to and responding to your child’s emotions and needs. These needs will change over time. For example, a good enough parent realises they need to respond quickly to their baby’s hunger cry. Whereas a teenager is learning to navigate life. A good enough parent will at times have to allow their child to face consequences of their choices.
At the same time, don’t try to “stop” emotions. Good enough parenting is about being there for your child if they are sad or angry, but not preventing them from being sad or angry in the first place. It can be helpful to think about suffering as not caused from emotional pain but from avoidance of uncomfortable emotions.
And don’t set unrealistic standards for your child. For example, if it’s dinner time and they are tired and hungry, don’t expect them to tidy their room.
Don’t suppress or ‘stop’ emotions if your child is upset. Instead, try to empathise with them. Yan Krukau/Pexels
Set boundaries
Being a good enough parent also means accepting your child for who they are. Children need unconditional love from a parental figure to develop a healthy sense of self. So, if you have a child who is more interested in soccer than maths (or vice versa) don’t try to change them.
At the same time, do set boundaries – such as “please don’t interrupt me when I’m talking” or “I’d like you to knock before you come into my room” – and try to be consistent about enforcing them. Not only does this help define your relationships (as a parent and child, not two friends), it also teaches your child about healthy boundaries in any relationship.
Things won’t always go to plan
As we know, things won’t always go as we want or expect. So if you feel angry with your child, model how to emotionally regulate and try to talk to them as calmly as you can. If you make a mistake – such as raising your voice or losing your temper – apologise.
But also find ways to give yourself a break. This means you will have the energy and capacity to parent tomorrow and into the future.
And ask for help when you need it. This could be from your partner, family or professionals, such as a GP, family counsellor or psychologist. Remember, this is about being good enough, not super human.

"If you’ve played Fortnite, you’ll probably know it as a battle royale game in which you fight it out with around 100 other players until there is only one left standing. And you might be surprised to hear the game has just launched a new experience for players: a Holocaust museum.
Called Voices of The Forgotten, the museum serves as a virtual educational experience enabling players to learn about the history of the Holocaust. Spread across two floors, the museum contains photographs and details of the Holocaust, events that occurred during it, and historical figures from the era with their stories documented for all to see.
The memorial was built by Luc Bernard, the British game developer behind The Light in the Darkness, about a family of Polish Jews in France during the Holocaust, and the unreleased Imagination is the Only Escape, an educational title aiming to teach children about the Holocaust. Bernard has long been a prominent advocate for Holocaust education, and the role of video games as a medium for this.
Bernard also uses his digital presence to advocate against antisemitism and Holocaust denial. In a tweet, he stated: “Yes, having a Holocaust museum within Fortnite is important. And yes, @EpicGames allowing us to build one will help us push back on extremism and hate that is rising worldwide.”
It might seem like an unusual decision for Epic Games to approve the addition of the museum, but it’s not the first time a Holocaust museum has appeared in a virtual space.
In 2008, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum created a virtual museum exhibit in Second Life (a virtual online world that allows its users to create their own content) called Witnessing History: Kristallnacht, the 1938 Pogroms. And earlier this year, a virtual scale model of Yad Vashem, the world Holocaust remembrance centre, was constructed in the computer game Minecraft. Now, with the addition of Fortnite, it is becoming clear that virtual environments are providing new opportunities to preserve history and educate on complex matters.
The limits of metaverse museums
In compliance with the Epic Games policy regarding no graphic or disturbing content in Fortnite islands, the museum doesn’t feature imagery of death or suffering. The photographs on display show people prior to the Holocaust – the lives they lived and who they once were.
Emotes (actions that can be used by players, such as dances and poses) and weapons – two of the hallmark features of Fortnite – are disabled in the museum. Although players may visit using the appearances of superheroes and anime characters, they are unable to play in this area. In the museum, the game begins to transition into its own metaverse – a virtual platform for users to create their own content and experiences for other players to explore.

Where Fortnite’s museum and other platforms’ exhibits differ from those in real-world museums lies within the constraints applied to each metaverse, and what the desired result is for their creators.
Some real-world museums, such as the Imperial War Museum in London, don’t shy away from showing the gruesome reality of the Holocaust, including imagery of concentration camps. Other museums avoid depicting this at all, and instead focus on the history of the Holocaust or its emotional aspects. For example, the Libeskind Building in Berlin’s Jewish Museum doesn’t include any imagery, and instead seeks to evoke an emotional response from visitors with its unusual architecture and aesthetics.
But museums in virtual spaces operate by a separate set of rules. In the case of Fortnite, Epic Games don’t permit gory or traumatising content to be placed within creations, so would limit any exhibits aspiring to communicate the full horror of the Holocaust.
Second Life exhibits have more freedom with content that can be included. However, depending on where you’re playing, there are different maturity ratings and strict policies regarding what type of content can be depicted in your region. Although this may allow for more gruesome aspects of the Holocaust to be depicted, it comes with the restriction that younger audiences would be unable to visit the exhibit.
New frontiers of education
Despite these limitations, computer game worlds offer new opportunities that would be logistically implausible or otherwise impossible for real-world museums. Large-scale exhibits that use rail networks to guide you through exhibitions, as well as flight or even teleportation, are entirely possible within games engines.
Aspiring creators would, however, do well to heed prior advice regarding the creation of such experiences, to ensure they are informative, factual, and handle the subject in a respectful manner. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has provided a set of guidelines for teaching about the Holocaust, including making responsible choices for designing a learning exercise.
Although Fortnite and Minecraft may be popular games for all age groups, there can be no denying that their primary target audiences are children and teenagers. With their vibrant colour palettes and cartoonish approaches to violence, the developers of both games have meticulously created gameplay that is appropriate for, and appealing to, children.
It can therefore be argued that it is young audiences who are the most likely to engage with these virtual exhibitions, and who may stand to learn from them. Indeed, Bernard has gone as far as to tweet:
At this point, having a Holocaust museum within Fortnite and releasing The Light in the Darkness in Unreal Engine will be educating people more about genocide than schools will be able to.
Traditionally, schools, textbooks and real-world museums have been the primary sources of knowledge on most subjects. However, in an era where the internet is intrinsically woven into daily life, and education has new ways of engaging with learners, are metaverse learning experiences going to be the new frontier of education?
In a study from 2020, adults in the US below the age of 40 were shown to have a poor understanding of the basic facts and figures of the Holocaust. Learning opportunities in platforms such as Fortnite, Second Life and Minecraft, and emerging virtual worlds like Meta’s Metaverse, offer exciting potential for using innovative approaches to engage learners. These educational avenues allow users to explore and learn from the comfort of their own homes and devices, inside the games they know and love.

"College students learn more calculus in an active learning course in which students solve problems during class than in a traditional lecture-based course. That’s according to a peer-reviewed study my colleagues and I published in Science. We also found that college students better understood complex calculus concepts and earned better grades in the active learning course.
The findings held across racial and ethnic groups, genders and college majors, and for both first-time college and transfer students – thus, promoting success for all students. Students in the active learning course had an associated 11% higher pass rate.
If you apply that rate to the current 300,000 students taking calculus each year in the U.S., it could mean an additional 33,000 pass their class.
Our experimental trial ran over three semesters – fall 2018 through fall 2019 – and involved 811 undergraduate students at a public university that has been designated as a Hispanic-serving institution. The study evaluated the impact of an engagement-focused active learning calculus teaching method by randomly placing students into either a traditional lecture-based class or the active learning calculus class.
The active learning intervention promoted development of calculus understanding during class, with students working through exercises designed to build calculus knowledge and with faculty monitoring and guiding the process.
This differs from the lecture setting where students passively listen to the instructor and develop their understanding outside of class, often on their own.
An active learning approach allows students to work together to solve problems and explain ideas to each other. Active learning is about understanding the “why” behind a subject versus merely trying to memorize it.
Along the way, students experiment with their ideas, learn from their mistakes and ultimately make sense of calculus. In this way, they replicate the practices of mathematicians, including making and testing educated guesses, sense-making and explaining their reasoning to colleagues. Faculty are a critical part of the process. They guide the process through probing questions, demonstrating mathematical strategies, monitoring group progress and adapting pace and activities to foster student learning.
Florida International University made a short video to accompany a research paper on how active learning improves outcomes for calculus students.
Why it matters
Calculus is a foundational discipline for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, as it provides the skills for designing systems as well as for studying and predicting change.
But historically it’s been a barrier that has ended the opportunity for many students to achieve their goal of a STEM career. Only 40% of undergraduate students intending to earn a STEM degree complete their degree, and calculus plays a role in that loss. The reasons vary depending on the student. Failing calculus can be a final straw for some.
And it is particularly concerning for historically underrepresented groups. The odds of female students leaving a STEM major after calculus is 1.5 times higher than it is for men. And Hispanic and Black students have a 50% higher failure rate than white students in calculus. These losses deprive the individual students of STEM aspirations, career dreams and financial security. And it deprives society of their potentially innovative contributions to solving challenging problems, such as climate resilience, energy independence, infrastructure and more.
What still isn’t known
A vexing challenge in calculus instruction – and across the STEM disciplines – is broad adoption of active learning strategies that work. We started this research to provide compelling evidence to show that this model works and to drive further change. The next step is addressing the barriers, including lack of time, questions about effectiveness and institutional policies that don’t provide an incentive for faculty to bring active learning to their classrooms.
A crucial next step is improving the evidence-based instructional change strategies that will promote adoption of active learning instruction in the classroom.
What’s next
Our latest results are motivating our team to further delve into the underlying instructional strategies that drive student understanding in calculus. We’re also looking for opportunities to replicate the experiment at a variety of institutions, including high schools, which will provide more insight into how to expand adoption across the nation.
We hope that this paper increases the rate of change of all faculty adopting active learning in their classrooms.

"With the blockbuster success of the Barbie movie and the related expansion of Barbie branding and merchandising, educators and parents may find themselves wondering about Barbie’s original purpose: as a child’s toy.
Barbie has become an icon since her introduction in 1959. On the positive side, dolls like Barbie can serve as a canvas for imaginative storytelling and role-playing.
Children often create elaborate scenarios, dialogues and relationships among their dolls, and they refer to the thoughts, emotions and desires of themselves and others while playing, supporting language and emotional development. Dolls often act as catalysts for children to explore different roles (or careers) and social scenarios, potentially encouraging aspirations and broadening horizons.
Additionally, Barbie play can promote fine motor skills as children dress and accessorize the dolls. Dolls can also facilitate social interaction when shared with peers or caregivers.
However, there is a potential downside. Barbie dolls come with predefined appearances and characteristics, which can limit the range of narratives a child may explore. There is also marketing of an entire “Barbie world” of branded objects, which many parents may choose not to invest in for financial or environmental reasons.

In the face of consumer pressures, while also being mindful of educational aspects of play, parents or caregivers can consider integrating open-ended everyday objects and versatile toys into children’s play with Barbie or other commercially successful toys.
This is a rewarding approach that promotes growth, creative thinking, adaptability and a sense of wonder.
Addressing stereotypes

While Mattel, the maker of Barbie, today features Barbies featuring multiple skin tones, hairstyles and body types, the original Barbie may reinforce certain stereotypes, particularly related to whiteness and gender roles. And while the Barbie brand has evolved, many unfortunate decisions were made historically.
For example, in 2014 Mattel apologized after readers complained about a book where Barbie as a computer engineer waited for males to save the day from computer difficulties.
Mattel’s release of Teen Talk Barbie in 1992 sparked controversy due to a particular phrase: “Math class is tough!” The phrase perpetuates the stereotype that struggling with math is expected or even normal.
The doll inadvertently contributed to a culture that discourages girls from pursuing mathematics and other STEM fields, reinforced gender biases and perpetuated misconceptions that can have far-reaching consequences on children’s educational choices and career aspirations.
When children play with dolls and toys, they are not just having fun, but also absorbing messages and attitudes from their playthings.

Influence on gendered outcomes
Researchers name play in early childhood as one of the powerful early influences on later gendered outcomes. The choice of toys and play materials can contribute to how adults reinforce gendered patterns and habits, encouraging boys and girls to develop different interests and skills.
For example, psychology researchers Emily F. Coyle and Lynn Liben explored the impact of gendered toy packaging in five-year-old children’s STEM play with their mothers. Mothers and their child (31 daughters; 30 sons) were randomly assigned to play with a mechanical toy packaged for girls (GoldieBlox) or boys (BobbyBlox).
They discovered children’s independent play varied with game packaging. When preparing for the play, mothers who were provided BobbyBlox built more toy pieces than those given the GoldieBlox.
Also, mothers built more with their sons, whereas they focused more on reading the toy’s instructions with their daughters. Further exploration of young children’s early STEM play patterns may effectively influence later outcomes.
Children may work out a range of imaginitive stories and scenes with Barbie and Barbie-like dolls. (Саша Круглая)
Creative fusion in play
Encouraging children to modify and personalize their play experience in a variety of ways can mitigate some of the stereotypical gender-specific effects of Barbie-like dolls.
Repurposing common materials to craft intricate settings and props, children are empowered to envision boundless scenarios. Creative fusion allows children to transform ordinary items into extraordinary elements within Barbie’s world. For example:
Through the use of open-ended materials such as cardboard, fabric and building blocks, children can construct intricate scenes and environments that serve as backdrops for Barbie-like dolls’ adventures. Cardboard boxes, for example, can be resourcefully repurposed into cars, planes or magical chariots.
Tiles, blocks (like Lego blocks) or other structural building materials can be combined with Barbie play. Designing structures, experimenting with balance and creating functional objects instils foundations for science, technology, engineering and mathematical learning.
By integrating natural elements like pebbles, leaves and twigs, adults can invite children to construct scenes that enrich the narrative with a sensory and tactile dimension. Natural materials such as sticks and leaves can be transformed into miniature furniture, bridges or forest habitats.
The personalized aspect of using everyday materials to create accessories or outfits for dolls, or combining toys to allow for envisioning new worlds, fosters a sense of autonomy in children and instils a sense of ownership and pride in their creations.
As children engage in collaborative play and work together to construct shared goals, they practice communication, teamwork and negotiation.
Using ordinary items also nurtures an early awareness of environmental consciousness in children, teaching them the value of repurposing materials, reducing waste — and the wondrous capacity of imaginative play.","Yes, the original Barbie is a stereotype — but children also create their own ‘Barbie worlds’",home page
"Teachers wear many hats. They are expected to be subject matter experts, leaders, administrators, managers, lifelong learners – and not just in the classroom, but in their wider communities.
It is crucial to cultivate teachers who are socially aware and critical, especially in today’s unequal society. This helps them to successfully prepare their learners to confront, for instance, excessive consumption, waste, and a society that prioritises material items over the preservation of natural resources.
But how can this cultivation occur? As an academic working with trainee teachers and researching social justice education, I have found four essential approaches that help future teachers develop their students into responsible global citizens.
Art and empathy
1. Identify the root cause of the problem instead of the one at face value.
Social injustice results from unequal power relations. This may seem obvious, but sometimes people need guidance to keep this fact in mind. I often use defamiliarisation to help trainee teachers grasp this reality. Defamiliarisation is the artistic technique of making things that are familiar seem unusual and foreign, to disrupt the mindset.
I have also explored how important this approach is in making students think more critically about global citizenship education.
For example, I often have my students look at current economic policies and international trade deals to see how these affect developing countries in Africa and often lead to economic and social imbalances. They are frequently urged to examine how uneven power relationships between western and African countries can worsen inequality and learn how they can work for fairness and equality in foreign relations. They do this by, for example, drawing how they view globalisation in Africa.

2. Develop critical empathy.
Empathy is not enough to get students to think in more socially conscious ways. That’s because, even when they start placing themselves in the shoes of others, it can still put them in a position of power over those whose lives they are trying to imagine.
Philosopher Nel Noddings coined the term “critical empathy”. This requires what is known as “empathic accuracy”, when teachers really understand how their students feel. It also needs what is called a “sympathetic response”: teachers not only understanding their learners’ thoughts but also feeling some of their sadness or happiness. It’s like going through their emotional journey with them, with the idea of assisting them in any possible way.
For example, I have used critical empathy to help my students connect to and understand each other’s struggles and experiences of the COVID pandemic. Rather than talking for each other, they talk with each other, and don’t try to wear someone else’s metaphorical shoes, but listen to and learn about people’s actual experiences.
3. Develop the ability to trust and take risk.
Realising that change is necessary implies that everyone is a part of both the problem and the solution. Sociologist Anthony Giddens’s work examines the relationship between trust and risk. Giddens challenges us: would you be brave enough to step into the unknown with someone you trust? Our past either holds us back or makes us want to take risks, and this balance of trust and risk could alter the way students, teachers and communities function in school environments.
Since 2016, I have facilitated a critical service-learning project – a form of service learning with a social justice orientation – where students work with local communities to solve fundamental problems such as inadequate education or food insecurity in poor areas in Cape Town, South Africa. There is an inherent risk for communities here: we’re asking them to work collaboratively with us, relying on their trust in such engagements – and this may not always produce the desired results for communities.
Although the projects are not always as successful as planned, reflective learning still proves helpful. Students learn to understand and gain real-world insights; communities feel more able to share concerns and work together to solve them.
4. Reflect critically, even if thoughts are conflicted.
I once used the film Krotoa to ignite discussions on the effects of colonialism’s legacy in South Africa. Based on a true story, the South African film is about a young girl who was taken from her Khoi tribe to work for founding colonial administrator Jan van Riebeeck.
Many students were left deeply unsettled. They felt pain, anger, helplessness and confusion. Experiencing these feelings in the classroom pushed them out of their comfort zones – precisely what was needed to encourage deep understanding. Critical reflection develops when students are forced outside their comfort zones. These intense emotions act as catalysts that prompt students to reflect on who they are, challenge their preconceived ideas and think carefully about the causes and effects of what they are learning. Students can gain a better, deeper understanding of the topic of colonisation, for instance, by grappling with these emotions and examining them.
Such encounters broaden students’ perspectives and encourage them to embrace the idea of ubuntu (a concept that emphasises the importance of including everyone and building a strong community). This fosters their development as thoughtful global citizens ready to contribute significantly to conversations about global justice and equality.",Teachers can nurture students who care about the world: four approaches that would help them,education
"In recent years there’s been growing recognition among education experts that integrating content and language learning is key to promoting comprehensive academic achievement.
This is particularly relevant in multilingual education systems where English serves as the primary medium of instruction.
So, in 2013, South Africa’s Department of Basic Education, which is responsible for primary and secondary education, set out to enhance academic performance through a strategy called English Across the Curriculum. This approach involves integrating language skills in content subjects such as history. Language skills include listening and speaking; reading and viewing; writing and presenting; and language structures and conventions.
The initiative was designed to guide teachers in public schools who lacked prior experience in merging content subjects like history, physical sciences and mathematics with language learning. It was a compulsory tool to reinforce the use of English as a language of learning and teaching and a way to address language barriers to academic success in primary and high schools.
Four years later, the department released a report revealing that many content teachers were not using the strategy effectively. As an expert in curriculum studies, I wanted to know what was holding teachers back. I conducted qualitative research that focused on grade 8 social science educators teaching history at four schools in the Eastern Cape province.
My findings suggest that most educators were not intentionally choosing or setting out to integrate English language learning skills with history content. Two of the four schools did not have formal, explicit policies to use English Across the Curriculum.
But, intriguingly, I found that the history teachers at the schools without such policies still worked to impart language skills to their pupils. They were able to do so for several reasons.
Firstly, they adjusted their teaching to encompass both language and subject skills, driven by their extensive understanding of how their subject is taught and the support needed for learners to develop historical competence. Second, they were personally committed to imparting language skills. And third, they were proficient in the English language themselves.
This underscores the idea that effective teaching practices transcend mere policy implementation. They also require educators to be well-equipped with both skills to teach in any context to ensure that their pupils learn with comprehension as opposed to just implementing policies.
What teachers told me
I had the opportunity to interview 15 teachers who teach grade 8 history at seven schools. Grade 8 is the entry level to South Africa’s secondary school; the average age of pupils at this level is 14 or 15.
In my initial discussions with these 15 teachers, 11 indicated that, while they were aware of the English Across the Curriculum approach, they were not using it.
I ultimately interviewed four teachers from four schools. All were intentionally choosing to integrate content and language teaching. Two did so because of their schools’ policies. They taught at what are often referred to as former model C schools (reserved for white students before 1994 and fairly well-resourced).
The other two schools were in highly populated and resource-constrained communities and did not have English Across the Curriculum policies. However, the teachers I interviewed took the initiative and used language teaching as an academic support mechanism for their learners.
All four teachers primarily employed activities such as vocabulary development, clustering exercises, and the use of writing frames that encompassed sentences and paragraphs. Clustering activities allowed the learners to use mind maps and word associations as a way of encouraging them to organise historical ideas into interconnected categories and narratives. They said these exercises helped to make learning more engaging and interactive. One of the teachers told me:
For grade 8s, these activities help organise their thoughts and language structures. It allows for free-writing and peer feedback. When they have ideas and points on what to write, they complete their tasks satisfactorily. I am saying satisfactorily because for most of them, the language is a struggle. You know sometimes, I wish they could just write in isiXhosa or Afrikaans.
The teachers also told me they knew it was important to impart language skills because some of their grade 8 learners, emerging from the COVID pandemic, had not fully developed their vocabulary and writing abilities in primary school. One of the teachers explained that:
Instead of just teaching history, I also work on helping them with their language skills. History needs learners that can read with comprehension, so it would be pointless to teach them without providing reading strategies. While this approach may be time-consuming, it is helpful to my learners.
Training is key
My findings suggest that, while English Across the Curriculum policies are undoubtedly important, educators’ individual commitment and adaptability, coupled with their expertise in subject-specific language, play an important role in achieving successful integration of language and content instruction.
There are several ways that my findings could be integrated into training. The Department of Basic Education requires in-service teachers to pursue continuous professional development. The coordinators of that development must prioritise English as a medium of instruction alongside content teaching in secondary schools.
Trainee teachers, meanwhile, should be equipped with the pedagogical skills needed to seamlessly integrate content and language teaching in the secondary school curriculum.
My findings also emphasise the crucial role that schools play in nurturing a sense of agency among teachers. The two teachers whose schools did not have a policy were still empowered to teach in a manner that fostered effective learning. They used their knowledge about their schools’ communities and their individual students to facilitate language development.
But policies are still important: a structured approach to integrating content and language teaching indicates a collaborative effort between a school’s administration and its educators.",History teaching in South Africa could be vastly improved – if language skills were added to the mix,education
"Philosophies of education serve as frameworks for producing lifelong learners and a knowledgeable and skilled human workforce who develop their societies. Ghana’s education system currently favours a western educational philosophy, relegating its indigenous philosophies to the back burner.
I am an academic in the field of curriculum studies. In a recent paper, I argue that education in Ghana needs to incorporate more elements based on an authentic Ghanaian framework. Based on the view that education, culture and development should be connected, I highlight the educational strengths of African folklore.
I conclude that aspects of Akan folklore, including its stories and proverbs, its kinship rights and rules, its moral codes, its corporate and humanistic perspective, complement the country’s current westernised education.
It is in this spirit that education lecturer Kofi Poku Quan-Baffour has referred to the Akan proverb Tete wobi ka, tete wobi kyere. It means “heritage has lots to say, heritage has lots to teach”. Folklore holds benefits.
The case for Akan folklore
Ghana has about 92 ethnic groups. The largest of these is the Akan. They can be found in eight of the 16 regions of the country and in parts of Côte d'Ivoire and Togo. The influence of the Akan in Ghana and west Africa is not just by virtue of their numerical strength but also due to their strong culture and the spirit that binds them. They have been able to maintain their culture throughout the blows of colonial history.
I argue that Akan folklore can be integrated into the school curricula to teach social skills and emotional intelligence. After all, education seeks to provide learners with the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will make them functional and responsible members of their communities.
This tool may also benefit learners in colleges of education and universities offering Ghanaian languages and related courses. The crucial question here is: where is the place of indigenous pedagogy as a tool in nursing and agricultural training colleges, technical universities and the like?
Without indigenous components in their course curricula, students may graduate from such institutions as professionals who have lost their culture. They will not pass on indigenous values in their own teaching practice.
Not just proverbs and stories
Researchers such as Grace Diabah and Nana Appiah Amfo have established the power of folklore types like proverbs to deal with important topics like gender. Unfortunately, the focus of education has leaned heavily towards examination performance and readying learners for the job market. There is no recourse to the rich culture of the people. The absence of indigenous components in course curricula results in a graduate population without any appreciation for cultural identity.
In their study on integrating indigenous knowledge in the teaching of intermediate mathematics, for example, James Owusu-Mensah and Kofi Poku Quan-Baffour argue that Akan indigenous knowledge systems such as storytelling and games could make subjects easier for learners to relate to and comprehend.
Furthermore, short Akan sayings add spice to the debate that African philosophies can contribute to sustainable quality education for development. Examples such as Kwan nkyɛn ade yɛfɛ, wᴐde sika na ɛyɛ, which roughly translates to “money is needed for everything” and wᴐnsom ԑne nipa (success accrues from collective efforts) undoubtedly take most Ghanaians back to their roots to learn hard, work diligently and live cooperatively.
The urgent need to preserve the environment and its biodiversity also resonates in traditional taboos. These establish rules on days not to farm, hunt or go fishing. This is also done to keep certain flora and fauna sacred and protected.
Looking ahead
My research revealed that there is a need to develop and use an alternative indigenous philosophical framework, drawing on Akan folklore. There is a need to display a sense of commonalities, affirm culture, tradition and value systems, and foster comprehension of the local consciousness in a bid to resolve the challenges people are facing.
In a nutshell, while western philosophies open students up to global understandings and perspectives, Akan folklore grounds them in their own culture. Quality education of the kind proposed in this article will produce students and graduates who are beneficial to their societies while understanding, appreciating, cooperating and contributing to global issues and development.",Akan folklore contains ancient wisdom that could benefit Ghana’s western-style education system,education
"As a visual artist and educator, I know how important it is to encourage your child to think and behave like an artist. But this is not necessarily about drawing or painting in a particular way.
The habits of an artist include the ability to generate ideas, trust in creative processes, be comfortable with ambiguity, take risks and embrace failure.
All this helps children embrace “failures” as a learning experience. In doing so, you are building their resilience.
These are all transferable skills kids can use in other areas of learning and life. As the late UK education expert Ken Robinson said:
If you are not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original.
How to think and behave like an artist
You can encourage children to develop the habits of an artist by providing opportunities for them to take creative risks and use problem finding skills. Problem finding skills are identifying unforeseen problems using critical and analytic thinking.
Here are three art activities to try in the holidays – or any time – to build these skills.
These activities work for kids from five and up. Some children will need help but parents should try to be the “guide on the side”. This means helping children make their own discoveries and not jumping in and taking over.

1. Blind contour drawing
Examples of blind contour portraits, done by Naomi Zouwer’s family at the dinner table. Naomi Zouwer, Author provided (no reuse)
In blind contour drawing you don’t look at the paper while you draw and once your drawing implement touches the paper, you don’t lift it off until you are done.
You can draw anything, but portraits are a lot of fun. Look closely at your subject and slowly draw what you see, looking for lines and contours to draw in and around them.
This is a gentle way of extending creative potential of drawing. It also stops your inner critic telling you you “can’t draw” (because you can’t see what you’re doing, so you can’t criticise yourself). It also connects your hand to your brain and allows you to draw what you see, not what you think you see.
The lines are always lovely. They are free flowing and fluid as opposed to what I call “furry lines” that show all insecurities, second thoughts and apprehensions.

2. Make your own brushes
Mark-making tools can include sticks, twigs, leaves and tape. Naomi Zouwer., Author provided (no reuse)
In a previous article, I talked about how to make paint.
Another similar activity is making brushes or “mark-making tools” as I like to call them. You can use a range of materials from outside or even the recycling bin: a few sticks, masking tape and some string. Tie a bunch of twigs and leaves or feathers together and bind them to the top of a stick.
Why use not the bottom of the stick to make a double-ended tool? Or cut up an old sponge and tie it to a stick.
Try really long sticks or short stubby sticks. The size and shape of the stick will change the way you use it and affect the marks you will make.
Dip your tools in ink and try them out on reams of butcher’s paper rolled out in a space where children feel free to move around and put their body into it. You can use paint too, though you might want to add water to make it runnier.
This encourages becoming comfortable with uncertainty (who knows what marks these new tools will make?).
In this context “failure” might look like the tool not making the mark the child had in their mind. This forces the child to either go with the mark it makes or go back and redesign their tool.
This helps children to become comfortable with that idea of testing, experimenting and creating your way through an issue.
3. Change your medium and your size
Willow charcoal – made from burnt willow branches – is an excellent medium for experimenting with and enables children to “draw big”.
It can be crumbly and smudges easily (it’s also extremely messy) so it can make some unexpected marks and children can explore a range of tones from black to light grey.
Take an object like an egg and get children to draw it larger-than-life. Naomi Zouwer, Author provided (no reuse)
Children can use the tip of it to draw lines, or use the side of the stick to create wide shapes and shades.
Get some large pieces of paper and encourage your child to draw as big as they can to create huge gestural drawings with the charcoal. This encourages kids to move out of their comfort zone (and beyond A4 paper).
Challenge them to upscale what they see, such as flowers or their favourite object. Or put on some music and suggest to your child they draw what they hear and feel.
If you don’t have charcoal, you could also use jumbo chalk and draw on the footpath.
Using an eraser to draw into charcoal. Naomi Zouwer, Author provided (no reuse)
Another approach is to sit on a piece of paper and get them to trace their bodies, move, trace themselves and again, like Australian artist Julie Rrap.
If the page gets covered in charcoal just keep going, cover the paper completely with charcoal and then use a eraser to draw “in reverse”.
As I have said before, try not to worry about the mess. This is also part of being an artist – and learning to think like one, too.

"Countries in sub-Saharan Africa have made remarkable progress towards reaching universal school enrolment in the past 25 years. Across the region, 8 in 10 children of primary school age are now enrolled in school, and in countries such as Benin and Madagascar this figure stands at almost 10 in 10 children.
However, it is becoming increasingly clear that many children in the region are learning very little in school. This “learning crisis” means that it will be difficult to reach the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of quality education for all by 2030.
Importantly, the learning crisis does not affect all countries equally. For example, a recent study found that whereas almost half of all sixth-grade students (who are on average about 13 years old) in Niger have difficulties reading a simple sentence, only one in 10 sixth-grade students in neighbouring Burkina Faso has such problems. This raises the question of what explains these international learning gaps.
In a recent study, my co-authors Natalie Irmert, Mohammad H. Sepahvand and I tried to answer this question. We hypothesised that differences in teacher quality between countries play a role. Using comparable data from 14 countries in French-speaking sub-Saharan Africa, we found that differences in teachers’ subject knowledge – that is, teachers’ mastery of the material they are expected to teach in a given subject – explain more than a third of the international variation in student learning.
This implies that the very low levels of learning in some countries’ schools are to a large extent due to a lack of knowledgeable teachers.
The research
Our study was made possible by the recent release of data from the PASEC 2019 assessment. The assessment measured sixth-grade students’ reading and maths skills in 14 French-speaking African countries in a comparable way. Importantly for our purposes, it also measured the knowledge of these students’ teachers in the same two subjects. The assessment revealed very large differences in the average reading and maths skills of students between countries.
Read more: Collaboration is helping teachers in rural Cameroon fill knowledge gaps
In our study, we examined whether these international differences in student skills were driven by gaps in teachers’ subject knowledge. We hypothesised that this might be the case based on previous research from individual countries which shows that teacher quality is a key driver of learning.
Our results showed student skills and teachers’ subject knowledge were indeed positively correlated: better teacher knowledge tended to go hand in hand with better student skills.
However, this did not necessarily mean that teachers’ subject knowledge caused learning. For example, countries with more knowledgeable teachers might also invest more into school buildings. In this case, the positive correlation between teacher knowledge and student skills could simply reflect the better learning conditions due to improved school buildings.
Explaining the differences
To be sure that our correlation reflected a causal effect of teacher knowledge, we used a statistical trick: we compared each country’s student skills and teacher knowledge in reading to its student skills and teacher knowledge in maths.
Read more: Girls thrive with women teachers: a study in Francophone Africa
This meant that we could keep all factors that did not differ between the two subjects, such as the quality of school buildings, constant. If better teachers’ knowledge in reading relative to maths tended to go hand in hand with better student skills in reading relative to maths, we could be certain that the effect of teacher knowledge was causal.
The figure below shows that this was indeed the case: for example, Burundi’s teachers scored relatively low on the reading test relative to the maths test, and consequently its students did worse in the reading assessment than in the maths assessment. In contrast, Gabon’s teachers were relatively more knowledgeable in reading, and therefore its students also performed better in the reading test.
Teachers’ subject knowledge boosts student skills. Authors supplied
Overall, differences in teachers’ subject knowledge could explain a third of the differences in student learning between the 14 countries. Our data did not allow us to conclude which factors explain the remaining two thirds of these differences.
Implications for policy
Our results show that teacher quality, and especially teacher subject knowledge, is a crucial driver of cross-country differences in learning. This is an important insight for policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa who are trying to solve the “learning crisis”: it shows that there is a large payoff to recruiting more knowledgeable teachers.
Additionally, in-service training that improves the knowledge of already employed teachers could lead to large gains in student learning.",How well you do at school depends on how much your teachers know: insights from 14 French-speaking countries in Africa,education

We asked Elisheba Kiru, who studies education and empowerment, and Aulo Gelli, whose focus is food policy and nutrition, to analyse the new meal programme.
Why are school meals an important intervention?
Households are wrestling with steep increases in living costs brought about by factors like inflation, climate change and the effects of the COVID pandemic. These pressures are felt most by vulnerable populations, particularly those living in dry regions and in informal urban settlements.
There’s a need for innovative solutions using localised, low-tech approaches that improve the quality of life, especially for children.
We have known for several decades about the role of school feeding as a lifeline for children during crises. School feeding results in increased enrolment and improved retention. It also improves cognitive abilities and learning capacity, and reduces absenteeism. The meals provide nutrients necessary for brain development, reducing anaemia and stunting, and increasing immunity. These results are even more pronounced for girls and children living in poverty, defined as living on less than a dollar a day.
School meal plans operate in nearly every country in the world, reaching over 400 million children for about US$48 billion per year. In Ghana, a study found that the national school feeding programme led to a 14% improvement in literacy scores, 13% in mathematics, and 8% in reasoning ability for girls. Impact evaluations in Kenya over two decades ago revealed that supplementing animal source food contributed to children’s cognitive performance, weight gain and height gain. Another study found improvements in the iron status of schoolchildren in Kenya, with meals fortified with whole maize flour.
As of 2018, Kenya’s home-grown school meal programme, launched in 2009, covered 1.5 million children in drought-affected lands. The meal programme helped learners stay in school, strengthened their physical and mental health outcomes and increased future financial security.
What’s new about the Nairobi initiative?
The Nairobi subsidised meal programme aims to provide all pre-primary and grade 1-8 learners in the county’s public schools with a daily school meal. It will serve over 250,000 students and has an annual budget of 1.7 billion KES (US$11.8 million).
The Nairobi County government financed the construction of 10 kitchens. They will be operated by Food for Education, a social enterprise with experience in this area. It currently serves 165,000 meals per day in five counties.
The new programme provides an opportunity for learning more about school feeding programmes and effective approaches to address key challenges in Kenya. These challenges include:
equity in making sure students with special needs benefit
awareness of food security and nutrition for child development
accountability in procurement of food sources and equipment
sustainability through zero waste, recycling and green energy.
Some think the programme falls short in addressing inequalities among Nairobi’s children. They argue that the initiative overlooks a large population of students living in informal settlements and attending low-cost private schools. Those children are ineligible for the programme.
All students deserve school meals and no student should go hungry. The question of eligibility deserves urgent attention to ensure more, not fewer, students are fed.
There are also opportunities to test cost-recovery mechanisms that balance equity and financial sustainability considerations. The national and county level governments could provide farmers and communities with support to encourage local production, through subsidies or cost-sharing.
What needs to be done to make the Nairobi meals programme a success?
In our experience, school feeding programmes in Africa usually have two limitations. First, they are of limited scale in contrast with the needs. Second, they are fragmented.

The Nairobi programme provides opportunities to learn and establish evidence at scale about effectiveness and impact. As part of programme monitoring and evaluation, the voices of stakeholders like farmers and community leaders should also be documented to provide an all round perspective. The feedback will also make adjustments possible when they are needed. A strong monitoring and evaluation system can also be used to hold implementers accountable and help governments solicit funding support from development partners.
School meals should strive to provide nutritious diets by serving diverse, safe, palatable, and locally available foods. Governments could explore linking farmers to school feeding programmes to encourage local production and a consistent market for produce. As a starting point, developing clear quality standards for school meals across the country, including food, nutrition, and smallholder sourcing requirements, provides the basis to achieve the multiple benefits from the programme.
What’s the way forward?
The political class must build on the interdependencies that school feeding creates. For instance, Kenya’s new school curriculum amplifies creativity and problem solving in real-life situations. There’s an opportunity for some public schools with idle land to establish school farms.
To sustain the programme, innovative financing and shared responsibility between government and the private sector must be explored. The main incentive for collaborative planning between the government, actors like Food for Education, and others is increased programme impact and lowered costs due to improved operational efficiency and economies of scale.
The scaling up of the Dishi Na County programme also provides a unique opportunity to generate robust empirical evidence on the costs and benefits of school feeding programmes.

"Formal education in the Gold Coast, now Ghana, was introduced during the 15th century when Europeans came to its shores to trade. Education was only accessible to children of women married to western traders, and it focused on teaching them how to read and write. The primary aim was to create an educated class to support and run colonial activities.
By 1882, Britain was established as the colonial power in the region. Educational opportunities were limited, and educational assessments served as the gatekeeper to education. They focused on academic knowledge and English proficiency. Results were used to select students for higher education and white-collar jobs.
The roots of this practice are still evident in Ghana’s education system. Students are streamed into three tiers of secondary schools, with disparities in educational resources across streams.
Our recent study explored the history of educational assessment in Ghana, and how colonisation and political accountability shaped the use of assessment information in schools. We observed that assessment has primarily served accountability purposes, obscuring its function of improving students’ learning.
Influence of colonisation
The colonial legacy of assessment still influences Ghana’s current testing practices, through a system that emphasises imperialist notions of merit and achievement.
The West African Examinations Council, responsible for mandated tests in anglophone west African countries, including Ghana, was established by the British in 1950. Ghana’s assessment system still relies largely on this framework, as western universities require excellent scores on these tests for undergraduate admissions. Additionally, high-stakes examinations persist due to the pressure to meet global education standards through international comparisons of student achievement.
Political accountability
It is common for Ghanaians to measure the quality of education by the number of students who pass the national mandated testing. Student assessments are used as political performance indicators and tools for public policy and political accountabiltiy. For example, over the past five years, the government has invested about US$5.8 million to buy past exam questions to assist students.
Teachers are also held accountable for students’ performance in national exams. As a result, they end up teaching with the primary motive of preparing students for these tests. Educators and students focus on exam success rather than learning.
Free schooling
To support inclusive and equitable access to education and increase enrolment rates, Ghana introduced a free senior high school policy in 2017. Yet disparities in access to and enrolment in secondary education persist between children from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Critics argue that the policy was hastily implemented for political reasons, lacking proper consideration of its long-term implications and costs. Others argue that the policy is a way to increase enrolment in secondary schools.
Importantly, its effectiveness is tied to students’ performance in the Basic Education Certificate Examination. A student’s outcome on this examination also determines their placement in one of the secondary school streams via a computerised system.
Read more: Ghana's high school system sets many students up for failure: it needs a rethink
The policy mostly benefits students who pass the exam and qualify for placement. Those who come from low socioeconomic backgrounds or rural areas are often at a disadvantage.
Failing the exam hinders students from progressing to senior high schools or technical institutes in Ghana.
Influence of high-stakes exam
The high-stakes nature of large-scale assessments in Ghana’s education system fosters disengagement among poor students and teachers.
The focus on exams overshadows the intended learning goals of teaching and many other forms of assessment. Evaluation of teachers and schools is linked to student performance in tests. Teachers therefore tend to narrow their curriculum to what’s tested. This means:
creativity and meaningful learning are eroded
some pupils struggle to master the curriculum content
there’s less teaching time for students with special needs
there may be unethical practices to ensure students pass.
Students from low socio-economic backgrounds and those with special learning needs often find themselves marginalised by these assessments. Ultimately, the results of large-scale assessments segregate students into categories of secondary schools, based on limited resources.
Future directions and policy implications
The principle of fairness implies that students’ progression shouldn’t rely on a single test score, as is the case in Ghana. To meet the country’s equity goals, the system should consider diverse indicators and assessments of student learning.
The educational access policies of Ghana provide an opportunity to reform assessments. They can shed their colonial roots and encourage high quality teaching and student learning.
Reformed policies should balance various forms and purposes of assessment, and provide teacher guidelines and professional development.
Transforming Ghana’s testing culture to one that supports meaningful learning and equitable educational outcomes is a considerable challenge. But it’s an essential one if the country is to reach equitable education for all.",Ghana’s colonial past and assessment use means education prioritises passing exams over what students actually learn – this must change,education
"For any woman, pregnancy and giving birth are major life-changing experiences. Becoming a mother brings with it a range of emotions and, in many African cultures, positive emotions are centred when talking about motherhood.
Scholarship from the eastern, western and southern parts of the continent has emphasised how motherhood is linked to notions of continuity, strength and sacrifice, unconditional love, consecration and spirituality, family ties, loyalty and happiness.
In many African cultures, mothers are expected to be resilient, happy and tenacious. But what about the often “silenced” aspect of motherhood? Generally, mothers are not expected or encouraged to share any negative emotions about their experiences and role. Those who defy this expectation are frequently stigmatised and labelled “bad mothers”.
These responses often arise from the belief that motherhood is life’s key purpose. Seen through this societal lens, becoming a mother ought to be fulfilling and overwhelmingly positive.
But human emotions are complex. People can experience joy and sadness simultaneously. This is underscored by our study among HIV-positive mothers in South Africa about their experiences of motherhood. These young women, aged between 16 and 24, told us how they grappled with harsh realities and daily challenges.
They expressed regret about their unplanned experience of motherhood and wished their circumstances were different. It was clear they were experiencing conflicting internal emotions as they considered the roles, responsibilities and difficulties of motherhood.
Such negative emotions – especially regret – are seldom expressed when talking about motherhood. This leaves little room for African mothers to be vulnerable. To change this ideology and practice, safe space must be created for these feelings.
Doing so can promote open, honest and non-judgmental discussions that will lead to changes in the narratives surrounding motherhood, influence practices and boost emotional, mental and physical health. It can allow mothers and their children to thrive and be better equipped with the necessary skills to face life, irrespective of their challenges.
Motherhood is hard
We conducted one-on-one, in-depth interviews with ten HIV-positive mothers in Johannesburg, South Africa. The women all became mothers when they were adolescents. Their children’s ages ranged from two months to seven years old. We also interviewed three key stakeholders who, through their work as academics and researchers and in the healthcare field, engaged closely with adolescent mothers and HIV-positive individuals in South Africa.
None of the young mothers had planned to become pregnant. They were dealing with intersecting psychological, socioeconomic, health, cultural and physiological dynamics. They were stepping into new, unknown realities: as young mothers, some still had school responsibilities. Others were unemployed, as is the case for most adolescent girls and young women aged between 15 and 24 in South Africa. They depended financially on others such as their grandmothers, the government’s monthly child support grant, or transactional sex partners.
Their HIV status created another layer of complexity due to the attached health responsibilities, stigma and shame. Apart from the high susceptibility of adolescent girls to unplanned pregnancy and HIV infection in South Africa, another important reason for working with this group of mothers was to give voice to their experience and to possibly inform relevant policies.
No judgment
We created a safe, non-judgmental space in which the young women could share their feelings, both positive and negative. At least half of the participants told us that this was the first time they’d felt able to freely narrate their experiences, especially negative feelings about the experience of motherhood. Away from the pressure of cultural beliefs and expectations, they opened up.
The most prominent emotions they expressed were negative: specifically, they felt regret and anger. Their reflections were sometimes painful. One said:
I will always feel like I robbed myself of my childhood, and at times I will resent my child. I would hit my child so badly, and even though she couldn’t hear what I was saying but I will always tell her that I regret being with her.
Another told us:
I don’t know whether it was worth it, but I know maybe I could have prevented it … I wish I had known how difficult it was to actually be a mother.
This is a powerful negation of society’s notion that the moment a woman becomes a mother, she has access to knowledge and systems that enable her to maintain the image of “the good mother”. The notion that the fear and doubt will be pushed aside and only positive emotions will dominate is simply false.
Most of the mothers also shared the joy and rewarding feelings of having their children. One stated that:
… at first I was scared, but now I am happy because I look at her and she inspires me a lot … now I am seeing life in another way … with the support of my aunt and friends, I feel better.
Another said:
… it is good to see my baby laughing, happy, playing, very nice … like it is very (long pause) … it is beautiful … I like him smiling cos I’m like I can no longer imagine my life without my son (laughs).
Freedom and support
It’s time to shift the conversation from conventional and rigid constructions of motherhood to a more open, inclusive picture across Africa.
This will do more than just give mothers the freedom to express the full range of their emotions about motherhood: it can also contribute to more inclusive, tailored policies and programmes that take into account the many complexities and dilemmas our participants spoke about.
These might include access to need-specific, supportive, non-judgmental counsellors and therapists, and increased peer mentorship programmes, as well as access to sexual and reproductive health information and career support programmes.","‘Motherhood is hard’: young, HIV-positive mums in South Africa open up about regret and anger",education
"This article contains spoilers for seasons one and two of Heartstopper.
It’s confession time. Despite being well into my fifties, I am a Heartstopper super-fan. For those who don’t know Heartstopper, it is Alice Osman’s Netflix adaptation of their boy-meets-boy graphic novel. Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) and their LGBTQ+ friends come of age and fall in love at school.
I am not the target audience for Heartstopper – the second series of which has recently been released. It is squarely aimed at young people and LGBTQ+ young people in particular. However, I was a secondary school teacher for more than 20 years and Heartstopper to me is a joyous depiction of what teaching and schools could have been, but for me, never was.
This was because almost all my teaching career was spent under a law called Section 28. Between 1988 and 2003, Section 28 of Margaret Thatcher’s Local Government Act prevented teachers in schools from promoting the acceptability of homosexuality as a “pretended family relationship”.
Teaching under Section 28
In my book Pretended: Schools and Section 28, I describe the mandated homophobic silence that descended upon every school in Britain. As a teacher in a so-called “pretended family relationship”, I feared constantly that I would lose my job if I was outed at school.
“Pretending” became my MO: I pretended to live alone, I pretended to have boyfriends, I pretended to be too busy to talk to students I thought might be gay and, I am ashamed to say, I pretended not to notice when queer students were being harassed by their peers.
My research with other LGBTQ+ teachers shows that Section 28 profoundly affected those who experienced it. I found that 48% of LGBTQ+ teachers who taught under this law sought help for anxiety or depression linked to their role as a teacher and their sexual or gender identity.
My biggest regret as a teacher under Section 28 is that I could not be a positive role model for the young LGBTQ+ people I taught. Thankfully, this law is now long gone from schools and so Charlie, Nick and their queer friends have excellent teacher role models.
The indomitable PE teacher, Miss Singh (Chetna Pandya), ably coaches the boys’ rugby team. When she catches Charlie and Nick kissing after rugby practice, she asks to meet with Nick, the team captain. There is no telling off or warning from Miss Singh. Instead she tells Nick that she met her wife through rugby and we see a framed photograph of the couple on her school desk. If only, I find myself musing as I think back to my time as a PE teacher.

Mr Ajayi (Fisayo Akinade) is the gentle, generous and caring art teacher, whose tiny Pride lapel badge serves as the subtlest reminder to Charlie, Nick and co that he has their backs. When Mr Ajayi finds romance himself with another male teacher, there is no hint of the fear or shame that eventually drove me and countless other LGBTQ+ teachers from careers in teaching. Mr Ajayi is his authentic, queer, brilliant self in his school workplace. If only, I think again.
Charlie, Nick and their friends face challenges whenever they step outside their protective queer bubble. In Heartstopper, the hetero and cis-normative world can still be a perilous place for queer young people. Nick worries constantly about coming out to the school rugby team and his older brother, home from university, is savagely cruel.
Charlie’s mother initially does all she can to stop him seeing Nick, and the mother of Tara, another LGBTQ+ character, forbids her from wearing a suit to prom as she will “look like a lesbian”. In all, the adults make a bit of a mess of things and make life harder than it needs to be for Nick, Charlie and their friends.
Adult influence
The Heartstopper friendship bubble is a safe place. The friends have compassion in abundance as they warmly embrace and accept their differences. They show respect, sensitivity and empathy for each other as together they figure out who they are and who they love. They are a nourishing presence in each other’s lives, cheering one other on and picking each other up when things don’t go to plan. When they have each other they do just fine. They don’t do quite so well when the adults intervene.
Since my own Section 28 diaries helped inspire the Bafta-nominated film Blue Jean, many of my former students have been in touch. Several who are LGBTQ+ tell me they were not previously aware of Section 28 but now understand why I and other teachers they suspected were gay never supported them at school. Now, learning something of my own struggles as a teacher, some have thankfully forgiven me for “pretending” and not being the role model they needed in school.
I have started to imagine what impact the forthcoming government trans guidance for schools would have on the young characters in Heartstopper – such as the group’s trans friend Elle (Yasmin Finney). There are fears that the trans guidance will be a reimagining of Section 28.
Press reports suggested that young trans people would only be able to socially transition at school – take actions such as changing their pronouns and name and changing how they dress – with their parent’s permission. It is of note that the Department for Education missed its own deadline for publishing the guidance, when the attorney general advised that possible stricter measures, such as a proposed ban on social transition at school, was in breach of the government’s own Equality Act.
Season two of Heartstopper teaches us that young queer people are doing a brilliant job of supporting each other as they figure out their sexual and gender identities. It is the adults who have lots to learn. Heartstopper also shows us that without government intervention on sexual or gender identities, schools have become much more nurturing, safe and inclusive places for LGBTQ+ staff and students than the schools I remember during Section 28.",Heartstopper: how this joyous teen show contrasts with my bitter memories of school life under homophobic law Section 28,arts + culture
"Uncommon Courses is an occasional series from The Conversation U.S. highlighting unconventional approaches to teaching.
Title of course:
“Canine Learning and Behavior”
What prompted the idea for the course?
When I was growing up, my love for animals led me to volunteer at animal shelters. But it wasn’t until I started teaching psychology that I found another way to support the well-being of shelter animals. During my first year of teaching a psychology course about learning, I realized that the course’s content could be used to train shelter dogs.
Since some shelter dogs display problematic behaviors, such as fearfulness, destructiveness and disobedience, they are less likely to get adopted. I wanted my students to use their knowledge, passion and care to train shelter dogs and improve their chances of finding a permanent home.
What does the course explore?
The course teaches students how to apply behavioral analysis and modification techniques toward the training of shelter dogs. Students work with dogs on learning to follow cues such as “sit,” “down,” “stay” and “come”; perform tricks such as “high-five,” and “roll over”; and complete agility courses made of tunnels, hoops and weaving poles.
The course also explores the emotional, psychological and physiological benefits of the human-animal bond, such as reduced stress, by integrating the dogs into educational and therapeutic environments. For instance, the students train the dogs to sit by them calmly for the entire duration of a lecture. This skill may be important for future adopters who work within an educational setting or need their dog to accompany them into the classroom.
The students also train the dogs to visit our clinical educational facility, the Experiential Learning Commons, which was built as a mock hospital. Within our simulated emergency room, intensive care room, patient room, maternity room and exam room, students train the dogs to walk next to simulated patients’ wheelchairs, sit by patients’ beds and provide them with affectionate and nurturing companionship.
Finally, the course instructs students on how to apply for grants for nonprofits, with the idea being to secure funding to support animal shelters.
Why is this course relevant now?
This course creates a collaborative and reciprocal partnership between a university and the community in which it is located. Focusing on the care for shelter dogs, it allows for faculty, students and a shelter’s staff and volunteers to exchange knowledge and resources. As such, it uses an instructional approach known as community engagement.
What’s a critical lesson from the course?
Working alongside our animal shelter community partners, and under the direction of my co-instructor, talented dog trainer Megan Mills, students learn that they can make a true and visible impact on society, one dog at a time.
What materials does the course feature?
Michael Domjan’s “The Principles of Learning and Behavior”
Cynthia K. Chandler’s “Animal-Assisted Therapy in Counseling”
“Handbook on Animal-Assisted Therapy,” edited by Aubrey H. Fine
What will the course prepare students to do?
Students will learn to use psychological learning principles to work effectively with shelter dogs – and this knowledge can later be translated to other domains of their lives. I believe that by training shelter dogs and learning to write nonprofit grant proposals, my students will develop into ethical and responsible citizens – both locally and globally.",Canines go to college in this class that seeks to give shelter dogs a fresh start,education
"As another school year approaches, some caregivers, students and teachers may be feeling something new needs to happen to promote success in the classroom.
Daily report cards can be a great starting point.
As a clinical psychologist who studies how schools can help students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, I know traditional report cards distributed three or four times per year don’t do enough to make a difference for children who are prone to outbursts or other challenging behaviors.
Studies conducted by my team and others support the idea that these students are better served by daily report cards.
Track daily progress
Daily report cards date back at least to the 1960s, when they were used in a study involving children attending a special education summer school.
Today they are commonly used for children with ADHD in both general education and special education classrooms. Daily report cards have also been used for students with autism without intellectual disability. And one study found that many teachers say they use versions of a daily report card for brief periods to address behaviors across many different school situations.
A daily report card can be very easy for teachers to create and use, either with an app or by developing them on their own. First, the teacher along with others – who may include the parents, principal, school psychologist or counselor, and even the child if appropriate – should meet to establish goals. Goals should be positively phrased, such as: “Completed work within time given” or “Participated in class discussions without interruption.”
Once set up, the daily report card can take just 10 seconds to complete. The time savings are significant when one considers the alternatives typically used in schools, such as repeated redirection or reprimanding, or sending the student to the principal’s office to be monitored.
Daily report cards also work.
A 2010 study evaluated children with ADHD where half had a daily report card and half did not. Those with the daily report card had an average of 4.5 fewer rule violations per 30-minute class than those without one. Extrapolating across a school day, that is 54 fewer daily rule violations on average, and over 10,000 per school year.
An example of a daily report card. Florida International University Center for Children and Families
Realistic goals
For many children with challenging behaviors, it is important to set goals that can be easily reached – at least at first.
Over time, the goals can be made more challenging as the child experiences success – a process called shaping. For example, if a child interrupts a lesson by calling out about five times per class, the initial goal may be set at “Participates in lesson with no more than four interruptions.”
This would represent an improvement, and it would also ensure the goal was reachable. Once the child met the goal for three to five days in a row, the goal could be changed to “Participates in lesson with no more than three interruptions.”
Positive parent-teacher communications
Teachers tend to communicate with caregivers more frequently when a child is experiencing difficulties in the classroom. But these communications often focus on negative behaviors. As a result, they can strain relationships between the caregiver and the teacher. Other times, it may result in the caregiver’s avoiding communication with the school.
Daily report cards can result in more positive and solution-focused communication instead of reports focusing only on what went wrong and can therefore enhance caregiver-teacher communication.
Motivating rewards
Importantly, the daily report card should be linked to home-based privileges and rewards so that children are motivated to meet daily goals.
At the end of the day, the child brings their daily report card home and, based on their behavior at school that day, home privileges such as an allotment of screen time or a slightly later bedtime can be used as rewards.
Importantly, this is not a punishment program in which a child loses privileges if goals are not met. It also is not bribing the child by providing a reward before an appropriate behavior is completed. Rather, the child starts the day without home privileges and earns them based on positive school behavior. The daily report card tells the child exactly what goals need to be met to earn the motivating privileges. This small difference can be quite powerful for the child because it puts them in charge of how they earn access to things they like to do at home based on how they behaved at school that day.
Evidence suggests this home-based reward system is one of the biggest factors in whether the daily report card is successful. It also provides a new opportunity for the child and caregiver to have a positive discussion about school each day.
Better than medication?
There is also evidence that the daily report card is a cost-effective approach for children with ADHD as an alternative to medication treatment.
My colleagues and I conducted a study in which children with ADHD were randomly assigned to start the school year with either medication or a daily report card. The parents of those assigned the daily report cards took part in classes that taught them how to provide home rewards for it. At the end of the year, the students who started with the daily report card had half as many discipline referrals and 33% fewer disruptive behaviors observed in the classroom than the students receiving medication. The daily report card approach also cost less than daily medication. The students who started the school year with the daily report card had overall treatment costs of US$708 less than the students starting with medication.
Teachers and caregivers who want to learn more about daily reports cards can check out the downloadable workbook or free app designed by my colleagues at Florida International University’s Center for Children and Families. Both resources allow caregivers and teachers to set goals and track a student’s progress. Starting the school year with a daily report card should help the child achieve the positive days needed to get a good grade on their report card at the end of the grading period.",Daily report cards can decrease disruptions for children with ADHD,education
"The state of Florida ignited a controversy when it released a set of 2023 academic standards that require fifth graders to be taught that enslaved Black people in the U.S. “developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their benefit.”
As a researcher specializing in the history of race and racism in the U.S., I – like a growing chorus of critics – see that education standard as flawed and misleading.
Whereas Florida would have students believe that enslaved Black people “benefited” by developing skills during slavery, the reality is that enslaved Africans contributed to the nation’s social, cultural and economic well-being by using skills they had already developed before captivity. What follows are examples of the skills the Africans brought with them as they entered the Americas as enslaved:
1. As farmers
During the period between 1750 and 1775, the majority of the enslaved Africans that landed in the Carolinas came from the traditional rice-growing regions in Africa known as the Rice Coast.
Subsequently, rice joined cotton as one of the most profitable agricultural products, not only in North Carolina and South Carolina but in Virginia and Georgia as well.
Other African food staples, such as black rice, okra, black-eyed peas, yams, peanuts and watermelon, made their way into North America via slave ship cargoes.
Ship captains relied on African agricultural products to feed the 12 million enslaved Africans transported to the Americas through a brutal voyage known as the Middle Passage. In some cases the Africans stowed away food as they boarded the ships. These foods were essential for the enslaved to survive the harsh conditions of their trans-Atlantic trip in the hulls of ships.
Once on plantations in the land now known as the United States, enslaved people occasionally were able to cultivate small gardens. In these gardens, reflecting a small amount of freedom, enslaved men and women grew their own food. Some of the crops consisted of produce originating in Africa. From these they added unique ingredients, such as hot peppers, peanuts, okra and greens, to adapt West African stews into gumbo or jambalaya, which took rice, spices and heavily seasoned vegetables and meat. These dishes soon became staples in what would become known as down-home cooking. Crop surpluses from the communal gardens were sometimes sold in local markets, thus providing income that some enslaved people used to purchase freedom. Some of these African-derived crops became central to Southern cuisine.

2. As cooks and chefs
The culinary skills that the West Africans brought with them served to enhance, transform and produce unique eating habits and culinary practices in the South. Although enslaved Africans were forced to cook for families that held them as property, they also cooked for themselves, typically using a large pot that they had been given for the purpose.
Using skills from various West African cultures, these cooks often worked together to prepare communal meals for their fellow enslaved people. The different cooking styles produced a range of popular meals centering on one-pot cooking to include stews or gumbos, or layering meat with greens. The meals comprised a high proportion of corn meal, animal fat and bits of meat or vegetables. Communal gardens, maintained by the enslaved, might supplement the meager supplies and what was available from hunting or fishing. Some of the cooks who emerged from these conditions became some of the highest regarded and valued among the enslaved in the regions.
Enslaved chefs blended African, Native American and European traditions to create unique Southern cuisines that featured roasted beef, veal, turkey, duck, fowl and ham. Desserts and puddings featured jellies, oranges, apples, nuts, figs and raisins. Stews and soups changed, given the season, sometimes featuring oysters or fish.
3. As artisans and builders
Slave ship manifests reveal that enslaved Africans included some who were woodcarvers and metalworkers. Others were skilled in various traditional crafts, including pottery making, weaving, basketry and wood carving. These crafts were instrumental in filling the perpetual scarcity of skilled labor on plantations.
When planters and traders considered purchasing an enslaved Black person, one of the key factors influencing their decision and the price was their skills. Slave auction sales included carpenters, blacksmiths and shoemakers.
Architectural designs showing West African influences have been identified in structures excavated from some colonial plantations in various areas of the South Carolina Lowcountry. These buildings, with clay-walled architecture, demonstrate that the West Africans came with building skills. Excavated clay pipes in the Chesapeake region reveal West African pottery decorative techniques.
Across the nation, multiple landmarks were built by the enslaved. These include the White House, the U.S. Capitol and the Smithsonian Castle in Washington, Fraunces Tavern and Wall Street in New York, and Fort Sumter in South Carolina.

4. As midwives, herbalists and healers
As Africans entered the Americas, they brought knowledge of medicinal plants. Some enslaved women were midwives who used medical practices and skills from their native lands. In many cases, while many of these plants were unavailable in the Americas, enslaved Africans’ knowledge, and that gleaned from Native Americans, helped them to identify a range of plants that could be beneficial to treat a wide range of illnesses among both the enslaved and the enslavers. Enslaved midwives delivered babies and, in some cases, provided the means for either avoiding pregnancies or performing abortions. They also treated respiratory illnesses.
These practices and knowledge grew as they began incorporating techniques from Native American and European sources. They employed an interesting array of these practices to identify herbs, produce devices and to facilitate childbirth and maternal health and well-being. They utilized several herbal remedies such as cedar berries, tansy and cotton seeds to end pregnancies.
In 1721, of the 5,880 Bostonians who contracted smallpox, 844 died. Even more would have died had it not been for a radical technique introduced by an enslaved person named Onesimus, who is credited with helping a small portion of the population survive.
Onesimus, purchased by Cotton Mather in 1706, was being groomed to be a domestic servant. In 1716, Onesimus informed Mather that he had survived smallpox and no longer feared contagion. He described a practice known as variolation derived by West Africans to fight various infections.
This was a method of intentionally infecting an individual by rubbing pus from an infected person into an open wound. Onesimus explained how this treatment resulted in significantly milder symptoms, eliminating the likelihood of contracting the disease. As physicians began to wonder about this mysterious method to prevent smallpox, they developed the technique known as vaccinations. Smallpox today has been eradicated worldwide primarily because of the medical advice rendered by Onesimus.

"Every day of the northern hemisphere’s summer in 2023 seems to bring a calamitous headline about the climate: heatwaves, wildfires, massive hailstorms.
Such scenes are set to become our global reality in the coming years. Scientists paint a grim picture of how human-induced climate change, combined with wider environmental degradation, will affect us all.
That, of course, includes children. However, research is still in its early stages on how, precisely, both climate change and environmental degradation relate to violence against children.
It is crucial to explore these potential intersections to spur academic and political movement in this area. Findings from such reviews, and further research that may emerge from it, could help to inform policies and interventions that can protect and support children, particularly those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and environmental shocks.
Our study
We conducted an extensive scoping review of the literature on the intersections of climate change, environmental degradation and violence against children, to see what’s known so far and what needs attention.
We explored both direct violence – physical, sexual and emotional – and structural violence; that is, rooted in inequitable and unjust systems and institutions. This approach allowed for a nuanced understanding of the implications for children in all countries. It also meant we could explore the causes and effects of climate change and environmental degradation in relation to systems, institutions, structures, norms and interactions.
The study identified five themes: hazards and disaster risk reduction; gender; climate-induced mobility or immobility; child labour; and health. What emerges clearly is that violence against children is not solely a phenomenon that intensifies during environmental shocks. It is deeply rooted in historical injustices, global systems and structures. That means it disproportionately affects those living in poverty.
1. Hazards and disaster risk reduction
Natural hazards, combined with large-scale humanitarian crises, pose immediate risks to health, life, property and the environment.
Studies have uncovered how increasing social, economic and emotional pressures in these situations expose children to higher risks of violence. This may occur in their homes or in relief shelters. It may be perpetrated by their peers, or by caregivers forcing them into labour because of the sudden need to rebuild or help make ends meet.
More knowledge is needed to inform integrated and culturally sensitive plans to protect children better from environmental hazards.
2. Gender
The effects of climate change and environmental degradation are not gender neutral. They can affect girls and boys differently. There is a growing body of work on gender-based violence and violence against women and girls in relation to climate change.
But this work tends to be centred on issues affecting female adults, conflating the term “gender” with “women”, without sufficient attention to the gendered effects of climate change on female and male children.
Existing research suggests that climate change can potentially exacerbate known drivers of child marriage in low- and lower-middle-income countries. But findings vary significantly by region. For example, there is an observed increase in child marriage motivated by the receipt of a bride price payment in sub-Saharan Africa during sudden periods of drought. In India, though, droughts have led to a decrease in child marriage to delay dowry payments.
Nuanced data about boys’ exposure to various forms of violence in the context of climate change is missing. That’s because studies tend to focus on males as perpetrators but not as victims of violence.
3. Mobility and immobility
The number of climate migrants is rising.
Research we reviewed on migration, displacement and relocation due to climate change, natural or human-induced hazards points to increased risks of violence against children within migrating families and higher exposure to it in camps and shelters. Also, separation from families or caregivers renders children and young people extremely vulnerable to violence.
Read more: Climate change, migration and urbanisation: patterns in sub-Saharan Africa
Meanwhile, immobility – when people cannot or do not want to move – has been associated in some studies with child abuse, injuries and overcrowding in slum areas.
Fear of violence in shelters can lead women to remain at home after natural hazards, increasing children’s risk of harm from the hazard or other forms of violence.
4. Child labour
Existing research indicates that child labour increases after natural hazards due to families’ reliance on child work and the absence of strategies to eliminate child labour entirely. Child labour is also prevalent in industries associated with climate change, such as agriculture, fisheries, mining, fashion and tourism.
The extent of child labour in this context, and its link to violence, remains inadequately explored in research, however, due to the hidden nature and contextual specificity of this issue.
5. Health
Children’s physical and mental health is affected by climate change. Natural hazards have been linked to poor health outcomes and increased mortality among children, particularly those younger than five.
There is emerging evidence that mental health issues, stemming from climate and environmental shocks, can lead to increased perpetration of violence against children, including domestic violence. Rising eco-anxiety among children and youth, caused by awareness of climate change and environmental degradation and fears of its consequences, adds to mental health problems.
Ways forward
By shedding light on the magnitude and pathways of these relationships, we want to underscore the urgent need for context-specific approaches and further research.
Understanding these interlinkages is essential for informing policies and interventions that can protect and support children, particularly those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and environmental shocks. By addressing the root causes of violence and prioritising the wellbeing of children in these crises, we can strive towards a safer and more sustainable future.",Climate change contributes to violence against children – here’s how,environment + energy
"How do you gauge whether someone is educated or not? In many parts of the world, the answer relates to the level of formal qualifications they achieve when they are young – do they have a university degree? In what subject and from what institution?
This appeals to the sense that education is something earned and to the belief that schools and universities have the authority to say who is (and who is not) educated. It’s also how economists and social scientists define someone’s education level and link that to what their health and social outcomes might be later in life.
However, as journalist Vanessa Friedman has written in the New York Times, educational status can change because of the clothes you wear. She uses two examples – a jacket worn by the fictional protagonist of the 1999 film The Talented Mr Ripley and the outfits worn by disgraced US politician George Santos, a look she calls the “uniform of preppy private-school boys everywhere”. He worked hard, she argues, to appear more credentialed than he was.
These characters, one fictional and one real, are con artists. But they make an important point about the way being educated is not a settled status. It is something that can be worked on in various ways, including through the clothes one wears.
We are researchers involved in a project exploring young people’s futures in rural Uganda. As part of this, Ben – an anthropologist – conducted a study to understand what young men and women do with their education in the absence of white collar jobs.
We found many women and men, of different ages, continuing to work on their claims to an educated identity throughout their lives. They do this by wearing the right clothes, but also by joining committees, being active in church, speaking what is considered the right sort of English, and presenting their arguments in the “logical” way that those with a good education have been trained in.
These people are not Tom Ripleys or George Santoses. They are doing what they do because being seen as educated has benefits. In this part of Uganda, educated people tend to prevail in disputes and fare better with various authorities; they are also more likely to benefit from government and NGO schemes.
This shows that people can work on their educational status throughout life, and that much of the work of being educated is only indirectly tied to the schooling experience. Policymakers miss this point. They assume that formal qualifications are the best measure of educational status. But “being educated” is not only about the credentials you have: it is also about how others credential you.
Ivan and Florence
Oledai is a rural sub-parish of about 180 households near the trading centre of Ngora, in eastern Uganda. Though English is the language of instruction from the late stages of primary school, Ateso is the most spoken language. Residents engage in a mix of farm work and petty trading; some run businesses to make a living. A small number have salaried employment, typically as school teachers.
There is a difference in how young and older people work on their educational status that reflects the fact that very few older people had the opportunity to go to secondary school.
If you ask a resident in the village to take you to the home of an educated person, you might we be directed to Ivan Onai’s grass thatched house. Ivan is in his late 20s; a born-again Christian who is fluent in English. He listens to the BBC World Service to cultivate his vocabulary.
Always well turned out, Ivan serves as a youth counsellor at the sub-county and runs a youth group in the village. Though Ivan dropped out of school after his A-levels, he has cultivated the identity of a university graduate through his manners, political career and committee work. Many feel he is more educated than some of his better-credentialed peers.
Florence Akol, meanwhile, is in her early 40s and went to school at a time when educating daughters was less of a priority in Uganda than it is today. She completed only two years of primary education, but went on to raise two daughters who both attended university. Through them she has learned English. She is also treasurer of the village council and treasurer of her clan.
These stories illustrate how schools and universities throughout Uganda are important not only as places where certificates are handed out but also as referents against which ideas of “being educated” circulate more widely in society.
The experience of schooling matters as much as the practices it teaches – committee skills, competence in English, the carrying of books and pens. Committee work requires an understanding of procedure, an ability to do bookwork and, often, a degree of confidence in spoken English.
The benefit of perceptions
The wider community often discussed what made someone educated. One older woman, part of a group trying to raise money for school fees, told us that education “trims your manners and helps you think differently” and that “being educated” helped in managing disputes and getting a favourable outcome in the village court.
Women in Oledai reflect on what it means to be ‘educated’. Ben Jones
This could be observed as the community mobilised around the “parish fund”, a new government initiative meant to help its citizens, or the president’s Emyooga scheme targeting youth. Those appointed to positions of influence were more educated than the average, and those in committee positions had the capacity to monopolise how the funds would be allocated.
Policy implications
We believe that understanding these dynamics is key for policymakers and researchers, who (in Uganda and many other parts of the continent) define educational status through the formal qualifications a person has. They focus on the health or social benefits that come from “human capital”.
We would encourage policymakers to rethink how education is understood so that it comes to be defined as an accredited status – how people evaluate you – as well as a credentialed one – the papers you carry in your pocket.
Investing in areas that shape accreditation would be a way of helping more people access opportunities. In Oledai this might mean offering evening classes to help adults improve their skills in spoken English, or giving people access to training in the sort of bookwork that committees value.",What does it mean to be ‘educated’?

"South Africa has a growing unemployment rate. Statistics show the unemployment rate to be above 60% for those aged 15-24 and over 40% for those aged 25-34 years. Rankings from the World Bank position South Africa as having the highest unemployment rate in the world.
This runaway unemployment rate not only creates precarious, limiting circumstances for individual young people but also poses a threat to the country’s economic growth and global competitiveness.
Another, much more positive statistic from the International Telecommunications Union positions young people as active adopters of technology. Three-quarters of 15- to 24-year-olds globally use the internet actively. Though the figures show this uptake to be mostly in developed countries, there is progress on the African continent in terms of technology infrastructure to lead to internet usage.
These developments are also noted in South Africa. The country’s internet penetration rate stood at 72.3% of the total population at the start of 2023. This paves the way for greater use of social media.
Our interest as researchers is how young people can use social media to overcome the unemployment challenge in South Africa.
A study we carried out found three key ways for young people to enhance their employability using social media. Our findings, like those of some other studies, place high importance on the role of social media in a context of high unemployment.
For the study, we interviewed 15 human resources specialists whose work largely focused on recruitment and selection. They help some of South Africa’s leading corporate companies to find the best candidates for certain roles. These were their three key pieces of advice.
1. Using social media to edify a personal brand
All the interviewees in our study agreed that social media could be used to edify an individual’s brand. This is something that is becoming common and encouraged globally.
The aim here is clear: through your social media activity you convey a message about yourself. This can be useful to reach out to the outside world in advertising your skills set. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn are a valuable resource for young jobseekers to achieve this.
2. Using social media to widen your networks
Once young people have an idea of what their online “brand” will be, they can start to network. This may be with other jobseekers or prospective employers. Networking offers an opportunity to learn about the world of work, including the challenging labour market. Using information from networking, young people can be better equipped to respond to uncertainty.
Networking on social media platforms could involve attending webinars and discussion forums. A number of social media platforms offer tools enabling interaction through text, audio or video. One participant in our research described the strength of networking like this:
Networking allows you to build your social capital on two fronts. First, you get access to interact with important stakeholders such as prospective employers. Second … not only information but a learning space from the experience of others.
Interviewees warned that young jobseekers should not compromise their personal brand. One said:
Graduates should be warned about the kind of stuff they should and should not post on social media and ensure that their online media presence is closely monitored and updated so that they are aware of what others can see about them. Social media allows for quick and easy judgement-making …
Universities should consider offering social media and personal branding training awareness so that future graduates are not only aware of complexities in the labour market but also prepared to meet them. Graduate placement offices within universities could take on this training role.
3. Using social media as a platform for continued learning
Social media presents young people with an endless reservoir of information about the world. It includes job postings, learnership and internship opportunities, and tips on how to be marketable in an ever changing job market.
One participant in our study with experience recruiting in the technology sector expressed this view:
For any young person I would say continue to use social media as a fountain of learning. Learn about the world of work through social media. Importantly, also learn about yourself and how you could fit into such a world.
Tackling unemployment
Our research suggests that young people should learn how to search for job opportunities, and advertise their skills and profiles on social media. This can help them tap into a network that might give them a better chance in a situation of high unemployment.

"In many postcolonial contexts, early learning is conducted, and assessed, in a language that is unfamiliar to learners. About 40% of the world’s population cannot access schooling in a language that they understand and that is regularly used in their communities. This figure may be as high as 80% in sub-Saharan Africa.
Language policies in some countries preserve a role for mother tongue or other familiar local languages in the first years of schooling. This is the case for example in Kenya, Botswana and Ethiopia. In Tanzania, the national language – Kiswahili – is the language of instruction in primary schooling. The use of Kiswahili at this level was seen as integral to forging a new national Tanzanian identity after independence.
But nearly all countries switch to English, French or Portuguese by the start of secondary schooling.
Tanzania is no exception. Although there was a shift in the wording of the language policy in 2015, there was strong opposition to change. Young people continue to experience an abrupt transition to English when they enter Form 1 of secondary school from 14 years old.
There is clear evidence that the compulsory use of English makes learning more difficult and contributes to poor outcomes. Research has also found, however, that many students and teachers wanted to retain English as the language of instruction.
To try to unpick this perplexing confusion, I sought to explore students’ experiences of language in school, alongside their broader attitudes and aspirations relating to education and language. My study confirmed previous findings that compulsory use of English limits learner comprehension and participation. More significantly, I found that underlying student fear of poor expression in a new language – and being laughed at or mocked by teachers and fellow students – was a prevalent barrier to learning and participation.
The findings from this study are a clear pointer that any new approaches must include changes to classroom management. Laughter and humiliation should not be allowed as responses to mistakes.
The study
This study was conducted over eight months in two secondary schools in the Morogoro region of central Tanzania. The urban school had more than 1,500 students and included both lower and advanced secondary level, forms 1-6. The rural school was a newer, community school, with 600 students in forms 1-4. This study was designed for depth of understanding, so it focused on only two schools. There may be differences in learners’ experiences in different schools and regions across the country, but the challenges found in these two schools were similar to those reported in the wider literature.
The research approach was ethnographic – through observation in and out of class as well as formal and informal interviews with students and teachers. During this research, young people were free to speak Kiswahili, English or a mix of these two. Although there were other local languages used in the communities, they were not widely used in school. This is perhaps different in other regions of the country where there is a more dominant local language.
I trained and worked with a group of pupil researchers from the two schools. They conducted their own interviews, co-facilitated workshops and helped to interpret the findings and explain their meaning in the Tanzanian context. I wanted to recognise the importance of their accounts and explanations.
What we found
The vast majority of pupils in this study had not used English as a language of instruction before starting secondary school at age 14 or above. They also had limited exposure to English outside school. Only a small number of pupils at the urban school had attended private, English-medium primary schools.
To enable learners to understand, most teachers translated lesson content into Kiswahili. This happens elsewhere too, but it is much less common for teachers to allow students to answer questions in a familiar language. In this study I observed learners asking to speak in Kiswahili and being told that this was not permitted. Students had to translate their knowledge into English to respond.
Many students explained that they preferred to remain silent. This is because if they tried to answer and failed to express themselves, they risked being laughed at and perceived as unintelligent by their teachers and classmates. A female Form 2 student in the urban school said:
You will be laughed at, which means we are afraid of the shame … fear, again.
Students’ fears were not unfounded. I recorded many instances of laughter punctuating student responses in class. These include some which were led by teachers who seemed to be using humiliation and fear of failure as strategies to motivate learners to work harder. In some cases, threats of physical punishment were also used against students who were unable to complete a task.
This study found that girls were particularly worried about cruel comments from other girls that they termed “gossiping”. Learners’ experiences of negative emotions may differ based on gender but this was not the focus of my study.
Conclusion
Requiring young students to use an unfamiliar language to participate in learning works against the global aspirations for inclusive and equitable quality education. In Tanzania and other sub-Saharan African countries, some important work is being done with local teachers and teacher educators to develop multilingual, translingual and language supportive approaches to teaching.
The key feature is the use of a familiar language for exploratory discussion and to support learning of both subject content and the target language. Currently on a small scale, it is happening in a several countries, including Tanzania, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Research is also under way to explore opportunities for expanding to a larger scale.

"The latest fighting to erupt in Sudan has plunged the nation into a fresh crisis. Since 15 April, conflict between the Sudan Armed Forces and the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces has left nearly 800 people dead and forced about a million others to seek sanctuary abroad. It has disrupted daily life, destroyed property and shut down universities.
It is adult military generals who have created this political abyss. I believe that the country’s young people – particularly its university students – symbolise Sudan’s hopes of reconstructing its future.
I am an academic researching higher education, education in post-conflict contexts and comparative national systems of education. I have also served in government in South Sudan, as the director general for universities in the Ministry of Higher Education. As such, and given my own experiences as a student activist, I have a deep interest in the role of university students in Sudan.
It would not be the first time that university students have come to the forefront to drive political change. They have done so four times before: once in the struggle to gain independence from colonial Britain in 1956 and thrice as the Sudanese people stood up to military regimes – in 1964, 1985 and 2019.
Sudan’s university students have not only spearheaded revolutions. They also contributed to a thriving campus culture that has given voice to multiple political views, ethnicities and religious beliefs. No matter the students’ individual differences, the four uprisings I discuss here were driven by something they had in common: the desire for Sudan to be democratically ruled.
Liberation struggles
Universities play various societal roles. In Sudan, tertiary institutions have historically had two main functions. First, as with any other African country immediately after colonial rule ended, they are responsible for socio-economic development. They supply both the private and public labour forces. Civil servants were particularly important immediately after the British ceded control.
Second, Sudan’s university students have played a key role in liberation struggles.
The Graduates General Congress began its life in the 1940s as an association for alumni of Gordon Memorial College. This institution would ultimately become the University of Khartoum, located in Sudan’s capital city.
The congress’s members articulated calls for independence. They galvanised many other Sudanese to push for the withdrawal of the British colonial state.
After independence, universities in Sudan continued on the same political path. Students led three popular uprisings that toppled military dictatorships and restored civilian and democratic rule.
University of Khartoum students organised and drove the October 1964 revolution. This ended General Ibrahim Abboud’s eight-year presidency. Students – including myself, an undergraduate at the time – were also key players in 1985, when protests and a civil disobedience campaign deposed president Jaafar Mohammed Numeiri.
Most recently, university students and academics were at the forefront of the popular uprising in 2019 that ended Omar al-Bashir’s rule after 30 years.

Khartoum at the centre
The University of Khartoum, in various iterations, has been central to all these protests. The institution was originally a satellite college of the University of London. It was established as a public university at independence in 1956.
Two other regional universities, Gezira and Juba (in what is today the capital of South Sudan), were opened in the 1970s. The 1990s saw what scholars have called the “higher education revolution”, when the growing demand for tertiary education led to 26 new institutions being created in 1991 alone.
Most of these universities are in Khartoum. This geographical concentration consolidates students’ power. It means they are physically well placed to collaborate and coordinate with other powerful groupings in society, like trade unions, to push for political change.
Other tertiary institutions in Khartoum are influenced by the University of Khartoum’s political and social activism. They have emerged as melting pots in an ethnically and linguistically diverse nation. For many students, particularly those from the periphery like Darfur in the far west, the former southern Sudan, the easterners and the Nubians in the far north, university campuses provide the first meeting point with those of other backgrounds.
When I spend time on Sudanese university campuses, I frequently overhear ideological and political debates. These thrive side by side with academic work.
What next?
It is not clear what lies ahead for Sudan. But if history is any indication, university students will be at the heart of civilian resistance – and could once again play a crucial role in pushing for democracy.",Sudan’s university students have a long history of political activism,education
"Most philosophers of education or philosophically inclined scholars of education in the past century and a half would agree with the claim that, ideally, education should be the practice of freedom. That is, it ought to cultivate the ability to intelligently decide how we want to shape our lives. The aim of education should be to foster human autonomy.
I’m thinking here of a diverse array of scholars. Among them are some of the most influential philosophers of education and educational theorists of the 20th century: the American John Dewey, Brazilian Paulo Freire and Indian Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore.
Yet there’s little evidence that their views have played any significant role in shaping the global contemporary education sector, including the tertiary sector.
If these scholars are correct, universities and educational institutions too often don’t understand what they are doing. It’s a shocking indictment on the higher education sector. After all, educational institutions are in the business (or should be) of fostering understanding.
I am the director of the Allan Gray Centre for Leadership Ethics, located in Rhodes University’s Department of Philosophy in South Africa. I have for many years been trying to make sense of education’s purpose and wondering why there is such a great discrepancy between what scholars of education have been telling us and what happens in the classroom.
What the big thinkers have had to say
The aforementioned authors believe that education should help to shape well-adjusted individuals who can contribute to the common good – as opposed to merely lending a hand to what is already there. Merely lending a hand is expressive of a limited understanding of the norms guiding professional work, and hence distorts autonomy.
Dewey thought that education should promote “intelligent growth”, the sort that defines an autonomous agent. In Dewey’s own words:
Impulses and desires that are not ordered by intelligence are under the control of accidental circumstances. It may be a loss rather than a gain to escape from the control of another person only to find one’s conduct dictated by immediate whim and caprice; that is, at the mercy of impulses into whose formation intelligent judgement has not entered. A person whose conduct is controlled in this way has at most only the illusion of freedom. Actually he is directed by forces over which he has no command.
An educated person can adapt to life’s challenges by critically and sensitively engaging with what is given. The alternative is what Dewey describes as someone “whose conduct is controlled … by forces over which he has no command” and hence lacks freedom. This is a subject who is unable to develop a proper understanding of the forces that undermine freedom.
Sadly, it is this sort of existence that very many contemporary universities promote. Universities aim to produce efficient professionals rather than autonomous agents who are able to adapt to life’s challenges and understand the forces that impinge on their formation.
The reality
Universities follow on from primary and secondary education by training students to be uncritical servants of the status quo, to apply their intelligence in specific spheres of life and not to ask too many questions beyond the narrow scope of their engagements.
It is this approach that the American philosopher and linguist Noam Chomsky describes in an interview when speaking about the contrast between indoctrination and genuine education.
This sort of narrowly circumscribed thinking lacks the expansiveness of the critical mind – a mind able to stand back, consider and influence autonomous action.
Intellectual subordination
In an interview which forms part of the 2012 documentary The Lottery of Birth, Jeff Schmidt, a physicist and the author of Disciplined Minds: A Critical Look at Salaried Professionals and the Soul-battering System That Shapes Their Lives, says:
Professionals are deliberately produced to be intellectually and politically subordinate.
He illustrates this idea with the anecdote of two young nuclear weapons designers working in a nuclear weapons design laboratory. When asked by a journalist what the worst part of their job was, they rejoined that it was dealing with unstable computers lacking sufficient capacity.
They were not, it seems, able to consider the higher purposes they were blindly serving. The scope of their concerns was subordinated to the aims of others in power – their employers.
Education as freedom
There are ways in which this approach to education can be challenged. For instance, at the Allan Gray Centre for Leadership Ethics, we’ve developed a programme called IiNtetho zoBomi (isiXhosa for “conversations about life”).
It aims to complement the current university offering to foster the educational ideals propounded by the scholars I’ve discussed here. Service-learning activities are a core part of the programme. Students are encouraged to take the course only if they are interested in “understanding how your life – including your inner life – is formed by the world you inhabit”.
Is it working? I hope so. But the growth we aim to foster is hard to measure.
What I can confidently say, however, is that the effect of such programmes at any university would be far greater if there was more institutional buy-in than there currently is.
The idea that education is the practice of freedom cannot be separated from the idea that education should aim to equip students to critically and creatively engage with reality to transform it for the better.",It’s important to rethink the purpose of university education – a philosopher of education explains why,education
"Kunyashe is a Grade 1 pupil in Cape Town, South Africa. She’s very focused on her schoolwork. She shares a tiny one-roomed shack, hardly bigger than a double bed, with her mother and four siblings. Kunyashe receives a meal at school – her teacher once saw the little girl spooning some of this meal into another container to take home for her baby brother.
This is the context in which many South African children learn to read. But it’s a context that received no mention when the country’s Department of Basic Education, on 16 May, released the alarming preliminary findings of the Progress in Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS 2021).
The international standardised test measures the reading achievement of Grade 4 children (10 years old). It is designed to measure children’s “reading literacy” and to provide a baseline for future studies of trends in achievement. The headline finding was grim: “81% of South African children in Grade 4 cannot read for meaning”.
There is no denying that there is a literacy crisis in South African schools. The problem is that official discourses present it as something that occurs in a social vacuum and can be solved by technicist approaches.
It isn’t. The political and economic dimensions of the problem are deeply entangled with the glaring inequalities in South Africa.
We are literacy and language education experts, and members of the bua-lit collective advocating for quality education for children who speak African languages. Based on our research and ongoing work in classrooms across South Africa, we’ve identified five practices we believe will promote “rich literacies”. This approach involves a wider understanding of literacy in which children are engaged with reading and writing texts that come from their worlds and that have meaning for them.
A poverty of literacy
The daily lives of most children in South Africa are fraught with poverty, hunger and uncertainty.
Two-thirds of these children from poorer backgrounds attend no fee schools. Sadly, they also receive a poverty of literacy teaching and materials. The current dominant process is based on the contested “Science of Reading” method. In this approach children are largely given access to basic atomised skills: sounding out letters (phonics), followed by lockstep reading of words with the emphasis on fluency, accuracy and speed. Reading authentic books with plots and illustrations is seen as harmful or needing to be delayed until children are able to efficiently decode words.
Teachers are trained to teach using “graded readers” – simplified texts repeating the same vocabulary – together with alphabet charts, friezes and flashcards and are discouraged from telling stories, using real books to read for enjoyment or writing with children.
This approach lends itself well to highly technicist interventions that are easy to implement. But it misses the crucial point that children need to be highly motivated to learn to read and write. In order to read for meaning they must be motivated to make meaning. It also misses the point that reading and writing are not just cognitive skills – they are socially shared and shaped practices.
In contrast to the poverty of literacy imposed on poor children, middle-class children in well and over-resourced schools are given plenty of opportunities at school and at home to engage in pleasurable, motivating and meaningful ways with high quality books as well as to express themselves through writing. This is in addition to school-based phonics programmes and graded readers.
A further problem in enabling children to become successful readers and writers lies in South Africa’s language in education policies and the way they have been implemented in schools.

The majority of African language speaking children in South Africa learn in their home language for the first three years and then switch to learning in English in Grade 4. Children have hardly had the opportunity to establish literacy skills in their home language when they are forced to learn in and through English.
Five practices
We believe that there are no quick fixes to the impoverishment of literacy learning for poor children in South Africa resulting from the legacies of colonialism and apartheid and now compounded by beliefs in technicist solutions.
Rather we outline five practices that could make an immediate start in providing literacy teaching that enriches children’s literacy lives.
Every foundation phase classroom should have living libraries that include enjoyable, quality, illustrated published stories and non-fiction books in children’s most familiar languages as well as English; and that include books made by children with each other and the teacher in the classroom. Children must take at least one book home every day.
There should be dedicated time every day for teachers to read aloud and talk to pupils about interesting fiction and non-fiction books.
Teachers should dedicate time each day to engage in shared writing with children of texts about topics that they are interested in that draw on wide background knowledge and that have a purpose.
In addition to the dedicated time every day to teach explicit literacy skills and knowledge like phonics (letter sound-relationships) the basic skills also need to develop understandings of text structure/genre for different kinds of text: how stories start; develop and end; the parts of a recipe: ingredients and methods; and the mechanics of writing (use of punctuation, spelling, handwriting).
These four activities need to be supported by both pre-service and ongoing teacher training. Literacy coaches can also become a resource to support teachers.
The wider community has a role to play, too. This could be in the form of after-school and/or holiday literacy clubs. Here children engage with rich literacies in a range of fun activities such as sharing stories through oral storytelling and story-reading; hearing from published authors, singing and playing games. In school, retired teachers, grandparents and unemployed parents and youth, after some training, can assist teachers in classrooms and work in small groups with children.
Rich literacies require a multi-pronged approach which views literacy in its wider context and which engages a diversity of practices, programmes and opportunities.",South Africa’s reading crisis: 5 steps to address children’s literacy struggles,education
"How much time did your child spend looking at a screen today?
The answer likely depends on how old they are, what grade they’re in at school and what rules you have in place at home about screen time. But the reality is that, for children and adolescents growing up as “digital natives”, it is almost impossible to imagine life without screens of some sort.
Devices like cellphones, laptops and tablets have become ubiquitous as tools for entertainment and education in most parts of the world. This has led parents, guardians, teachers and researchers to wonder whether screens are good or bad for children.
The World Health Organization recommends that school-going children (five-17 years) limit their recreational screen time. The recommendation for two to four year-olds is not more than one hour of screen time per day (less is better); it suggests that children younger than two should have no screen time. Research evidence suggests that children and adolescents were already exceeding these recommendations, and that the COVID-19 pandemic only made this worse.
There isn’t yet conclusive evidence about whether screen time is good or bad for children. But, based on my ongoing research into children’s development – including the role of play, sleep, physical movement and screen time – my view is that there are benefits of educational screen time, but we don’t know enough about the potential harms.
Nevertheless, there are several things parents and teachers can do. This includes basics such as being aware of how much time children are spending on screens and what their posture is like through, to more complex issues such as what each child’s developmental weaknesses and strengths are. It also involves setting boundaries.
None of this is easy to implement. However it doesn’t mean that they cannot be a healthy goal worth working towards. It is never too late to start, but the earlier you do, the better.
Covering the basics
First, it is essential for parents to be aware about how screen-based activities (educational and recreational) influence their child’s development, as well as their behaviour.
Secondly, remember that all children are different and will therefore respond differently to screen time. So understanding the child and their strengths and weaknesses is key. For example, if a child struggles with managing sensory input – like loud noises, bright lights or certain textures – it may be better for them to avoid recreational screen time.

Thirdly, establish boundaries around screen time. This is key at home and at school.
Fourth, keep tabs on how screen time is stopping children from doing other things that are developmentally beneficial. For example, in the home, a child who is learning mostly on screens at school could be encouraged to spend time after school playing outside, and doing activities that develop fine motor skills. Screen swiping and typing are poor substitutes for activities that stimulate these skills, like writing, drawing, colouring in, painting, and cutting.
Fifth, in a school environment, are there other activities that provide children and adolescents opportunities to intentionally develop their social and emotional skills that are not getting as much attention when they are working alone on screens?
Sixth, are screens set up in such a way that encourages good posture?
Baby steps
Setting boundaries and striving for a healthy balance of educational and recreational screen time within the broader context of development may seem daunting.
It requires thoughtfully reflecting on the wider impacts of the choices made around screens, and offering a range of opportunities that help to boost chlidren’s chances of growing up to be healthy and well-adjusted adults.
As much as possible, involve children and adolescents in conversations about why a healthy balance of screen time will benefit them. This can help them take ownership of their choices about their health and development – both in the present as well as their future health and well-being.",Kids and screen time - an expert offers advice for parents and teachers,education
"Of all the debate over teaching U.S. slavery, it is one sentence of Florida’s revised academic standards that has provoked particular ire: “Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”
Does this sentence constitute “propaganda,” as Vice President Kamala Harris proclaimed, “an attempt to gaslight us?”
Or is it a reasonable claim in a discussion of a difficult topic?
Whatever it is, the sentence is of a sort not unique to the teaching of enslavement in Florida. It is, instead, an example of how some Americans transform the racist history of this country into an uplifting – and sanitized – moral lesson.
Truth or fiction?
In our view as cultural anthropologists, the disputed sentence is true as historians define facts – tiny nuggets of truth one can find in archives, artifacts and diaries.
It is a fact that small numbers of the enslaved acquired skills that allowed them to earn money, to save it and to buy their freedom and the freedom of family members.
It is also a fact that freed Black people in the antebellum era helped other Black people to also acquire skills and became part of a segregated Black middle class in many Southern cities.
One might argue that such a sentence, because it is true, should not give rise to protest. But as scholars who have studied how history is taught in America, we learned that this particular nugget is neither trivial nor insignificant.
Instead, the one sentence in Florida’s new standards allows Americans to transform a story about what we today call structural racism into an apocryphal story about Horatio Alger and America’s rags-to-riches melting pot.
As this line of thinking goes, enslaved ancestors of contemporary African Americans labored just as most contemporary Americans’ ancestors labored: at the bottom, but able to climb up the social ladder with hard work and discipline.
And this is the problem: To portray enslaved people as laborers like free laborers is exactly how not to teach about slavery.
But it is a commonly used method that is called a “switching mechanism.” In this example, the story about the horrors of the slave system is transformed into a story about opportunity, success and the American dream.
Switching the story at Colonial Williamsburg
Thirty years ago, when we conducted anthropological research at Colonial Williamsburg, we encountered the same narrative switching mechanism that is occurring now in Florida.
At that time, the world-famous Virginia outdoor history museum depicting a genteel, colonial America was trying to present the public with a truer picture of the past by incorporating the history of what they called “the Other Half” – the enslaved people who had been all but absent from the museum’s past portrayals.
In this 2001 photograph, Black ‘interpreters’ are acting as carpenters in Colonial Williamsburg. Education Images/Getty Images
But it was difficult, we found, for the museum to sustain a narrative about the evils of the slave system. That’s because much of its paying audience of white middle-class tourists did not want to dwell on such tales, and second, its “interpreters,” or guides, found ways to switch the narrative.
Starting from a story about the enslaved being someone else’s property, they would transition to one suggesting the enslaved were working for their own advancement.
We heard stories during our research like this:
• Don’t imagine that 18th century Williamsburg was like mid-19th century Mississippi cotton plantations, with families torn apart by avaricious masters, whippings, shackles and rape. Instead, in Williamsburg, slaves were valuable property.
• Consider that your average white yeoman farmer of the time had an annual income of about 20 pounds. Now consider that a highly trained slave cook was worth 500 pounds. Would your average owner be likely to abuse such a valuable piece of property? No! They’d treat that slave like an NFL quarterback!
Such stories conflated an enslaved laborer’s monetary value to his owner and the income of a white laborer. And that is how many visitors we listened to interpreted what they were hearing.
In other instances, we found conflicting messages.
In a skit that took us to the basement of an elite white Williamsburg household during Christmas, we witnessed Black interpreters portraying enslaved houseboys, maids and cooks complaining that they had to work harder than ever to create the festive atmosphere their owners desired. Meanwhile, upstairs, white interpreters portraying gentlemen conversing waxed philosophical about the evils of slavery coupled with the impossibility of getting rid of it.

At the conclusion of the story, we talked to two members of the audience who, it turns out, had learned different lessons.
One concluded that she had witnessed a universal story because workers everywhere grumble about their bosses. The other pointed out that if she disliked her boss, she could quit her job – something the enslaved couldn’t do.
Still, both were relieved to hear that slavery did not sit easy on the consciences of the white elite.
Structural inequality or Horatio Alger?
Switching mechanisms such as these are hard to dislodge. They remake the worst parts of the American story into a story consonant with the American Dream.
Today, not much has changed in Williamsburg. In Florida and many other states, switching allows designers of history curricula to avoid discussions on the lasting effects of racialized slave labor. They avoid discussing what that has meant to millions of people who did not, will not and cannot start on the same rung of the ladder of upward mobility that is available to other Americans who do not share a history of enslavement.
In our view, that is not a story that many Americans want to tell, teach or hear.
And so they switch to a different one, in which equal opportunity has been achieved, every one of us is capable of overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds, and failure to rise must be a result of individual weakness and vice.",Why separating fact from fiction is critical in teaching US slavery,education
"After Boitumelo gave birth she decided not to go back to school. She assumed that, because she was now a mother, she would be barred from returning. Then she had a surprising interaction:
They [school] were like, why did you not come back [to school], do you attend [school] elsewhere? I was like, no, I have a child. Then they were like, on January we need you here, this school is empty without you, and that gave me the confidence of saying, oh I must go back to school.
In fact, Boitumelo had the right, under South African law, to continue her schooling through and after her pregnancy – without fear of stigma or discrimination. But her experience of a supportive school environment is sadly all too rare. In early November 2022 a learner in the KwaZulu-Natal province was forced to take her school to court so she could sit for her final matriculation exams. She was expelled in July 2022 in accordance with the school’s “pregnancy policy.”
More than 100,000 adolescent girls give birth in South Africa each year. Adolescent births represented between 12 and 14% of births in facilities between 2019 and 2022. Specifically, the number of births delivered by adolescents aged between 10 and 19 in South Africa’s public health facilities rose from 129,223 in 2019 to 139,361 in 2022. This increase in the number of births is a setback when viewed against the modest progress made in lowering teenage pregnancy rates between 1998 and 2016.
Early, unintended pregnancy affects young women’s educational, health, social and economic futures. It can keep them from continuing or finishing school and thus from pursuing further education and training.
I wanted to know what influenced young women’s decisions about schooling when they found out they were pregnant. Some dropped out temporarily; some remained in school throughout their pregnancies and returned after giving birth. Others dropped out permanently.
My findings suggest that schools, families and the wider community play a critical role in determining what decision a young woman will make. Support and encouragement can keep them in school while stigmatisation and exclusion push them out entirely.
Support and childcare
For my study I conducted in-depth interviews with 30 young women in an urban community in South Africa; 24 were in school when they found out they were pregnant. Their ages ranged from 15 to 20 years. In all but one case, their pregnancies were unintended.
Thirteen of the participants had decided to remain at school upon finding out they were pregnant.
They experienced mixed reactions from the school management and teachers along a continuum of active support for them to continue school, to not acknowledging the pregnancy at all, to attempts to dismiss or shame them.
In one case a pregnant learner was told she had to leave school because it would not take responsibility for her health. Her mother challenged the school by arranging for an aunt to accompany the young woman to school every day to take responsibility for her health.
Being able to organise childcare for babies was an important determinant for remaining at school. The Child Support Grant, which currently amounts to R480 (about US$28) per month and is awarded through means testing, increased the agency of young mothers to find care for their babies in local creches or paid caregivers, especially in urban areas, where kin were not always available for childcare.
A further important determinant of remaining at school in spite of challenges experienced was the desire not to disappoint families who had made sacrifices to educate their daughters.
Making hard decisions
Another six of the participants temporarily dropped out of school. This was largely a result of school policy, shame and embarrassment about attending school while pregnant, and taking a break while coping with the onerous demands of pregnancy and motherhood.
The remaining five young women I interviewed permanently dropped out of school because of school policy, inability to manage the dual demands of motherhood and schooling, and lack of support to care for their babies. Their decision was strongly influenced by the reactions of family, partners and friends.
For example, Bontle was told by her mother that she had to take care of her “mistake” (baby) and therefore had to give up school:
I couldn’t go back (to school) because my mother said I should take care of the baby, no one’s going to take care of my baby because it is a choice that I made and I wanted to have a baby while I was still schooling.
These findings emphasise the critical role schools and the wider family and community play in determining young pregnant women’s decisions to continue and complete their schooling.
They also show how schools continue to exercise “policy” barring pregnant learners from school or shaming them in spite of this violating South Africa’s legal and constitutional framework.
Young pregnant women require support to advocate for their right to continue schooling and need care and support by family and community to make it easier to continue going to school.
Accountability and support
The Department of Basic Education must ensure that school management and governing bodies are well versed with policy around pregnant learners. Schools that violate the rights of pregnant learners must be held to account.
Individual schools need to strike a balance between treating pregnant learners like any other learner and accommodating their particular needs. Pregnant learners’ increased risk of dropping out of school should be seen within the broader package of care and support offered to vulnerable learners, and teachers should be trained to offer psychosocial and other support.
Schools can also link pregnant and parenting learners to health and social services; for example, ensuring that young mothers receive the Child Support Grant.",Pregnant learners in South Africa need creches and compassion to keep them in school,education
"After earning bachelor’s degrees in engineering and sociology, I was determined to do what I love. I headed straight to graduate school to investigate the social problems that frightened and fascinated me.
For almost a decade, I told everyone I encountered – students, cousins, baristas at the coffee shop I frequented – that they should do the same. “Follow your passion,” I counseled. “You can figure out the employment stuff later.”
It wasn’t until I began to research this widely accepted career advice that I understood how problematic – and rooted in privilege – it really was.
The passion principle
As a sociologist who examines workforce culture and inequalities, I interviewed college students and professional workers to learn what it really meant to pursue their dreams, which I will refer to here as the passion principle. I was stunned by what I found out about this principle in the research for my book “The Trouble with Passion.”
I examined surveys that show the American public has held the passion principle in high regard as a career decision-making priority since the 1980s. And its popularity is even stronger among those facing pandemic-related job instability.
My interviews revealed that proponents of the passion principle found it compelling because they believed that following one’s passion can provide workers with both the motivation necessary to work hard and a place to find fulfillment.
Yet, what I found is that following one’s passion does not necessarily lead to fulfillment, but is one of the most powerful cultural forces perpetuating overwork. I also found that promoting the pursuit of one’s passion helps perpetuate social inequalities due to the fact that not everyone has the same economic resources to allow them to pursue their passion with ease. What follows are five major pitfalls of the passion principle that I discovered through my research.
1. Reinforces social inequality
While the passion principle is broadly popular, not everyone has the necessary resources to turn their passion into a stable, good-paying job.
Passion-seekers from wealthy families are better able to wait until a job in their passion comes along without worrying about student loans in the meantime. They are also better situated to take unpaid internships to get their foot in the door while their parents pay their rent or let them live at home.
And they often have access to parents’ social networks to help them find jobs. Surveys revealed that working-class and first-generation college graduates, regardless of their career field, are more likely than their wealthier peers to end up in low-paying unskilled jobs when they pursue their passion.
Colleges and universities, workplaces and career counselors who promote the “follow your passion” path for everyone, without leveling the playing field, help perpetuate socioeconomic inequalities among career aspirants.
Thus, those who promote the “follow your passion” path for everyone might be ignoring the fact that not everyone is equally able to find success while following that advice.
2. A threat to well-being
My research revealed that passion proponents see the pursuit of one’s passion as a good way to decide on a career, not only because having work in one’s passion might lead to a good job, but because it is believed to lead to a good life. To achieve this, passion-seekers invest much of their own sense of identity in their work.
Yet, the labor force is not structured around the goal of nurturing our authentic sense of self. Indeed, studies of laid-off workers have illustrated that those who were passionate about their work felt as though they lost a part of their identity when they lost their jobs, along with their source of income.
When we rely on our jobs to give us a sense of purpose, we place our identities at the mercy of the global economy.
3. Promotes exploitation
It’s not just well-off passion-seekers who benefit from the passion principle. Employers of passionate workers do, too. I conducted an experiment to see how potential employers would respond to job applicants who expressed different reasons for being interested in a job.
Not only do potential employers prefer passionate applicants over applicants who wanted the job for other reasons, but employers knowingly exploited this passion: Potential employers showed greater interest in passionate applicants in part because employers believed the applicants would work hard at their jobs without expecting an increase in pay.
4. Reinforces the culture of overwork
In conversations with college students and college-educated workers, I found that a substantial number were willing to sacrifice a good salary, job stability and leisure time to work in a job they love. Nearly half – or 46% – of college-educated workers I surveyed ranked interest or passion for the work as their first priority in a future job. This compared to only 21% who prioritized salary and 15% who prioritized work-family balance. Among those I interviewed, there were those who said they would willingly “eat ramen noodles every night” and “work 90 hours a week” if it meant they could follow their passion.
Although many professionals seek work in their area of passion precisely because they want to avoid the drudgery of working long hours doing tasks they aren’t personally committed to, passion-seeking ironically perpetuates the cultural expectations of overwork. Most passion-seekers I spoke to were willing to work long hours as long as it was work about which they were passionate.
5. Dismisses labor market inequality
I find that the passion principle isn’t just a guide that its followers use to make decisions about their own lives. For many, it also serves as an explanation for workforce inequality. For example, compared to those who don’t adhere to the passion principle, proponents were more likely to say women aren’t represented well in engineering because they followed their passion elsewhere, rather than acknowledging the deep structural and cultural roots of this underrepresentation. In other words, passion principle proponents tend to explain away patterns of labor market inequality as the benign result of individual passion-seeking.
Avoiding pitfalls
To avoid these pitfalls, people may want to base their career decisions on more than whether those decisions represent their passion. What do you need from your work in addition to a paycheck? Predictable hours? Enjoyable colleagues? Benefits? A respectful boss?
For those who are already employed in jobs you are passionate about, I encourage you to diversify your portfolio of the ways in which you make meaning – to nurture hobbies, activities, community service and identities that exist wholly outside of work. How can you make time to invest in these other ways to find purpose and satisfaction?
Another factor to consider is whether you are being fairly compensated for the extra passion-fueled efforts you contribute to your job. If you work for a company, does your manager know that you spent weekends reading books on team leadership or mentoring the newest member of your team after hours? We contribute to our own exploitation if we do uncompensated work for our job out of our passion for it.
My research for “The Trouble with Passion” raises sobering questions about standard approaches to mentoring and career advising. Every year, millions of high school and college graduates gear up to enter the labor force full time, and millions more reevaluate their jobs. It is vital that the friends, parents, teachers and career coaches who counsel them begin to question if advising them to pursue their passion is something that could end up doing more harm than good.",5 drawbacks to following your passion,education
"The war in Ukraine is being described as the first social media war, even as “the TikTok war”. Memes, tweets, videos and blog posts communicate both vital information and propaganda, potentially changing the course of history. This highlights the importance of agile and critical social media use.
English in schools, in contrast, still focuses on reading books and writing exam essays. Despite mentions of media in the Australian Curriculum for English, the study of digital writing via social media is not prioritised in senior assessment or national high-stakes testing. This approach seems increasingly out of touch with modern communication.
Meme-ification is a feature of media coverage of the Ukraine war. This new word describes the explosion of ordinary people creating shareable, and potentially influential, digital content.
Anyone with a smartphone and internet access can participate in a war that is being fought both on the ground and on digital platforms. And this content frequently references other popular digital culture. For example, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is portrayed as Captain Ukraine by photoshopping his head onto Marvel’s Captain America’s body and tweeting this image.

English education for our age
This “writing” contributes to narratives and debates about heroism, military morale, fan fiction and US cultural imperialism. This kind of immediate, vibrant and global communication needs to be the basis of study in English.
The ability to critically consume and strategically create social media is vital to the health of democracies. Yet writing for social media posts and powerful platforms such as Twitter, TikTok and Facebook is not central to how we teach English.
Students need to be able to create memes, write rolling news blogs and produce digital news podcasts, all for networked audiences. They need to determine aims, invent concepts, manipulate images, combine different media, compose compelling text and respect copyright law. This is impactful and purposeful writing to achieve influence in the world.
Research initiatives such as the Digital Self Portrait project demonstrate how students can create vivid new forms of “writing” that explore tensions between their own digitally rich lives and traditional literacies.
Digital writing is often collaborative, and a recent Australian Education Research Organisation review recommends more collaborative writing in classrooms. Community organisations such as Write4Change are making this possible by connecting youth to write together using digital media via private, communal and moderated sites on mainstream platforms.

Our approach is outdated
Yet education’s high-stakes assessment regimes don’t value these forms of writing. Sadly, the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) has narrowed the kinds of writing taught in schools even further. One sample NAPLAN writing task says, basically, “Here is a picture of a box. Write a story about it.”
This approach needs to change so students are practising the forms of writing and communication that are meaningful in today’s world. This will support citizens of the future to participate fully in workplaces and, most importantly, in democracies.
The Australian government, through the Australian Research Council, has recognised this and funded a new study into the importance of contemporary writing in education. This is through a Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) titled Teaching digital writing in secondary English. This project will explore how teachers can conceptualise and enact the teaching of real-world writing.
Read more: How well does the new Australian Curriculum prepare young people for climate change?
It’s not a choice of classics or digital writing
Of course, studying the classics remains important, as does mastering basic skills. Zelenskyy himself quoted Hamlet in a recent address to the British parliament. So this is not an either/or situation, but what digital writing expert Professor Troy Hicks calls “both/and”. We can study both Hamlet as a play and how other media quote its main character in powerful ways.
Students can themselves explore making strategic literary references in their own social media posts and interventions. The study of rhetoric (argument and persuasion) and aesthetics (cultural value) needs to include diverse media for contemporary relevance.
Human conflicts, projects, imaginings and achievements are now happening in new forms. The devastating theatre of war playing out in Ukraine and online has offered “a masterclass in message”.
If a key aim of Australia’s compulsory literacy education is to “create confident communicators, imaginative thinkers and informed citizens” then students need to learn to communicate in the modes of contemporary society. They need to enjoy the engagement and learning that comes from participating in genuinely important dialogues and situations, even if just in protected classroom and school-based versions of these.
Social media use potentially both threatens and supports democracy. Yet media education remains devalued in the English curriculum and classroom, largely in favour of reproducing print literature forms and essays.
It is time for English to join the 21st century and embrace all the diverse and digital means of communication that are part of our lives today. Our freedom and futures depend on it.","Writing for our (digital) lives: war, social media and the urgent need to update how we teach English",education
"We all know that reading is good for children and for adults, and that we should all be reading more often. One of the most obvious benefits of reading is that it helps improve language skills. A major review of research on leisure reading confirmed that reading does indeed foster better verbal abilities, from preschoolers all the way to university students. But, does it matter what we read?
In four separate studies, based on data from almost 1,000 young adults, behavioural scientist Marina Rain and I examined how reading fiction and non-fiction predicts verbal abilities.
We found that reading fiction was the stronger and more consistent predictor of language skills compared to reading non-fiction. This was true whether people reported their own reading habits or if we used a more objective measure of lifetime reading (recognizing real author names from among false ones). Importantly, after accounting for fiction reading, reading non-fiction did not predict language skills much at all.
Measuring meaningful language skills
To measure verbal abilities in three of these studies, we relied on items from the verbal section of the SAT, the standardized test used by many U.S. universities when judging applicants. Thus, the measure of language skills employed in these studies is rather obviously tied to an important real-world outcome: admission to university.
Although it was somewhat surprising to discover that reading fictional stories predicts valuable language skills better than reading non-fiction, the repeated replication of this result across several studies increased our confidence in this finding.
People who reported they read for their own enjoyment were also more proficient in terms of language skills and this was partially explained by how much fiction they had read. (Seven Shooter/Unsplash)
Motivations behind leisure reading
In a follow-up study, a collaboration between my psychology lab at York University and a lab at Concordia University led by education professor Sandra Martin-Chang, we asked 200 people about their various motivations for engaging in leisure reading.
Those who reported that they read for their own enjoyment tended to have better language skills. Related to our previous finding, this association was partially explained by how much fiction they had read.
In fact, across several types of motivation, those motivations linked to reading fiction rather than non-fiction were invariably associated with better verbal abilities. On the other hand, when a motivation was more strongly associated with reading non-fiction it tended to be either unrelated to verbal abilities or associated with worse abilities.
For example, people who were motivated to read in order to grow and learn focused on reading non-fiction, so this attitude was actually associated with poorer language skills.
Reading stories
Based on these five studies, the picture is quite clear: it is reading stories, not essays, that predicts valuable language skills in young adults. But why does reading fiction have this unique advantage over non-fiction? We don’t yet exactly know, but we can rule out one obvious possibility: that fiction employs SAT words more often than non-fiction.
To investigate this possibility, we turned to several large collections of texts, containing around 680 million words in total. Words that appeared in the SAT were either less common in fiction compared to non-fiction, or the difference was so small it was negligible.
Fiction readers are therefore not doing better on SAT items simply because fiction contains more SAT words. This means that there must be something special about reading fiction that helps promote language skills. Perhaps the emotions evoked by stories help us to remember new words, or maybe our intrinsic interest in stories results in a stronger focus on the text. Future research will hopefully uncover the reasons for this fascinating difference between reading fiction and non-fiction.
Long-term benefits of reading
Leisure reading is important for developing language skills. (Allison Shelley for EDUimages), CC BY-NC
Regardless of the reasons, the fact that it is narrative fiction and not expository non-fiction that helps us develop strong language skills has important implications for education and policy.
When it comes to reading, it really is a case in which the rich get richer: A great deal of past research has established that those who read more tend to get better at reading, find it easier and more enjoyable and read more as a result. This results in a causal loop in which leisure reading reaps increasingly larger benefits for readers in terms of language skills. Remarkably, this remains true all the way from preschool to university.
These improved language skills in turn result in all kinds of important advantages, such as doing better at school, attaining a higher level of education and being more successful at work.

In fact, one study of over 11,000 people found that children who were better readers at age seven had a greater degree of socio-economic success 35 years later! This held true even after accounting for important factors like their socio-economic status at birth, intelligence and academic motivation. Leisure reading is important for developing language skills, which in turn are linked to key socio-economic outcomes.
Implications for education and policy
Work from our lab, based on young adults, is beginning to clarify the association between reading and language abilities, pointing to the importance of reading fiction and not just non-fiction.
This means that it is important to foster a love for fiction in children, to promote the healthy habit of reading stories for pleasure as early as possible.
The current trend of governments prioritizing the sciences over the humanities in education runs directly counter to the evidence available. Given the benefits that verbal abilities provide in terms of success in school and in one’s career, fostering a love for stories in children should be a high priority for governments and educators.",Reading to improve language skills?

"Threats, intimidation and misogyny have long been a reality for women in public life around the world, and the pandemic appears to have amplified this toxic reality.
Aotearoa New Zealand is led by one of the world’s best-known female prime ministers, Jacinda Ardern, and was the first country in the world to grant all women the right to vote.
Yet even here today, attempts to silence, diminish and demean the prime minister, female MPs and other prominent women have plumbed new depths, leading to calls for more robust policing of violent online and offline behaviour.
Unfortunately, the phenomenon extends well beyond elected representatives and public health professionals into most workplaces, including academia.
Women working in universities, including those in positions of academic leadership, are also routinely subjected to online vitriol intended to shut them down – and thus to prevent them exercising their academic freedom to probe, question and test orthodox ways of making sense of the world.
One of the commonest defences of abusive or threatening language (online or not) is an appeal to everyone’s right to free speech. And this has echoes within universities, too, when academic freedom becomes a testing ground of what is acceptable and what isn’t.
A duty to call it out
The international evidence indicates that almost all of this behaviour comes from men, some of them colleagues or students of the women concerned.
The abuse comes in various forms (such as trolling and rape or death threats) and takes place in a variety of settings, including conferences. It is enabled by, among other things, the hierarchical nature of universities, in which power is stratified and unequally distributed, including on the basis of gender.

We need to use our own academic freedom to assess what can happen to that of academic women when digital misogyny passes unchecked.
Whose freedom to speak?
Misogyny in university settings takes place in a particular context: universities have a statutory obligation to serve as producers and repositories of knowledge and expertise, and to act as society’s “conscience and critic”.
Academic freedom is what enables staff and students to carry out the work through which these obligations are met. This specific type of freedom is a means to various ends, including testing and contesting perceived truths, advancing the boundaries of knowledge and talking truth to power.
Read more: Academic freedom can't be separated from  responsibility
It is intended to serve the public good, and must be exercised in the context of the “highest ethical standards” and be open to public scrutiny.
A great deal has been written about threats to academic freedom: intrusive or risk averse university managers, the pressures to commercialise universities’ operations, and governments bent on surveilling and stifling internal dissent are the usual suspects.
But when women academics are subjected to online misogyny, which is a common response when they exercise academic freedom, we are talking about a different kind of threat.
Betrayal of academic freedom
The misogynists seek to silence, shut down, diminish and demean; to ridicule on the basis of gender, and to deride scholarship that doesn’t align with their own preconceptions of gender and body type.
Their behaviour is neither casual nor accidental. As journalist Michelle Duff put it, it is intended to intimidate “as part of a concentrated effort to suppress women’s participation in public and political life”.

Its aim is to achieve the obverse of the purpose of academic freedom: to maintain an unequal status quo rather than change it.
It is to the credit of women academics that the misogynists frequently fail. But sometimes the hostility does have a chilling effect. For a woman to exercise her academic freedom when she is the target of online threats to rape or kill requires considerable bravery.
Women who continue to test perceived truths, advance the boundaries of knowledge and speak truth to power under such conditions are academic exemplars. They are contributing to the public good at considerable personal cost.
‘Whaddarya?’
The online misogyny directed at women academics is taking place in a broader context in which violent language targeting individuals and minority groups is becoming increasingly graphic, normalised and visible.
We do not believe the misogynistic “righteous outrage” directed at academic women is justified under the statutory underpinnings of freedom of speech.
Freedom of speech – within or beyond a university – is not absolute, and to the extent that it is invoked to cloak violent rhetoric against women, existing constraints on that freedom (which are better thought of as protections for the targets of misogyny) need strengthening.

Men who engage in online misogyny almost always speak from an (unacknowledged) position of privilege. Moreover, by hiding their sense of entitlement behind core democratic notions, their self-indulgence does all of us a disfavour.
With academic freedom comes the moral responsibility to challenge misogyny and not stay silent. What so many women across New Zealand’s tertiary sector are subject to poses a challenge to men everywhere.
The kind of conduct our women colleagues are routinely subjected to is the sort of behaviour at the heart of Greg McGee’s seminal critique of masculinity and masculine insecurity in New Zealand, the play Foreskin’s Lament. In the final scene of the play, the main character stares out at the audience and asks: “Whaddarya, whaddarya, whaddarya?”

"COVID-induced school closures in 2020 resulted in the majority of pupils in England – at primary and secondary level – missing around 40 days of school on site. Schools around the globe were similarly affected, though to different extents.
As recent figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development show, in the first 12 months of the pandemic, 1.5 billion students in 188 countries and economies weren’t able to go to school, for varying lengths of time. Figures from the Netherlands and Ireland are similar to those in England. In Denmark, students missed closer to 20 days, whereas the numbers are much higher in Costa Rica (close to 180 days) and Colombia (around 150 days).
While most English schools during this time provided some form of remote education, these closures nonetheless resulted in learning losses. As a result, amid the UK government’s plans for post-COVID school recovery, the Department for Education has reportedly discussed extending the school day, by possibly lifting the existing cap on the number of hours state school teachers can be asked to work.

International evidence seems to suggest that, in some instances, a longer school day may be beneficial. A report by the United Nations-led Accelerated Education Working Group has proposed multiple ways to deal with pandemic-induced learning losses. These range from extending teaching time to implementing formal catch-up programmes with remedial education for struggling pupils. Extending teaching time was proposed as an appropriate strategy when pupils have missed out on up to one year of education.
Moreover, studies such as those conducted in the US and Canada and in Chile support the idea that extending instructional time could help pupils, both in the short and long term. They would benefit both academically (in terms of achieving higher test scores and higher educational attainment) and socio-economically (their future earnings would be higher).
However, a review of studies in Latin America and the Caribbean noted that, despite these benefits, there may be more cost-effective ways to attain similar results. An additional and important consideration would be the psychological cost to teachers.
Overburdened workforce
Of course, a longer school day means more teaching hours. And that raises the question of whether asking teachers to extend their working day is a reasonable request.
According to government guidelines, teachers at state schools in England can be asked to teach up to a maximum of 1,265 hours over 195 days of the year. This number does not include additional hours required for tasks, such as lesson planning, assessing, monitoring, recording, and reporting.
Data from four surveys shows that, pre-pandemic, an average full-time teacher in England worked 50 hours a week in term time and around four hours a week during the holidays. There are certainly outliers, including 10% of full-time teachers who reported working at least 30 hours per week over the summer and half-term holidays and 15 hours over the Christmas holidays. The researchers also found that the number of reported working hours had not decreased over 25 years. In fact, teachers in England have been found to work longer hours than most other countries, with lower secondary school teachers working around eight hours more per week
Our ongoing research into what being a teacher during the pandemic has been like shows teachers feel frustrated. The participants we have interviewed have relayed their distress at how the media and some sections of the public have portrayed their profession as lazy.
And the numbers bear out their frustration at that misguided impression. A survey conducted in June/July 2020 by the UK charity Education Support found that 31% of teachers and 70% of senior school leaders reported working more than 51 hours per week on average.
Since March 2020, many teachers across the globe have had to oscillate between partial school closures, partial reopenings and full reopenings. To adapt, they have had to rapidly learn new skills in order to be able to teach pupils from home.
As well as supporting their students’ learning during lockdown, teachers saw to their wellbeing and welfare. insta_photos
They have also done a lot more than just teach. They have regularly called, and in some cases visited, pupils and their families to assess and meet their academic and welfare needs. Given the ongoing uncertainty of the situation, it is not surprising that we found that our teacher participants’ mental health and wellbeing had declined over the course of the pandemic.
While there may be benefits to pupils in extending the school day, one must be wary of the costs this would incur to teachers’ mental health and wellbeing. Students would not benefit from being taught by teachers who are stressed and burned out. For any educational recovery plan to be effective, it is important to consider teachers’ needs and perspectives.",Would a longer school day help children catch up after the pandemic? Here’s what the evidence says,education
"Let’s say you’re a parent helping a Grade 1 child with their math, and they’re subtracting eight from 17, using small items — counters — like Smarties, multicoloured Rocket candies or Lego pieces.
The child counts out 17 items. Then, they count eight of those items to take away. Finally, they start counting the remaining items.
Here is where parents who haven’t revisited math instruction for decades get confused and want to show their child what they believe is a faster or better way: by picking up a pencil and paper to stack the 17 on top of the eight.
Don’t be surprised if your child brings home a few unfamiliar strategies. Many classrooms today embrace “number talks” — what math educator Sherry Parish defines as discussions about computation problems “designed to elicit specific strategies that focus on number relationships and number theory.”
Making math thinking visible
In the example above that involves subtracting eight from 17, parents may be thinking the next step in teaching a child is relaying the rule that you never take a bigger number from a smaller one.
They may want to tell the child: “You can’t take eight away from seven, so you borrow a 10 from the tens column …” That’s when the parent and child both realize they are exactly where they started, subtracting eight from 17. Yikes!
Instead of falling into the trap of showing and telling your preferred method for subtracting, mathematics educators recommend listening to learners and talking about what they already know.
What the child says and does can be a resource for understanding subtraction.
Here are ways parents or teachers could support a learner’s strategy by helping make their thinking visible.
It’s important for kids to learn to quickly see how many without counting, through quick visual recognition. (Shutterstock)
Move No. 1: Make arrangements
Talking about numbers involves understanding “how muchness” — for instance: how 17 is 20 less three, or how it’s 15 and two more. Math educators talk about the importance of learning to “subitze” — learning to quickly see how many without counting, through quick visual recognition.
Using counters helps students see quantities. This can be done by making specific arrangements with counters, like grouping counters into circles, rows or clusters of threes, fours and fives. For example, if the number 17 is arranged into subitized images of five, a child might say they see three fives and two remaining single units.
Seventeen seen as five, five, five and two. How would you subtract eight? (Marc Husband)
Prompting them to subtract eight might provoke a strategy where the child takes away five, and then another three. Depending on where the child starts taking away (from left to right versus right to left), they could be left with different subitized images: for example, two, five and two; or five and four.
Such processes of “decomposing” numbers — breaking down the eight into five, two and one — builds what’s called number sense (understanding how numbers are related).
Move No. 2: Colour code
Using different colours can help kids see numbers within numbers. (Marc Husband)
Using two different colour counters can enhance a learner’s ability to see activities that are happening in their minds.
Supposing the child says, in subtracting eight from 17, they want to subtract seven first. You can then lay out seven green counters and 10 blue ones, and then remove seven green and one blue. Coding numbers with colours helps students to see numbers within numbers (that seven and one make eight).
Move No. 3: Show the action
When learners subtract, they’re doing a mental action. Seeing this action with counters supports understanding the concept of “taking away.”
Let’s continue with our example of 17 minus eight with the 17 organized into subitized images of five and two. If the child says that they want to subtract the seven first, a parent or teacher can illustrate this by pulling (in a downwards motion) the arrangements of seven, followed by one from the remaining 10.
Moving the counters demonstrates what thinking processes are happening. (Marc Husband)
Emphasizing the mental activities by doing and recording is beneficial for all learners. It may in particular also be a way for educators to seek to engage Indigenous learners. As math researcher and educator Lisa Lunney Borden writes, in a case study of Mi'kmaw students in Atlantic Canada learning math, most Indigenous languages in Canada have verb-based origins, and language generates world views and cultural ways of knowing. From this perspective, emphasizing process and action in math may help engage Indigenous learners and affirm their identity formation whether or not they currently speak their ancestral language.
Move No. 4: Check-in repeatedly
While you’re arranging counters, colour coding and showing actions to make ideas visible, you can support a two-way conversation by checking in multiple times with kids. Consider the following questions or prompts:
“Can you say it again?”: If you’re unsure what they did, don’t be afraid to ask them to repeat it. Taking time to figure out what they did values their thinking and can be engaging for everyone, including the parent or educator.
Gesture: When you move counters to make a learner’s thinking visible, gesture by making a circle with a finger over the counters they say they’re seeing. While colour coding, you might ask: “What numbers do you see now? Show me the 10. Where’s the seven? The one?” Take turns gesturing over the counters to seek agreement on what you’re recording.
Go slowly: Students’ thinking can happen fast, so slowing down what’s happening in their head is a good thing. To support slowing down, ask questions like: “What did you do first?”
Let the learner take the lead: If the learner says their strategy is: “I subtracted seven first, then one more,” pull seven counters down and ask them which counter (from the remaining 10) should be pulled down to make the eight. The learner might choose a counter different than you. There is no correct answer here — pulling the middle counter down, for example, might make it easier for them to see the remaining nine.

"Recent heavy downpours in the Lower Volta area of Ghana led to the worst flooding in the region’s history. The flooding was caused by a spillage (a deliberate release of water) from the Akosombo Dam, the country’s biggest hydroelectric dam. Over 26,000 people were displaced. No deaths have been officially announced. The last recorded spillage was in 2010.
The Volta River Authority, the state agency that manages the Akosombo Dam, opened the flood gates to release pressure on the dam after unusually high rainfall. By September, Volta Lake, the vast, 400km-long reservoir behind Akosombo Dam, had been filled to capacity. A month after the spillage started, communities along the Volta River were severely affected by the excess water.
Local residents fled to safety, leaving behind most of their belongings. Farms were submerged and crops destroyed. The inventory of stores and businesses in low-lying areas suffered extensive damage.
The director of the disaster management organisation was quoted as saying that the floods were caused by heavy rains in the Volta catchment basin. Climate change and global warming, he explained, were responsible for all the water coming down the Volta.
Other factors are relevant too to understand this crisis. Based on my knowledge of the area as a historian who has studied the Akosombo Dam and its impact on the lives of the people in the Lower Volta, I would attribute the extent of the calamity to two additional factors.
One is the ecological and economic changes brought by the construction of the Akosombo Dam. The areas affected by the flooding have been populated by farmers who settled there after they could no longer farm and fish elsewhere in the Lower Volta once the dam was built. The second is the failings of the Volta River Authority which manages the dam.
The history
The Lower Volta lies below the country’s two large hydroelectric dams, Akosombo, completed in 1965, and Kpong, completed in 1982.
The Volta River Project was Ghana’s largest development project. It included Akosombo Dam and an aluminum smelter as the dam’s main beneficiary. Even in the 1950s the planners of the project recognised that damming the Volta would have severe economic effects on the Lower Volta. There was also recognition that the project would lead to major ecological changes.
In its 1956 report, the preparatory commission, which closely studied the Volta River Project, detailed the changes that were to come.
The first was that the construction of the dam would put an end to the ecological cycle that had nourished the Lower Volta for centuries. The area was accustomed to substantial annual floods that filled hundreds of small creeks, fertilised agricultural lands and created large fisheries. The cycle of annual floods enabled a prosperous agricultural society with farming, fishing and clam picking (which was largely done by women.)
During the dry season, men migrated upstream to fish, hunt, farm and build boats.
Once Akosombo was built, the annual floods stopped. The dam created a regulated river downstream.
The preparatory commission warned about the radical changes the dam would bring downstream. But policymakers and Ghana’s governments ignored them.
The impact on communities of the Lower Volta has been examined by researcher Dzodzi Tsikata in her study Living in the Shadow of the Large Dams. In response to the dam being built many people migrated upstream and formed the fishing communities that now populate the shores of Volta Lake. Those who stayed and continued farming had to adapt their agricultural practices by planting in low-lying areas closer to the Volta River.
Subsequently, settlements expanded into the former flood plains along the river. These areas have now been inundated by the flooding caused by the spillage at Akosombo.

Woeful response
The current flooding raises the question of who is responsible and who must compensate those who have been affected.
According to the 1961 Volta River Development Act (Act 46), the Volta River Authority has a statutory responsibility to prevent Volta Lake from rising to a height of 85.3 metres above sea level and cresting the dam.
In addition, the Volta River Authority should prevent the “flow of water past the dam” from causing “flooding downstream from dam above the levels which were normal” prior to the construction of Akosombo.
Finally, the authority has to “take reasonable measures to give warning of possible flooding from the lake or from the River Volta downstream from the dam.”
The Volta River Authority preserved the integrity of the Akosombo Dam by opening the floodgates and spilling the lake’s excess water. But it failed in its other tasks.
It did not maintain an unoccupied flood zone which could absorb the excess water.
It failed to give people a timely warning to evacuate. The managers of the dam organised a simulation exercise for surrounding communities in May 2023.
It did not help people in the flood zones to move out of danger with their belongings.
In my view, the Volta River Authority, and by extension the Ghanaian state, have a moral obligation to compensate the people affected by the spillage and the subsequent floods.
Although the authority has income through the sale of electricity, it operated at a loss in 2022, due to increased administrative expenses triggered by inflation. The Ghanaian state is also facing deficits. So there is little certainty about whether the residents of the Lower Volta will receive compensation.
One would hope that the Volta River Authority and the Ghanaian state would finally address some of the historical injustice experienced by the communities in the Lower Volta since the early 1960s.",Ghana: Akosombo Dam disaster reveals a history of negligence that continues to this day,environment + energy
"Imagine you are miles from the nearest restroom, and nature’s call is urgent – a situation that might raise a mild panic during a hike or at a music festival. Now, picture that same scenario, not as a one-off inconvenience, but as a daily reality. This is the case for about half a billion people globally.
In African countries, the issue of open defecation often goes unaddressed by society and policymakers despite its negative impact on health, economic development, dignity and the environment.
Led from Queen’s University Belfast, a team of multidisciplinary researchers aimed to evaluate how prevalent the practice is in African countries and which social factors are driving it. We also aimed to establish which communities were in most urgent need of interventions.
We used demographic and health surveys, alongside World Bank data. In a recent paper we set out our findings.
Our main ones were that in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Niger, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso and Chad, a large number of people engaged in open defecation.
We found that as few as ten countries could account for 247 million Africans defecating in the open by 2030 if critical and emergency actions are not taken.
The biggest driver is lack of access to proper sanitation facilities. The poorest individuals, particularly in rural areas, are more likely to resort to open defecation than people in urban areas. In regions with the most critical need, the poorest are 43 times more likely than the wealthy to resort to open toileting.
We recommend tackling poverty, and intervening in regions and communities that urgently need improved sanitation infrastructure and programmes. West Africa needs special attention since many of its communities are in the critical category.
A systematic approach
Sanitation has far-reaching implications for food safety. Contaminated water sources and unsanitary conditions can spread waterborne diseases, which can contaminate food and put millions at risk. Addressing open defecation is a step in ensuring the safety and hygiene of the food chain.
The link between poor sanitation and health is well documented. But our study casts this relationship in a new, alarming light: the likely role of open defecation in antimicrobial resistance.
Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, to resist the effects of medications that were once used effectively against them. It is a looming crisis, threatening to make antibiotics ineffective. Common infections could once again become deadly.
Our research suggests a probable link between open defecation and antimicrobial resistance. When people defecate outdoors, resistant bacteria from human waste can contaminate water and food. This often leads to faecal-oral diseases and urinary tract infections.
Read more: Gutter to gut: How antimicrobial-resistant microbes journey from environment to humans
However, there is a need for more research to clarify the relationship, its implications and prevention. A clear recommendation from our research is that data about antimicrobial resistance should be integrated into health surveys.
While the full breadth of the study’s findings is huge, its conclusions are clear: open defecation is a challenge in Africa that requires actions. Our research doesn’t just ring the alarm bell; it provides a blueprint for change, identifying specific regions where the practice is most prevalent and where interventions could have the greatest impact.
What needs to be done
Addressing open defecation across a continent as vast and diverse as Africa is no small feat. We made a number of recommendations in the study.
A pragmatic three-tier priority system
This will categorise regions based on the urgency of need for intervention: critical, high, and medium. Regions marked as critical are those with the highest prevalence of open defecation (more than 80% of the population) and the least access to sanitation facilities. These areas need immediate attention with the deployment of resources and sanitation infrastructure. The high priority regions have some access to sanitation. Here, the strategy is a combination of infrastructure development and community education. For medium priority areas (40%-59%), where some sanitation infrastructure may exist, the focus should be on sustainable practices, behavioural change and maintenance of existing facilities.
The system above is just to cut the high rates and inequalities among communities in a country. There is also a lot to do in communities with an open defecation rate of less than 40%. The goal is to reinforce positive behaviour and ensure facilities are maintained and improved.
Policy support, such as incentives for building private toilets or community sanitation blocks, may also help. This tiered strategy hinges on continuous assessment and reallocation of resources. Interventions should respond to the changing landscape as regions improve or decline.
Support sanitation projects and policies
Advocacy is important to increase awareness and donations to organisations that build toilets and provide sanitation programmes in affected areas.
Educate and spread awareness
Learning about the cultural and socio-economic factors that contribute to this practice must be encouraged and the knowledge shared with others. Campaigns that focus on the importance of sanitation for health and the environment are key.
Encourage sustainable sanitation practices
This includes using toilets properly, not littering, and understanding local challenges. The use of compostable toilets and other sustainable waste management practices where traditional toilets are not feasible must be encouraged.
Foster global partnerships for sanitation
Global partnerships can amplify efforts to end open defecation. Collaborations between governments, NGOs, private sector stakeholders and international organisations must be encouraged. Pooling resources and sharing knowledge can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions.",There are too few toilets in Africa and it’s a public health hazard – how to fix the problem,environment + energy
"Sub-Saharan African countries strongly rely on the agricultural and forestry sectors. Agriculture contributes up to 60% of some countries’ gross domestic product. But the sector is highly vulnerable to climate change because it relies heavily on climatic factors. This vulnerability is particularly marked in the region because of its slow rate of technological advancement.
As agricultural economists we carried out a review of the literature on the climate change challenge for agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. We explored the distribution of various climatic factors (like rainfall, temperature and extreme weather events) across the region, and their impact on agriculture. We also investigated what rural farmers were doing to respond to climate change.
We found that the implications of climate change for agricultural and economic development are diverse across the region. It is difficult to predict exactly how climate change will affect agriculture and economic development.
But is is clear that sub-Saharan African countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Botswana, and Kenya are extremely vulnerable to climate change.
Farmers are not using effective adaptation strategies. These include planting drought tolerant crop varieties, and conserving water and soil. Limited resources and infrastructure have held them back. Mitigation programmes such as carbon pricing, water management, recycling, afforestation and reforestation have had limited impact. Poor climate change awareness, unstable government policies and political instability have hindered the programmes.
The impact of climate change on vulnerable households will be extreme if adequate measures are not taken in time. Research suggests that countries such as Togo, Nigeria, Congo and Mali will record more agricultural losses without adaptation. Governments, international organisations, local communities and other stakeholders need to develop strategies to address the diverse needs of rural farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.
What our review found
The studies we reviewed indicated that patterns of rainfall, temperature and extreme weather events have changed significantly in the region. This trend is not expected to change in future decades.
Sub-Saharan Africa experiences diverse rainfall patterns. Annual rainfall can be as low as 100 millimetres in arid areas in the Sahel and parts of east Africa and over 500 millimetres in tropical areas in central and western Africa.
Temperatures can often exceed 40°C (104°F) during the hottest months. Over the last century, the mean temperature has increased by about 0.74°C.
The region experiences various extreme weather events, including droughts, floods and heatwaves. Coastal areas, especially in the eastern and southern regions, experience cyclones or tropical storms.
Many studies show that these conditions affect agricultural production and society in a number of ways:
Yield reduction: Climate change reduces crop yield. Higher temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, droughts and floods affect harvests. For instance, farmers in Nigeria have seen lower yields caused by new pests, disease outbreaks and the drying up of rivers.
Food insecurity: Poor agricultural productivity often leads to food insecurity, which affects both rural and urban populations. Lower crop yields can cause prices to rise. Reduced access to food can worsen malnutrition and hunger.
Income loss and poverty: Lower agricultural output affects the income of smallholder farmers. This can increase poverty levels and economic vulnerability. We found a decline in cereal production over the last decade in Ghana, Congo and South Africa.
Decreased livestock productivity: Higher temperatures, changes in forage availability, and water scarcity are a challenge for livestock farmers. These make livestock prone to diseases and death. Farmers incur high costs to immunise and treat animals.
Vulnerability of smallholder farmers: These farmers don’t always have the resources and capacity to adapt to the impact of climate change.
Recommendation and policy implications
The review of studies showed that sub-Saharan Africa could develop economically if rural farmers took more effective measures against climate change.
We made the following recommendations to protect farmers from the impact of climate change:
Strengthen institutions for policy development and implementation. Coordinating climate change adaptation efforts and sustainable agricultural practices improves farm productivity.
Improve rural infrastructure. This would promote economic growth, reduce poverty and make rural communities more resilient.
Initiate public welfare programmes. Improved access to finance, markets, education and climate information would enhance social protection.
Establish more forest plantations and maintain existing ones. They would help absorb the impact of climate change on agriculture and promote economic development.
Afforestation and reforestation can also help absorb carbon and conserve biodiversity.",Climate change and farming: economists warn more needs to be done to adapt in sub-Saharan Africa,environment + energy
"Plastic pollution is an urgent environmental issue, globally. Every year, about eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans.
Most of the 17 west African countries have a problem managing plastic waste. Eight of them are among the top 20 with the least effective plastic waste management practices – up from five in 2015. This has worsened marine pollution and adversely affected activities in the region.
Coastal provinces account for about 56% of west Africa’s GDP and one-third of the population lives there.
In 2018, west African nations launched the West Africa Coastal Area Management Programme to protect and restore the ecological, social and economic assets of coastal areas. It’s supposed to do this by addressing coastal erosion, flooding and pollution. Last year it received an additional US$246 million in funding from the World Bank. This has brought the World Bank’s total financing of the project to US$492 million.
For many years, we have researched development economics, particularly the interface between the use of natural resources and the development of countries. We’ve also been involved in research on plastic pollution through the interdisciplinary “Revolution Plastics” initiative of the University of Portsmouth’s Centre for Blue Governance.
Our findings on plastic pollution could help west African countries to spend World Bank funds effectively.
We recommend that nations first quantify the volume, type and origin of plastics discarded in coastal zones. Then they must focus on reducing plastics from source, as well as promoting reuse and recycling. They can draw on successful case studies globally, which can be adapted to local contexts.

Healthy oceans and a circular economy
The West Africa Coastal Area Management Programme has initiated studies to assess the environmental and economic impact of plastic pollution in the region. These studies also aim to explore the benefits of moving to a circular economy: an economic system that reuses or regenerates materials or products in a sustainable way.
The programme expects that a circular economy will create new economic opportunities through markets for reusing products and materials. Rather than discarding products, they can be put back into the economy. This can create demand for services and technologies related to collecting and processing them.
The programme can benefit from research on sustainable plastic management from other regions to achieve its objectives.
Research partnership
The Centre for Blue Governance has expertise in blue economy, marine ecosystem management, climate change and circular economy. It has extensively researched plastic pollution in Portsmouth, a port city in the United Kingdom, and beyond. We have found that sustainable plastic management can be achieved in various ways. These strategies could be relevant for initiatives in west Africa. They include:
Inclusive partnerships: Collaborating with businesses, campaigners and citizens on the Revolution Plastics initiative, we apply research to develop eco-friendly fabrics and combat microplastic pollution.
Awareness campaigns through art: Community awareness of the harmful effects of plastic pollution is necessary. Through the Masibambisane project in South Africa, we explored street art, theatre and song to create awareness about plastic pollution.
The project achieved significant results in KwaMhlanga, in South Africa’s Mpumalanga province. It demonstrated that raising awareness through art could inspire people to change their behaviour. These communities now have a deeper understanding of the urgent need to act against plastic pollution.
In addition, the introduction of sorting facilities close to homes increased recycling rates and encouraged sustainable habits. The west African programme can incorporate these lessons into the e-book it is planning. This is a way to share information about best practices and encourage action in communities.
Reuse and recycling projects: Through our inDIGO-EU and Microseap projects we reduced plastic waste by promoting recycling and reuse. For example, the INdIGO project has developed biodegradable fishing gear that reduces the environmental impact of ocean fishing in the UK and France. Based on this project, the West Africa Coastal Area Management Programme can develop a sustainable alternative to the gear used for small-scale fishing in the region.
From diagnosis to action
Our research findings suggest that for optimal use of the World Bank fund, the West Africa Coastal Area Management Programme could consider the following action plans:
Collect data on plastic pollution: Start with a regional study to quantify the volume, typology and origin of plastics discarded in coastal zones. This could involve the use of technologies such as drones, sensors and remote sensing to map pollution hotpots. Perception surveys could also help to understand behaviours and attitudes related to plastic pollution. The aim is to establish precise indicators and predictive models that can measure how well future interventions work.
Plan for a switch to a circular economy: The plan should focus on source reduction, reuse, recycling and material recovery. A committee made up of government actors, private enterprises and local communities could oversee implementation.
Design community awareness and education programmes: These campaigns should instil a sense of environmental responsibility and give people tools to actively participate in reducing plastic pollution. Involving opinion leaders could increase their impact.
Develop ways to use plastic waste: Value chains for sorting, recycling and valorising require infrastructure, like modern sorting centres. Advanced recycling technologies and market mechanisms for recycled materials are also necessary. Partnerships could be established with local businesses to create products from recycled plastics, such as construction materials or textiles.
By investing in these targeted areas, it is possible to create a sustainable system that offers economic and social opportunities to local communities.",West Africa’s plastic waste could be fuelling the economy instead of polluting the ocean: experts,environment + energy
"For the past 16 years South Africans have dreaded rolling power cuts euphemistically dubbed “loadshedding”. These are caused by the ailing state power entity Eskom’s crumbling infrastructure and its over-reliance on ageing and poorly maintained coal-fired power stations. Loadshedding has worsened in 2023, with some areas experiencing power cuts for up to 10 hours a day.
This crisis affects every aspect of the country’s economy, including its vibrant tourism sector. Tourism is a vital contributor to the South African economy. In 2019 the country welcomed over 10 million foreign visitors. The sector contributed up to 6.4% of the gross domestic product along with 1.5 million jobs (9.3% of total jobs).
These figures have contracted significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visitors are returning. But the financial recovery and viability of the sector, which is composed mainly of small businesses, continues to be hampered by the electricity crisis.
If tourism businesses are to literally and figuratively keep the lights on they must transition towards renewable electricity generation. There are three reasons for this. First, providing consistent electricity to their guests is essential for any tourism business. Second, renewable energy is less damaging to the environment than coal-based generation and its greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, customers are increasingly aware of environmental concerns. Many demand more sustainable tourism products and adjust their travel choices accordingly.
We are a team of interdisciplinary researchers with interests in tourism, sustainability and the environment who recently collaborated on a research paper that studied South Africa’s potential to break away from old forms of energy generation towards low carbon electricity generation. There are already some positive moves in this direction. But much more remains to be done. This will require the tourism industry and other economic sectors to step up.
What’s already being done
Some work is already being done to enhance the tourism sector’s environmental sustainability. The government’s Tourism Environmental Implementation Plan, published in 2021, facilitates greater participation by tourism establishments in renewable electricity generation and saving.
Read more: South Africa's power crisis will continue until 2025 - and blackouts will take 5 years to phase out
One initiative included in the plan is the tourism department’s Green Tourism Incentive Programme. It supports small tourism businesses by providing free energy and water audits. These can lead to improved efficiencies and the introduction of subsidised renewable energy systems. So far, 111 renewable energy projects have been funded. The Green Tourism Incentive Programme pays approximately two-thirds of investments. Individual businesses finance the remaining third.
In the private sector, the City Lodge hotel group shows what can be achieved by installing renewable energy systems. In 2020, solar panels generated just over 10% of the electricity requirements of the group’s 59 hotels.
Nature-based tourism is one of the mainstays of South African tourism products. South African National Parks, the body that manages national parks, has installed solar PV panels at 19 of its 21 parks. It is also putting in place other low-carbon strategies as well as climate adaptation plans.

Getting it done
While these examples are encouraging, they remain limited in size and scope. Most innovation in South Africa towards sustainable energy generation has been self-funded as a business survival strategy to deal with the consequences of power cuts. The shift to renewable electricity, along with its greenhouse gas and air pollution benefits, is a happy coincidence.
A broader transition, helped by access to finance on terms that can smooth its way, is necessary to bring about a system change for tourism. This can place the sector on a path that decouples it from coal-based electricity. It will also ensure that small businesses can adopt renewable electricity.
The green energy shift in tourism is already taking place in developed economies in Europe. Turkey is another encouraging example. It has introduced a sustainable tourism programme; solar PV panels are used widely by businesses and households alike.
Through shifting the tourism sector to renewable energy, tourism in South Africa can be part of the just transition too. This transition must include small and community-based tourism players. And, while tourism must play its part, other economic sectors should also step up.
Supportive South African policies are indispensable in developing an enabling environment for sustainability transitions. The state and its institutions must take greater responsibility and accountability to advance the social sustainability of energy policies. One way this could happen is by making the Green Tourism Incentive Programme more accessible to tourism enterprises across the country.

"101 Curious Tales of East African Birds is a new book that uses academic research to tell fascinating stories about the tropical birds of east Africa, from well-known species to rare ones. It also explores changing bird behaviour in the region. Its author, Colin Beale, studies shifts in the distribution of birds and other animals. We asked him four questions.
Why is it important to study birds and their environment?
Like millions of people around the world, I love watching birds. They’re so accessible, and their busy lives brighten up pretty much anywhere from a city centre to remote wilderness landscapes. And the more I watch them, the more curious I get about their lives and the adaptations that help them survive.
It is easy to see this as pure indulgence, the study of ornithology as a pastime of the rich in a time when most of the world still struggles with basic needs. But I see birds and birdwatching as a gateway drug to ecology, and ecology is the science that can help us tackle the biodiversity crisis that threatens life on Earth today.
Read more: Why a proper record of birds in Africa is so important -- for Europe
Hearing that the rufous-tailed weaver had expanded its distribution from Tanzania into Kenya set me on a path that led first to identify much wider distribution changes in east African birds, then to link this to changing rainfall patterns.
Next, I took a leap into research projects seeking to understand how fire affects bird diversity and may help mitigate changes in grassland quality. Ultimately I was working with pastoralist communities of northern Tanzania to restore rangelands degraded by climate change and inappropriate grazing regimes.
Studying birds is not only good for your own mental and physical health, but can lead to valuable action on environmental challenges.
What sets east Africa’s birds apart?
The combination of extraordinary diversity, stunning colours and relatively high visibility makes the birds of east Africa a particular delight. With about 1,500 species in the region (more than 1,000 in Tanzania alone) the diversity is nearly overwhelming. Sit and watch a single bunch of flowering bushes and you could easily see five or six exquisitely plumaged sunbird species come and feed on them.
While several South American regions have slightly higher diversity than east Africa, the visibility in East African savannahs makes birding so rewarding. The birds also have an incredible variety of lifestyles, with certain behaviours such as social breeding much more common in drier tropical areas than elsewhere. I’m always finding new ways for birds to make a living.
An additional part of my fascination is the relative lack of research on east African birds. While a few species have been very well studied, there are still many species for which we don’t know the answers to basic questions, such as where and when they nest.
What are the most intriguing bird stories you have recorded?
The stories I enjoy sharing the most are the ones that either illustrate a piece of ecology that surprises, or describe an extreme evolutionary oddity.
For example, I love sharing how Temminck’s coursers, a beautiful cream and apricot ground bird with smart black and white highlights, are adapted to burnt landscapes. So many people consider wildfires destructive and bad. For many visitors to east Africa’s protected areas, discovering that rangers deliberately set fires is shocking. But these are ecosystems that have co-evolved with hominids, and our ancestors have been setting fires in savannahs for longer than almost all the species have existed.
Fire-dependent species like Temminck’s courser arrive while fires are still burning, set up territories and nest on bare, burnt earth. Their eggs and chicks are blackish to maximise camouflage, fully reliant on this human-derived landscape. This is testament to our ongoing role in maintaining savannahs.

Consider too the evolutionary processes that led to ostrich males fighting over and stealing each other’s chicks. This apparently strange behaviour makes perfect sense when you realise that feeding more chicks costs ostriches nothing as they feed themselves, but surrounding your own brood with a larger flock of tasty chicks means that hungry predators are less likely to eat your offspring. The more we know about birds, the more questions we uncover.
Why do your findings matter, and for whom?
My original aim in collating these stories was to share some of the fascination and joy that I take from learning about east African birds and to bring them in an accessible way to a wider audience. I originally started researching these stories to provide safari guides with more information to share with their clients when they’re bored with yet another sleeping lion, but it soon became clear the audience was wider.
I passionately believe that the more someone knows about birds the more they enjoy them and, hopefully, the more likely they are to take actions that protect them and the environments they depend upon.

I don’t think the science I describe is always of particular importance, but hopefully the curious tales that are collected inspire more people to take notice of the birds around them. There is no doubt in my mind that we need more people who care, or the biodiversity crisis that the world is facing will continue unabated. If you like wildlife, if you like birds or even if you just want to spend some time thinking about something other than the news, I hope you might enjoy this collection of scientific tales and perhaps be galvanised to take some action to protect the natural world we all depend upon.

"As cities grow, more people need food. However, space for farming is limited in cities. Building facades can offer a solution for growing food. We asked landscape architect Karen Botes to tell us about her research – cultivating traditional African vegetables on walls.
What are ‘living wall systems’ and why did you study them?
Living wall systems are vertical growing platforms which usually form part of a building façade. Some are continuous, others modular.
Continuous systems are lightweight screens with pockets that can contain wet felted substrate layers, or rock wool, for the plants to grow in, or the plants’ exposed roots are kept wet with nutrient-rich fluids. An example of a continuous system is hydroponics.
Modular living wall systems are irrigated plant trays or pots containing soil and fixed onto a supporting structure on the building’s vertical surface. Modular systems are widely used because they make an immediate aesthetic impact. The plants are pre-grown offsite and individual plants are easily replaced.
To learn more about which modular living wall systems work best, I compared two during the 2021/2022 growing season in Pretoria, South Africa. My six-month study also compared traditional African vegetable crops with a mainstream crop.
What are the benefits of living walls?
Benefits of living walls include food production, biodiversity, cooling, air purification and noise reduction. They also have aesthetic value and are known to reduce stress and improve productivity and wellbeing.
When households grow edible crops in living walls, it reduces the environmental impact of food because it doesn’t have to come from far away. And it reduces waste. Growing vegetables has also been found to encourage urban gardeners to eat a more balanced diet in Honduras, Japan, Australia and elsewhere.
I’m interested in whether living walls with traditional African vegetables could improve local household food production and contribute to dealing with climate change, urban heat islands and urban microclimates.
What did you discover in your study in Pretoria?
The study compared the performance of traditional African vegetable crops in two types of living wall system, the Vicinity wall and the Eco Green Wall, in terms of crop yields and health.
The Vicinity wall is an all-in-one system, with water tanks at the bottom, a pump and a filter. The top row of pots is drip irrigated and the water gravitates into each row, before circulating back to the top row. The Vicinity pots are clipped onto an aluminium rail fixed to the building.
The Eco Green Wall comprises interlocking, lightweight blocks made out of recycled polystyrene aggregate-and-cement mixture, and plant pots with a soil volume of roughly 1.5 litres. It is designed with economic feasibility and sustainability in mind.
I compared the living wall systems’ performance to traditional soil-based agriculture. Variables included minimum and maximum daily temperatures, relative humidity, precipitation, soil temperature, water content and electrical conductivity, leaf biomass yield and plant stress.
The study found that local production of the living wall components reduced their cost and carbon footprint.
Low technology that requires basic assembly, and a basic irrigation system to limit dependency on electricity and water, can enhance performance.
The Vicinity living wall system. Karen Botes
An appropriate plant selection can further improve the living wall’s resilience, feasibility and sustainability. The study identified seven traditional African vegetable species suitable for household food production in living wall systems: creeping foxglove, Indian borage, jute plant, pink ribbons, water mint, dwarf elephant’s food and black-eyed pea.
How feasible is it? What are the biggest barriers?
Building facades make up roughly double the area of building footprints in urban areas. This means that walls have more potential for local food production than traditional soil-based urban agriculture. They also have environmental benefits.
But the efficiency, resilience and sustainability of current living wall systems have been questioned globally and need improvement.
They are costly to install and maintain.
They seldom provide optimal conditions for plants to flourish.
They rely on electricity and water.
Some systems require specialised skills and technology.
What could make it work for cities on the continent?
Sun exposure of plant pots should be limited so that the soil doesn’t get too hot. The Eco Green Wall system is an example where sun exposure is limited and the structure protects the crops.
Pots need to have at least three litres of soil with a depth of 200mm. This increases yield and reduces plant stress. The soil must be lightweight and meet the plant’s requirements. Aeration, texture and drainage must be right. The pots’ drainage holes must limit blockages.
A drip or wick irrigation system for each plant level reduces maintenance and increases resilience.
Selecting traditional African vegetables increases the feasibility and resilience of crop performance. These crops can tolerate sub-Saharan Africa’s harsh climate conditions.
Traditional African vegetables also have a high nutritional value, don’t need much irrigation or chemicals, and are resistant to disease.
These vegetables prefer full sun and no frost. Well-drained, aerated potting soil that allows for movement of air, water and nutrients works well for them. They require moderate irrigation.
The system should be positioned to avoid possible contamination of crops by polluted environments. It must be orientated to provide efficient sun exposure for the selected plants.
So, are living wall systems worth considering to grow vegetables?
I concluded from my research that growing traditional African vegetables in modular living walls saves space compared to standard soil-based food production on a household scale. Considering the horizontal footprint area occupied in terms of yield per square metre, living wall systems with larger pot volumes produced over four times the yield of conventional soil-based agriculture. And they use space that would otherwise not have been used productively.
I also concluded that outdoor modular living wall systems with selected traditional African vegetable crops might be one way of improving food security and urban environments in sub-Saharan Africa.",Growing African vegetables on buildings can save space and feed cities – new study,environment + energy
"Giraffes are the world’s tallest mammals and an African icon, but they are also vulnerable to extinction.
Giraffe populations have declined by 40% in the last 30 years, and there are now fewer than 70,000 mature individuals left in the wild. What are the causes of this alarming decline, and what can be done to protect these gentle giants?
The five biggest threats to giraffes are habitat loss, insufficient law enforcement, ecological changes, climate change, and lack of awareness. Below, I will tell you about these threats and what is being done to save them.
I will also explain a study I was a part of that ranked these threats in terms of each one’s danger of causing giraffe extinction, and whether human actions can alleviate that danger. The study used data from more than 3,100 giraffes identified over eight years in an unfenced 4,500km² area of the Tarangire ecosystem in Tanzania. We used the data to simulate how environmental and land use changes could affect the giraffe population over 50 years.
The findings can guide conservation actions.
Habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss
Giraffes need large areas of savanna with abundant native bushes and trees to feed on. The biggest threat to giraffes is the degradation, fragmentation and loss of their habitats through human activities such as farming and human settlement expansion.
Habitat loss outside protected areas is the main reason for the recent decline in giraffe numbers. National parks provide most of the remaining habitat. Some good habitat remains unprotected but is cared for by pastoralists.
Traditional pastoralists like the Maasai in northern Tanzania maintain large spaces of natural savanna where wildlife and people thrive together.
However, most people now living in areas that were giraffe habitat are sedentary. As populations of farmers and townspeople expand, giraffes are forced into smaller and more isolated patches of land. This reduces their access to food and water, and increases their vulnerability.
Conservationists are working to safeguard existing unprotected giraffe habitat and maintain or restore the connections among protected areas. Community-based natural resource management is central to this activity. It gives local communities the legal power to protect their land and resources.
Insufficient law enforcement
Another major threat to giraffes is illegal hunting (poaching) for bushmeat markets. This is usually controlled by international criminal syndicates.
Strong wildlife law enforcement is the best tool to combat this threat. Conservationists are working to strengthen local and international law enforcement around wildlife crimes, and to reduce the demand for giraffe products. At the grassroots level, this requires supporting anti-poaching patrols by rangers and village game scouts. It’s also essential that communities should have legal alternative ways to make a living.
Ecological changes
A third major threat to giraffes is human-caused ecological change that affects their food availability and mobility. These changes include deforestation of savannas for fuelwood and charcoal production, mining activity, and road and pipeline building. Water diversion and groundwater pumping also affect their habitat and access to water.
Mining, roads and pipelines can disrupt the natural movement patterns of wildlife, leading to smaller, more isolated populations that are more susceptible to local extinction.
Conservationists are promoting sustainable forestry, new cooking techniques such as gas stoves, water conservation and planning for groundwater resources, and building wildlife crossings into roads and pipelines.
Climate change
Climate change from human-caused carbon dioxide pollution is forecast to increase temperatures and rainfall in many African savanna areas. Giraffes are unaffected by the higher temperatures observed so far, but increased seasonal rainfall is associated with lower giraffe survival due to disease and lower food quality.
Over the longer term, more rainfall will create conditions favourable to increased woody plant cover in savannas. This could help giraffes by increasing their food supply, but only if enough natural savanna is preserved from human exploitation.
Lack of knowledge and awareness
The fifth major threat to giraffes is the lack of knowledge and awareness about their conservation needs. Giraffes are often overlooked and underrepresented in wildlife research, funding and policy. Many people are unaware that giraffes are endangered and face multiple threats across Africa.
Conservationists are working to increase knowledge and awareness about giraffes locally and worldwide. Scientists are studying giraffe demography, diet, behaviour and genetics, and there is a large environmental education programme in Tanzania, the US and Europe.
Creating a safe future for giraffes
Giraffes are facing a silent extinction crisis in Africa. But there is still hope that they can be saved if people understand and address the threats.
The new study I coauthored ranked threats and looked at potentially mitigating actions. Our simulation showed that the greatest risk factor for local giraffe extinction was a reduction in wildlife law enforcement leading to more poaching. In the model, an increase in law enforcement would mitigate the negative effects of climate change and the expansion of towns along the edges of protected areas. The study highlights the great utility of law enforcement as a nature conservation tool.
Abundance after 50 years measures relative extinction risk of a simulated giraffe metapopulation. The greatest risk of population declines and extinction for giraffes is caused by a reduction in wildlife law enforcement.
Given their vast historical Africa-wide range and individual home ranges of thousands of hectares, giraffes will not likely survive only within the boundaries of small, fragmented protected areas. I propose as part of our evidence-based recommendations that rangelands used by wildlife and pastoralists as movement pathways be permanently protected from farming, mining and infrastructure. This will give people as well as wide-ranging animals like giraffes freedom to roam.
It will also require the expansion of wildlife law enforcement in village lands outside formal protected areas.
These measures would help make it possible for people and giraffes to thrive together.",Giraffes could go extinct – the 5 biggest threats they face,environment + energy
"Nigeria’s Niger Delta region is rich in natural resources. Its vast oil and gas deposits are the mainstay of the country’s economy.
The region, in the southernmost part of the country, features coastal barrier islands, mangroves, freshwater swamp forests and lowland rain forests. The coast offers various ways of making a living, like fishing, tourism, producing salt, and farming coconut and bananas.
Yet it is estimated that over 47% of the population in the region lives below the poverty line.
We study the economic aspects of environmental issues, and in a recent paper set out to understand the relationship between the destruction of coastal ecosystems in this region and the economic hardship the people faced.
We found that marine ecosystems had been badly affected by a number of factors, including an increasing population, pollution, over-fishing, damaging fishing techniques and global warming.
The degradation of the environment affects the poor the most as they depend on natural resources like seafood and wood for survival and energy. And they do not earn enough to relocate from polluted areas.
The destruction of an ecosystem
We identified a few areas where the Niger Delta ecosystem had been badly affected. The environmental problems in communities like Bille, Andoni, Okirika, Emohua and Ibaa in Rivers State are caused by oil spills, gas flaring, human activities and water pollution, among others.
Between 1976 and 2006, there were at least 7,000 oil spills in the region, affecting an area of more than 2,500 square kilometres. These oil spills have polluted the soil, water and air, and they have had a devastating impact on the people who live in the region. The destruction of the ecosystem has led to environmental problems like flooding and soil erosion, which destroys homes and crops, leading to further poverty. The lack of a healthy ecosystem has led to health problems for the people living in the region.
Gas flaring is the process of burning off excess natural gas that is produced during oil drilling. More than 2.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas are flared every day in the Niger Delta. This process emits greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere, and it also wastes a valuable resource that could be used to generate electricity or heat homes.
Mangroves are being lost because of water pollution. Mangrove forests are an important source of food and income for local communities, and their loss has led to a decline in fish stocks and other marine resources. This has damaged the livelihoods of fishers and increased the price of fish in local markets.
The environmental consequences of the destruction of mangroves include erosion and increased vulnerability to storms and flooding.
Natural resources such as nutrient-rich soil, water, trees and fossil fuels abound in marine ecosystems. Excessive exploitation of these resources through mining, logging and oil drilling has had a negative impact.
Animals in an ecosystem keep the food chain in balance. Due to overfishing and hunting, many animals are disappearing from the Niger Delta. Manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, monkeys, antelope and others are under threat.
The destruction of the ecosystem in the Niger Delta has led to a cycle of poverty:
depletion of resources means people can’t make a living
environmental problems like flooding and soil erosion destroy homes and crops
human health depends on a healthy ecosystem.
There is evidence that destruction of the ecosystem has led to poverty in the Niger Delta region. Increasing soil sterility and diminishing agricultural output have forced farmers to move or seek illicit sources of living. The degradation of traditional fishing grounds has worsened hunger and poverty in fishing communities.
Protecting and restoring ecosystems
The impact of environmental degradation will only worsen if nothing is done to protect and restore degraded ecosystems.
In our paper we made the following suggestions.
Regulate human activities: Fishing and hunting in the region should be controlled to prevent the depletion of fish and wildlife. Industrial activities, such as oil drilling and shipping, should also be regulated to prevent further pollution of the air, water and soil.
Restore degraded ecosystems: Mangrove forests can be replanted in areas where they have been destroyed. Another example is restoring wildlife populations through captive breeding programmes and releasing animals back into their natural habitats.
Build the capacity of local communities to manage their natural resources: This is essential for the long-term protection of the region. One example is providing training to community members on sustainable fishing and hunting practices. Another example is giving local communities a say in how their natural resources are managed.
Establish marine protected areas: This would help to conserve marine life and ensure that coastal communities can continue to benefit from the resources they depend on. One example is the Calabar-Oron Marine Protected Area in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states. It is home to a variety of marine life, including dolphins, turtles and whales. The area is used for sustainable fishing, ecotourism and research.
We also recommend steps to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.
Provide access to quality education and healthcare: Education can help to create greater awareness about environmental issues, and lead to economic opportunities. Availability of these social services could reduce the appeal of rebel groups that promise economic and social benefits.
Address marginalisation: Groups like women and ethnic minorities can be given equal access to resources and opportunities through inclusive decision-making at the local, state and national levels. Development programmes should target their specific needs.
Finally, renewed efforts should be made to address conflict and insecurity in the Niger Delta by strengthening governance and the rule of law. Improved governance can lead to stronger enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, which can protect ecosystems from further degradation. In addition, it can protect land rights and create a more stable environment that offers economic opportunities.","Niger delta is rich in resources, but environmental destruction is pushing people into poverty",environment + energy
"Seahorses are considered fabled creatures by many; something that only exists in old mythical tales of the ocean. But these curious animals really exist – and they’re not the only members of the Syngnathidae family of fishes. Other syngnathids are pipefish, pygmy pipehorses and seadragons, and all are enchanting.
Sadly, syngnathids all over the world are at risk. They face major threats, ranging from both intentional and unintentional harvesting to habitat loss and alterations. Syngnathids are commonly found in shallow, coastal environments, which magnifies the impacts of these threats.
Syngnathids, and specifically seahorses, are the subject of various global and regional research initiatives. They are relatively well studied in many parts of the world. This is, however, not true for sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the published research from the region has focused on the endangered Knysna seahorse (Hippocampus capensis) and the critically endangered estuarine pipefish (Syngnathus watermeyeri), both found in South Africa. Recently, a pygmy seahorse (Hippocampus nalu) was also discovered in Sodwana Bay, South Africa – the first ever recorded from Africa.
But South Africa is just one country on a vast continent. This prompted us to conduct a comprehensive review of the diversity, distribution, ecology and conservation status of the family Syngnathidae in sub-Saharan Africa and adjacent islands. We attempted to collate all existing information, data and observations of syngnathids in the region.
Our findings unveiled a total of 63 syngnathid species across 26 genera in the study area. Mozambique exhibited the highest species diversity, followed by Madagascar and South Africa. There were many interesting, exciting data points, but it also became evident that regionally much needs to be done in terms of research and conservation action on the ground (or rather, in the water!).
How we did it
It’s no easy task to gather information for this kind of review, especially because there isn’t a lot of published information available. As a first step, we did a deep dive to collate all peer reviewed published articles, as well as information produced outside traditional publishing and distribution channels, such as management plans and government documents.
Doryrhamphus Louw Claassens, Author provided (no reuse)
We then turned to the African marine community, reaching out to our network of keen divers and researchers within the region. We also used various citizen science platforms such as iSeahorse and even created an iNaturalist project for all syngnathid observations in sub-Saharan Africa. On iNaturalist, people could log their observations with the location, drawing on the wider community for help with identification where needed.
Read more: How an underwater photo led to the discovery of a tiny new seahorse species
The response from the marine community and observations logged on iNaturalist yielded some wonderful results. For instance, the discovery of a new species of pipehorse, currently under peer review.
What we found
Once all the data was collected and collated, some key findings emerged.
There is limited information on the biology of sub-Saharan syngnathids, making it tough to understand the population dynamics, habitat use and association, and life history of species. This highlights the need for further species-specific research.

Most assessments that included information on syngnathid populations came from general fish surveys. It is very tough to find syngnathids and they tend to be sparsely distributed, so targeted survey approaches are needed to detect them.
Twenty percent of syngnathid species found in the region are listed as data deficient on the IUCN Red List. One example is Bulbonaricus brucei, which is only known from its type specimen (the first specimen collected and used to describe the new species). There have been no published observations of this species after its initial description in 1971. This highlights the need for locally significant and current data.
Read more: DNA in the water shows South African scientists where to find a rare pipefish
Sub-Saharan syngnathids are susceptible to the same threats as species elsewhere in the world, like harvesting, poaching, impacts from by-catch and habitat loss and alteration. We concluded that different species face different types of threats based on where they are found along the seascape. Similarly, what would work in terms of conservation actions depends on the species and where it is found.
To illustrate this, we created a schematic summarising the main threats and the most suitable conservation actions across the seascape for all syngnathids found in sub-Saharan Africa.
More to learn
It’s clear from this review that sub-Saharan Africa is home to many weird and wonderful syngnathids. We believe that many remain to be discovered. However, it is also apparent that research and conservation actions must be scaled up. Scientists need to conduct more species-specific assessments to develop locally significant management and conservation actions. It’s also crucial to untangle syngnathid diversity and taxonomy in the region for deeper understanding, combined with the development and support of local expertise.","Tiny and mysterious: research sheds light on sub-Saharan Africa’s seahorses, pipefish and pipehorses",environment + energy
"The Kaokoveld region, covering north-western Namibia and south-western Angola, is one of the remotest areas in southern Africa. Although it’s extremely dry, it is a centre of species endemism: many species occur only there and nowhere else on earth.
New species continue to be found, especially in the Ovahimba mountain range, which runs parallel to the cold Atlantic ocean and is separated from it by the gravel plains and dunes of the northern Namib Desert.
The highest mountain peaks of this range are so inhospitable and difficult to access, because of the lack of roads and water, that few have ever scaled them. The exceptions are local herders of the semi-nomadic Himba, who drive their cattle and goats to richer pastures in the mountains during dry periods.
In 2021, I was part of a team of researchers from Namibia and Angola who aimed to investigate the biodiversity and endemism on some of the most remote peaks. We hypothesised that the mountain peaks harboured a large number of species, especially plants, insects and reptiles. That’s because there’s a rapid change in climate and topography (land features) from the hyper-arid, cool desert near the coast and the arid and seasonally warmer plains further inland to the cooler mountainous escarpment.

Through an EU-funded transfrontier conservation project, SCIONA, we had the opportunity to use the only safe option to get to the Ovahimba mountain peaks: a helicopter.
It is incredibly exciting to plan a trip to such a remote and beautiful wilderness area where few people have intervened in the ecosystem.
Because of the high cost and complicated logistics, we had to limit the visit to a few days on each of three mountain tops. Two were in Angola – Serra Cafema and Serra Tchamalindi in Iona National Park – and one was in the Otjihipa range of Namibia. The mountain tops were selected based on their altitude and remoteness. They also have many ecological niches based on exposure to wind and sun.
At each campsite, we left excitedly in different directions, to return and exchange findings and stories after sunset.

Even in this short visit, we found plenty of interest and some surprises. Of the 285 plant species we encountered, 34 species are endemic to the Kaokoveld. One is new to science and at least six endemics fall in the endangered IUCN red list category. Sixteen plant species that were previously known only from Namibia were found in Angola. We also recorded two bird species, the Cape Eagle Owl and Layard’s Warbler, in Angola for the first time.
These mountain flora deserve priority conservation efforts to protect endemic and other plants that have survived in these refuge sites, providing a habitat for some unique fauna.
Helicopter adventure
Our helicopter hops between the mountains gave us unforgettable, magnificent views of the mountains, through which the glittering Kunene River meanders. The first campsite was in the Otjihipa range, at a mountain that we named Middelberg (1,941 metres above sea level).
The ridge boasts a diverse shrub and woodland vegetation, unlike the barren plains surrounding it, because of the cooler temperatures, the water bearing capacities of rocks, less grazing and browsing, and what we assume is higher rainfall (there are no records). It was adorned by beautiful Kaoko tree-euphorbias (Euphorbia eduardoi).

We also found a large underground cave with intact stalactite and stalagmite formations. This is unusual in the area and may indicate that there was much more water there in the past.
The second campsite was near a mountain top in the eastern part of the large Tchamalinde range, at an elevation of 1,420 metres above sea level. The helicopter could not land higher up the mountain where it was covered with a continuous tree layer. The Kaokoveld endemic flower Turnera oculata var. paucipilosa thrives in this area, as well as the resurrection bush (Myrothamnus flabellifolius) and the black stick lily (Xerophyta retinervis).

Our last campsite was 100 metres from the top of the highest mountain of Iona National Park, Serra Cafema (2,050 metres above sea level). Of the three mountain tops we visited, it was the closest to the coast (85km) and therefore also the coldest and windiest.
Despite the harsh climate, there was a surprising amount of vegetation, mainly a mosaic of hardy Cape fynbos-like shrubs and dry savanna vegetation with large-stemmed Namib resin trees (Ozoroa crassinervia). It was a surprise to find the tall Euphorbia monteiroi subsp. brandbergensis as it was previously only known further south in Namibia. Another beautiful Turnera flower (Turnera oculata var. oculata) was common at Serra Cafema, as well as large specimens of mother-in-law’s-tongue (Sansevieria pearsonii).
Even on the mountain top of Serra Cafema, the highest and remotest of all, there were signs of human impact via grazing.

The findings show the highest plant biodiversity on Serra Cafema, with 56 species per 1,000m² compared to 47 species per 1,000m² for the other mountains. Of the three mountains, Serra Cafema is the most influenced by fog caused by the cold Benguela current. Species composition is very different from the surrounding lowlands.

Protecting biodiversity
We unlocked only a fraction of the mystery held by these biodiversity hotspots. There is no doubt that yet more unusual and interesting plants and animals are waiting to be discovered on these inaccessible peaks, especially because our visit took place after 10 years of drought. Huge swarms of locusts were in the barren plains at that time.
However, our reconnaissance survey did show that the plants here need protection. They are threatened by climate change and overgrazing by livestock. Management of the Ovahimba highlands is in the hands of Namibian communal conservancies, the NGO African Parks and the Namibian and Angolan governments. African Parks recently took over management of Iona National Park, which may offer opportunities to protect the mountain habitats.",Namibia and Angola’s remote Ovahimba mountains reveal a haven for unique plants – new survey,environment + energy
"Indigenous knowledge and traditional practices have played a critical role in development all over the world. For centuries, various disciplines ranging from medicine to biodiversity conservation have drawn on these resources.
On the African continent, societies have been guided by a wide range of beliefs, norms, customs and procedures in managing their ecological and social systems.
For example, cultural values and social practices have helped communities achieve sustainable agriculture. These include traditional practices in food preservation, weather monitoring and forecasting and crop production.
Unfortunately, indigenous knowledge of agricultural practices is rapidly disappearing, because it is not being preserved. One possible solution is digitalisation. This involves using modern information and communication technologies to capture, store and share farmers’ traditional wisdom and practices.
I conducted a literature review to explore the benefits and challenges of preserving indigenous agricultural knowledge in a digital form in Africa.
I found that mobile phones, computers, cameras, scanners and voice recorders were useful tools for this purpose. But the process must involve the local communities that use these practices. They are the creators, guardians and sharers of indigenous knowledge through their lived experiences and practices.
Their participation is critical for a number of reasons. One is that they would improve the quality and accuracy of knowledge stored in digital form. Another is that they would avoid errors or misunderstandings that might arise from language or cultural barriers.

Digital technologies can enable wider use of indigenous knowledge. They can promote better management of agricultural resources and preserve traditional practices.
I also identified several challenges that hinder the process. Policy gaps, network connectivity issues and the high cost of digital tools were among them.
The findings of this study could inform policies and interventions to record and share indigenous knowledge in Africa.
Digitalisation: what’s missing?
Digital technologies are already widely used in Africa, particularly among smallholder farmers. They are used in irrigation farming, precision farming, drought predictions, micro-climate monitoring, and crop disease risk assessments. Efficiency, productivity and functionality are among the claimed benefits.
But my study found little evidence of indigenous agricultural knowledge being preserved. Some countries are making progress, however. South Africa has developed a system to document indigenous knowledge. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are also developing and using knowledge management initiatives. In Ghana, people are recording traditional knowledge of forest food and medicine.
More needs to be done.
How it could be done
Indigenous agricultural knowledge can be collected, processed, stored and shared in various formats. Technologies such as smartphones, voice recorders and video cameras can capture texts, videos, images and voice narrations about indigenous plants and traditional agricultural practices.
These could cover information on crop production systems, food preservation and livestock management. Weather and seasonal forecasting would be another area to cover. Management of resources like soil and water would also be useful to record.
The study found that databases of these practices and information could be a great resource for farmers. They could share their experiences of applying indigenous practices on various digital platforms. Other users could provide feedback.
My research also showed that the internet would be a valuable tool. Information could be shared on platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and TikTok.
Hurdles to overcome
The study identified several challenges facing the digitalisation of indigenous agricultural knowledge. Affordability of smartphones is sometimes an issue for smallholder farmers. And connectivity is sometimes poor in rural or semi-urban areas.
Governments could make strategic investments to overcome these challenges.
I argue in my paper that the application of indigenous agricultural knowledge practices could help address declining agricultural productivity on the continent.
In addition, I argue in favour of promoting indigenous knowledge of agricultural practices to address social challenges. Indigenous knowledge has a contribution to make to sustainable agricultural productivity and food systems. It also offers insights that may be useful for conserving natural resources such as water, forests and land.",Traditional farming knowledge should be stored for future use: the technology to do this is available,environment + energy
"Following two decades of fierce negotiations, over 60 countries recently signed a UN Ocean Treaty to conserve biodiversity on the high seas.
The “high seas” are all ocean areas which aren’t under a specific country’s direct ownership or regulation. They make up two-thirds of Earth’s oceans, providing 90% of the habitat available for life.
The treaty has been celebrated as historic. It’s the first time that action will be taken against unregulated use of resources in this ungoverned space.
It’s estimated that 90% of the world’s marine fish stocks are now fully exploited, overexploited or depleted. Although less than 10% of the total global fish catch is from the high seas, the unregulated nature of fishing there has a harmful impact on marine life.
The treaty consists of 76 articles. Their goals include the protection and sustainable management of the marine environment, preserving the integrity of ocean ecosystems – such as coral reefs – and conserving biological diversity. Once ratified, the treaty will allow the establishment of marine protected areas in the high seas.
Though it doesn’t explicitly prohibit commercial fishing in the high seas, it includes language that may allow for their “sustainable use”. So, the establishment of a protected area in the high seas is expected to address unsustainable fishing activities in the space, but only if fully implemented.
Read more: African marine rules favour big industry, leaving small-scale fishers in the lurch
Part of my expertise lies in maritime and natural resource governance in Africa, so I’ve been following this development. There are reasons to celebrate the Oceans Treaty for what it represents – an extra mechanism to protect our oceans and their resources. But my main concern – which has also been flagged by others – is that the treaty could drive distant water fleets (fishing outside their own territory) to fishing grounds closer to land. And many of the most lucrative grounds belong to African countries.
The treaty has been described as “extremely broad” and lacking specifics. Clear regulations must be put in place by the treaty’s implementing agency. It’s not yet clear who that will be. The treaty calls for state parties to allow for the establishment of various committees and working groups, together with a Conference of the Parties to guide implementation.
I argue that clear regulations must ensure that fisheries subsidies to vessels that once relied on the high seas must be cut. Subsidies given to distant water vessels can encourage the overexploitation of vulnerable species.
Attractive fishing grounds
Having lost access to fish on the high seas, fleets will need new fishing grounds. African waters are an attractive target for various reasons.
Firstly, they’re rich in diverse species.
Secondly, these waters are not properly monitored, which means countries can take advantage of them. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing already costs Africa over US$2.3 billion annually.
Thirdly, coastal African states appear willing to enter into new agreements with nations that fish outside their own borders.
This is worrying because it’s going to put Africa’s vulnerable fish stocks at risk. Distant-water vessels are already known to be exploitative.
Who are these vessels?
About 97% of high-seas fishing is done by vessels flagged to high-income countries – the vast majority (86%) are from China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Spain.
Vessels from some of these countries, such as China, South Korea and Spain, already have fisheries arrangements with countries in Africa. And they’re known to contribute to the overexploitation of fish on the continent through legal and illegal fishing.
Harmful subsidies
These high-sea fishing vessels come from the top 10 countries providing fisheries subsidies.
Fisheries subsidies are financial support given by governments to help the private sector, including distant-water vessels, to catch more fish. Some of these subsidies have been shown to be harmful, particularly to vulnerable species.
Harmful subsidies encourage overfishing, as the money is spent on capacity-expanding activities such as artificially lowering fuel and vessel construction costs. This allows large vessels to catch more fish than is sustainable by fishing farther out to sea and for longer periods. Many industrial fleets wouldn’t be profitable without these subsidies.
The treaty doesn’t clearly address subsidies, but they are the subject of the World Trade Organization’s 2022 Fisheries Subsidies Agreement. This, however, has not come into force as two thirds of the signatories have not yet accepted the deal. Under the proposed agreement, signatory countries must commit to stop providing harmful subsidies.
If harmful subsidies aren’t effectively addressed, a ban on fishing on the high seas could end up contributing to increased fishing activities within the jurisdictions of coastal countries.
What must happen
Aside from the treaty being effectively implemented, several measures and strategies can be deployed to ensure African countries are protected.
There must be more support from the international community for regional fisheries bodies – such as the Fisheries Committee for the West Central Gulf of Guinea and Regional Fisheries Commission for the Gulf of Guinea – for countries in west Africa. The regional bodies must be in a better position to guide member states on sustainable fisheries practices, enforce regulations where they exist or update regulations as needed.
Read more: Fisheries subsidies fuel ocean depletion and hurt coastal communities
There must be increased support in monitoring fishing. Partners and non-governmental organisations share data from satellite technology and vessel tracking systems that helps coastal states monitor what goes on in their waters. The international community must provide further support so that coastal states can enforce existing regulations by sharing capacity, technological know-how and assets.
By combining these strategies and fostering international cooperation, it is possible to strike a balance between implementing the treaty and fishing sustainably in Africa’s oceans.",New treaty to protect the world’s oceans may hurt vulnerable African fisheries,environment + energy
"Around the world, natural history museums hold a treasure trove of knowledge about Earth’s animals. But much of the precious information is sealed off to genetic scientists because formalin, the chemical often used to preserve specimens, damages DNA and makes sequences hard to recover.
However, recent advances in DNA extraction techniques mean that biologists can study the genetic code of old museum specimens, which include extremely rare or even recently extinct species. We harnessed this new technology  to study a snake from the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe that was run over in 1982, and discovered it was a new species. Our research was recently published in PLOS One.
The Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe, a mountain chain on the border with Mozambique, create a haven of cool and wet habitats surrounded by savannas and dry forest. They are home to many species that are found nowhere else.
Here, a mysterious population of snakes first drew the attention of scientists around 1920. An unusual snake displaying a cobra-like defensive hooding posture was spotted in the grounds of Cecil Rhodes’ (prime minister of the Cape Colony in the late 19th century) Inyanga Estate in Nyanga.
This snake had unusual markings with red skin between its scales, creating the effect of black dots on a red background when its hood is extended. None of the other cobras found in the area match this description.
More snakes like this were reported in the 1950s, but no specimens were collected.
A rare find
The mystery surrounding these sightings piqued the interest of the late Donald G. Broadley, now considered to be the most eminent herpetologist (reptile and amphibian expert) of southern Africa. In 1961, Broadley was given some severed snake heads and identified the mystery snake as a rinkhals (Hemachatus haemachatus), a species otherwise only found in South Africa, Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) and Lesotho.
A handful of specimens were observed and measured in later years, but the landscape has been drastically altered by forestry. The rinkhals from Zimbabwe has not been seen in the wild since 1988 and is feared to be extinct.
This population lives 700km away from other, more southerly populations, which made us suspect it may be a separate species. But the genetic material contained within the specimen from Zimbabwe was degraded, meaning we couldn’t do the DNA studies needed to confirm whether it is a different species from other rinkhals.
New technology
However, the latest DNA extraction and sequencing methods have been developed over the last ten years to help biologists study the remains of ancient animals. We used the new techniques to examine the Zimbabwe rinkhals specimen. Our study showed they represent a long-isolated population, highly distinct from the southern rinkhals populations.
Based on their genetic divergence from the other rinkhals, we estimate that the snakes in Zimbabwe diverged from their southern relatives 7-14 million years ago. Counting a snake’s scales can help identify what species it is. Subtle differences in scale counts, revealed by our analysis of other specimens, provided enough evidence to classify the Zimbabwe rinkhals as a new species, Hemachatus nyangensis, the Nyanga rinkhals.
The scientific name nyangensis means “from Nyanga” in Latin.
Hemachatus nyangensis has fangs modified to spit venom, although the behaviour was not reported from the few recorded interactions with humans. The closely related true cobras (genus Naja), some of which are known to spit venom, do so with the same specialised fangs that allow venom to be forced forwards through narrow slits, spraying it toward animals that are threatening them.
Venom in the eyes causes severe pain, may damage the eye, and can cause blindness if left untreated. Venom spitting appears to have evolved three times within the broader group of cobra-like snakes, once in the rinkhals, and twice in the true cobras in south-east Asia and in Africa.
A connection between human and snake evolution
Scientists think this defence mechanism may have evolved in response to the first hominins (our ancestors). Tool-using apes who walked upright would have posed a serious threat to the snakes, and the evolution of spitting in African cobras roughly coincides with when hominins split from chimpanzees and bonobos 7 million years ago.
Similarly, the venom spitting in Asian cobras is thought to have emerged around 2.5 million years ago, which is around the time the extinct human species Homo erectus would have become a threat to those species. Our study of Nyanga rinkhals suggests that the third time venom spitting evolved independently in snakes may also have coincided with the origin of upright-walking hominins.
If a living population of Nyanga rinkhals was found, fresh DNA samples would help us to more accurately determine the timing of the split between the two species of rinkhals and how this compares to hominin evolution. Technological advances may be giving us incredible insights into ancient animal lineages but they can’t make up for an extinction. We still hope a living population of Nyanga rinkhals will be found.
The possible relationship between venom spitting and our early ancestors is a reminder that we are part of the Earth’s ecosystem. Our own evolution is intertwined with that of other animals. When animals become extinct, we don’t just lose a species - they take part of our history with them.",New species of cobra-like snake discovered – but it may already be extinct,environment + energy
"Climate risks can be complex to deal with because they don’t respect country borders. Hazards in one region can have negative repercussions in another. These are known as transboundary climate risks, and they’re a growing concern. They require coordinated, multinational responses, which can be a challenge given the different priorities and capabilities of each country.
A transboundary climate risk could be due to a shared ecosystem, such as a river basin. For instance the Nile river, which flows through 11 countries, can experience variations in water availability due to changes in the weather. This will affect the millions who depend on it.
Transboundary climate risks can also cross continents and oceans and spawn crises on the other side of the world. These could range from food and water shortages to threats to trade and energy, widening inequalities, forced migrations and even geopolitical conflicts.
For instance a drought in East Africa could affect tea production in Kenya. This would lead to an increase in prices for tea drinkers in importing countries, like the UK. Likewise, a typhoon could affect manufacturers in south-east Asia. This could disrupt the supply of electronics to African markets and lead to price hikes or shortages.
Africa is particularly vulnerable. Trade routes, supply chains and shared ecosystems span across the continent. A climate-induced disruption in one country can easily ripple into cascading effects in its neighbours. The coordinated management of transboundary climate risks is both a challenge and a necessity.
At the recent Africa climate summit in Kenya, the African Union and other African stakeholders presented the Roadmap for African Resilience to address this.
The roadmap contains a series of actions meant to enhance coordination between the regional economic communities and member states in addressing and managing transboundary and cascading climate risks. This is an objective of the African Union’s Climate Change and Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan 2022–2032.
Historically, adaptation efforts have largely addressed localised impacts, such as rising sea levels and coastal communities or frequent droughts and their impact on agricultural yields.
As an expert on adaptation to climate change, I believe that the significance of this roadmap lies in its comprehensive, continent-wide approach. It recognises that shared challenges require shared solutions. And it underscores Africa’s commitment to taking charge of its climate destiny. This makes the roadmap valuable in the evolving discourse on global climate resilience.
Unified front
The Roadmap for African Resilience outlines 25 crucial actions to fortify Africa’s resilience against transboundary climate risks. It has a focus on the risks posed to global supply chains, energy and food markets.
The roadmap’s actions can be grouped into four general plans:
Recognise the risks: this includes a pan-African transboundary climate risk assessment and the development of risk indicators.
Govern together: identify the transboundary risks that each country considers most important. These will be included in different areas of policy.
Implement Africa-wide adaptation: create a plan to find the best ways to strengthen communities against transboundary climate risks. Just resilience principles are embedded into this, such as prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable people and upholding human rights and cultural values. The roadmap also kickstarts a programme to put these ideas into action.
Mobilise resources for resilience: getting more money from multiple countries to support climate action, making sure private investments match public goals by emphasising systemic resilience, and building capacity to invest together.
The Roadmap for African Resilience thus offers a holistic, pan-African vision. It not only identifies transboundary climate risks but also proposes a structured approach for collective action.
Implementing the roadmap requires the active involvement of a range of African organisations. These include the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union Commission, the African Union Development Agency – New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the African Group of Negotiators Expert Support and the Regional Economic Communities in Africa. In addition, national governments, the private sector, civil society and academia play crucial roles.
The challenge will lie in ensuring cohesive action among these entities. Especially when adaptation to climate risks is a relatively new endeavour for some of the above organisations.
Significant step
The inaugural Africa Climate Summit marked a significant step for Africa’s collective commitment to resilience. The roadmap acknowledges the reality of Africa’s intertwined destinies and the need for collaborative solutions to cross-border climate risks.
Given the borderless nature of climate risks, global cooperation must be at the heart of adaptation initiatives.

"Whether the water at your local beach is being roiled by nasty weather or is a perfectly calm expanse of blue, there’s always a great deal going on under the surface. The ocean is composed of various currents and water masses; those currents flow around the world through what is called thermohaline circulation.
This circulation drives the distribution of heat, salinity and nutrients throughout the world’s oceans, ensuring that our whole planet is habitable for life.
The Atlantic leg of this circulation is called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The Atlantic Ocean is situated between the Americas, western Europe and the western margin of Africa. The AMOC distributes heat away from the tropics northward, ensuring that tropical regions are not overheated, which would cause an imbalance in climate. It, like other oceanographic systems, varies annually, over decades and centennially. Scientists study these oceanographic systems over a longer time period to understand how they work and to make predictions on how they will function in future and what their impact may be.
In July 2023 two Danish academics – physicist Peter Ditlevsen and his sister, the statistician Susanne Ditlevsen – published a paper in which they stated that the AMOC was in decline and would likely shut down mid-century. That would bring dramatic consequences: rising sea levels, global heating, shifts in marine ecosystems, and seriously compromised food security. It could also seriously affect the upwelling marine ecosystem along the western margin of South Africa and Namibia, which is the most productive upwelling system in the Atlantic.
In the Ditlevsens’ scenario, Europe could see massive cooling of around 5°C to 10°C and the tropics could become overheated. Certain areas around the world would experience severe droughts and flooding. And the oceans would become more acidic.
The paper has generated controversy in the scientific community. As a geologist whose research interests include oceanographic change, I don’t find the article surprising. Research has shown that the AMOC has not been a stable feature of the ocean over millions of years and is sensitive to climate change. However, I agree with the general scientific consensus: the shutdown of the AMOC will not be as abrupt as the paper claims; it will instead be more gradual over the coming centuries.
Constant shifts
The Atlantic Ocean is not the only part of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation that is experiencing shifts. In the South Indian Ocean, the Agulhas Current is also weakening due to changing distribution in heat and freshwater from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean.
And in the Pacific Ocean, west of the Americas, El Niño events – the warming of that specific ocean – are intensifying.
The Ditlevsens based their findings largely on sea surface temperatures. The paper does not consider other factors such as which carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels in the atmosphere (and take-up by the oceans), coupled with temperature changes, would be the tipping point for the AMOC to shut down, or the state of deep water generation – water of specific density, salinity and temperature – at the source regions in the North Atlantic for the functioning of the AMOC.
The broad consensus among scientists is that, while the AMOC is weakening, the probability of it completely shutting down in this century is low.
Read more: Atlantic collapse: Q&A with scientists behind controversial study predicting a colder Europe
It’s also important to point out that ocean currents and circulation change over time. The AMOC has strengthened and waned pre-human history over geological time, particularly in response to colder or warmer periods. For example, studies along the western margin of South Africa have found that the AMOC in the South Atlantic is sensitive to changes in the global climate cycle.
The Atlantic Ocean is stratified with different water masses crucial to the functioning of the AMOC.
Previous research has also indicated that the AMOC weakened or shut down before, thousands of years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum. That happened under different conditions than what we are experiencing today. During that time the climate was much colder and the ice sheets were at a maximum position, although a warming phase led to the retreat of ice sheets afterwards.
Perspective
This large body of evidence suggests that the AMOC will continue to weaken as currents fluctuate over time, driven by different environmental factors. But scientists have not yet accepted that a total shutdown of the system will occur over the next few years or couple of decades.
However, the paper that’s caused so much controversy shouldn’t be dismissed entirely. For one thing, it’s a good conversation starter on this very important topic. It also provides a timeline for when the AMOC could shut down – anywhere between 2025 and 2095. While the consensus is that this isn’t accurate, it’s a useful starting point from which other scientists could generate scenarios and models for further study.
In doing so, our collective understanding of the AMOC system will deepen, which should influence policy decision-making.",The Atlantic Ocean’s major current system is slowing down – but a 21st century collapse is unlikely,environment + energy
"Trophy hunting is contentious. It typically involves paying for and pursuing a specific wild animal, often a large or iconic species, with the goal of killing it to obtain a trophy, such as the animal’s head, horns, or hide.
Popular public opinion is largely in favour of ending the killing of wild animals for sport. However, the topic is hotly debated by policymakers and academics because of the potential financial incentives it can provide to local communities and landowners to support conservation efforts.
Against this backdrop, we set out to test whether visitors to South Africa would be willing to pay a “lion protection fee” at border entry points. Our idea was that this could compensate for any lost revenue from trophy hunting were it to be banned.
We chose lions because they have wide appeal and are one of the most readily recognised trophy hunted animals.
We spoke to 907 people who were visiting, or planned to visit, the country. We found that a high percentage – over 80% – were in favour of the idea of a lion protection fee. And we calculated, on the basis of two scenarios, that the amount they were willing to pay could generate enough funds to equal, if not exceed, those currently generated by trophy hunting in South Africa.
Our findings come at an important time. South Africa is opening a public policy consultation on how the country can adopt a more sustainable and ethically driven approach to wildlife conservation.
A complex debate
The competitive nature of trophy hunting, in particular, has raised serious animal welfare concerns. Animals may experience huge stress as they’re pursued for days and separated from their family groups. Some hunting outfits use methods which may inflict prolonged and undue animal suffering.
From a conservation perspective, some advocate for trophy hunting because, for example, income generated may help mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, support anti-poaching efforts, and prevent land containing wildlife from being converted to other uses. They believe that banning it could negatively affect conservation and community livelihoods.
Others, however, argue that trophy hunting could negatively affect conservation. For instance the specific targeting of certain animals – like males – could have a harmful effect on species population dynamics and social structures. Questions have also been raised as to whether funds from trophy hunting always reach local communities or those on the frontlines of conservation.
Ultimately, these discussions come down to a single issue: popular public opinion is against trophy hunting, but how could the financial revenue that it generates be replaced?
Lion protection fee
We surveyed people who had previously visited South Africa, or who would consider visiting in the future. We drew respondents from overseas countries and from the African continent.
Respondents were shown a statement saying that a total ban on trophy hunting in South Africa would help protect lions by preventing them from being hunted and killed as trophies. And that such a ban could be funded by introducing a “lion protection fee”, added to the visas of incoming tourists.
They were then asked questions to gauge what daily fee would be acceptable and how likely they would be to visit South Africa under different daily fee scenarios.
Of 907 respondents, 84.2% stated that being charged a “lion protection fee” was a “great” or a “good” idea. A minority (7.5%) had a negative view. Only two respondents (0.2%) indicated a pro-trophy hunting attitude.
We used this survey to create initial estimates of the maximum price ranges tourists would be willing to pay.
There were two main fee scenarios.
In the first scenario, overseas visitors would pay between US$6 and US$7 for every day they’re in the country for a maximum of six days. Southern African tourists would pay between US$3 and US$4. We worked on tourist numbers which we sourced from Statistics South Africa. Our calculations were based on around 2.6 million overseas visitors and 12.3 million southern African tourists.
In the second scenario, fees would be collected as a one-off departure tax of US$6 for all foreign visitors leaving by land or sea, and US$33 for air passengers. Once again, we used tourist numbers from the Statistics South Africa. Our calculations were based on around 10.5 million foreign visitors leaving by land, 70,000 leaving by sea, and 3.4 million flying out.
Our calculations show that in both scenarios enough funds could be generated to at least equal, but potentially exceed, the US$176.1 million currently generated by trophy hunting of all the iconic species in South Africa a year. These calculations are based on numbers of visitors from different traveller categories multiplied by the median number of days those traveller-types stay.
Based on the number of respondents who said they would rather not visit because of the fees, we calculated that there would be a 15% decrease in the number of tourists willing to visit South Africa. But we argue that these decreases could be partially compensated for by increased visits from travellers previously deterred by trophy hunting – 13% of those who did not wish to travel to South Africa cited trophy hunting as a reason.
A 2021 survey of European Union citizens backs up our findings. It showed that 84% of 10,687 respondents were either somewhat or strongly opposed to “the trophy hunting of wild animals found in Africa”.
Replacing trophy hunting revenue
Our findings could pave the way for a responsible transition away from trophy hunting without unintended repercussions for wildlife and the communities that rely on them.
The practical implementation would need diligent deliberation. For example, administrative logistics and sensitivity to fluctuations in visitor numbers must be taken into account.
In addition, while the idea of channelling these funds towards landowners and communities for wildlife conservation holds promise, there are concerns about public trust in institutions. Such funds must be carefully managed.
The types of tourism taxes we propose are not new. Twenty-two countries around the world currently charge a tax on tourists to preserve their natural and cultural heritage.
This is a pivotal moment for the future of South Africa’s biodiversity and ethical wildlife tourism. The question now is whether the country seizes this opportunity to redefine its approach to conservation and chart a new course towards a more sustainable and compassionate future.

"Building collapses have become a major menace in Lagos, Nigeria. Lagos is the business hub of the country and has its largest seaport and airport. With an estimated population of 15.4 million, it is the largest city in sub-Saharan Africa and the second largest in Africa after Cairo.
The city has two distinct geographical areas: Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland, connected by three bridges. Lagos Island is the historical nucleus of the city. This area is renowned for its eclectic mix of architectural styles, a blend of modern skyscrapers, remnants of colonial-era structures and bustling traditional markets. It serves as the centre of the city’s financial, entertainment and corporate activities. Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki are popularly regarded as an extension of Lagos Island.
Lagos Mainland has residential areas, markets and industrial zones.
There have been numerous building collapses in both areas.
Using machine learning techniques, we built a model that ranked the factors affecting building construction collapses in order of relevance. We also modelled the number of casualties by location.
Read more: Knowing what leads to building collapses can help make African cities safer
The study classified causes of building collapses into human factors, natural disasters and unspecified causes. Human factors included sub-standard material, structural defects, onsite changes of plan, bad supervision, demolition processes, non-adherence to building standards and regulations, lack of geotechnical information, poor maintenance, construction defects and overload.
Based on our results we made two findings.
First, location was the most relevant factor contributing to building collapses in Lagos. We found that more buildings collapsed on the island than on the mainland.
Second, building collapses on the mainland had a higher number of casualties than those on the island.
Based on our findings, we recommended proper onsite geotechnical inspection before the start of construction in both locations.
Building the model
Our study showcased the applicability of supervised machine learning models for a range of purposes. Supervised machine learning models are algorithms that learn from labelled data, where the input (features) and corresponding desired output (labels or targets) are provided. These models are trained to recognise patterns and relationships in the data, allowing them to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.
Our study provided a comprehensive analysis of building collapse statistics in Lagos from 2000 to 2021. The buildings ranged from bungalows to multi-storey buildings and skyscrapers.
On average, four buildings collapse each year, resulting in approximately 31 casualties annually.
The highest number of collapses occurred in 2011, with 10 buildings involved, followed by 2000 and 2006, with nine each. The peak casualty count, 140, occurred in 2014. It was concentrated in the Ikotun-Egbe area of the Lagos mainland.
The differences
Our model suggested that the higher number of collapses on the island was due to the soil there. The island soil’s geotechnical properties give it poorer capacity to bear building loads.
We identified three factors for the higher number of deaths from building collapses on the mainland:
Many landowners in the mainland area ignored soil tests because they assumed it was safe to build there, given the area’s reputation of having soil that could bear heavier building loads.
The height of the building.
The quality of materials used.
To prevent future collapses and casualties
Our study emphasised the importance of understanding the causes of building collapses in Lagos, and the potential of machine learning algorithms for prediction.

We made a number of recommendations.
First, that it is important to carry out basic soil investigation using the right professionals and building engineers to ascertain the geological properties or bearing capacity of the soil.
This information would clearly identify the type of building that the soil can support.
Second, assigning the right job to the right professional is paramount. For instance, the job of a civil engineer should not be assigned to an architect.
Third, eradication of substandard materials is key to a durable structure.
Fourth, many property owners add extra floors and extensions to maximise profit. Yet the higher the building, the deeper the foundation. Geotechnical properties of the soil will determine the choice and quality of the foundation. In addition, location should determine the choice of a building foundation.
Last, there should be policies in place to enhance proper onsite geotechnical inspection.

"Johannesburg and its surrounds, at the centre of the industrial heartland of South Africa, have been hit by severe water cuts. Water interruptions have been happening for years, but they have been scaled up dramatically in recent weeks. The deteriorating situation recently forced the Minister of Water and Sanitation, Senzo Mchunu, to intervene. On 27 September he announced a new initiative – “water-shifting”. The proposal has echoes of “load-shedding”, the term used for the planned power outages which have become a common feature of life for all South Africans. Anja du Plessis, a water management expert, explains the new water initiative.
When did water outages start, and what are the latest developments?
Freshwater challenges are a frequent occurrence in South Africa. These include increased pressure on the amount of freshwater available for use, unequal distribution and lack of access to clean water and sanitation services.
Gauteng province, the country’s economic hub, has not been spared. The water crisis has been driven by a number of factors:
the overall decay in the quality and state of water infrastructure – it is at risk of total collapse in some areas
droughts
alleged corruption, which has affected the functioning of municipalities and municipal treatment plants.

Neither the national nor regional water authorities have managed to find solutions to the water crisis. Rather, the situation has deteriorated. In the last few months some consumers, such as those living in the suburb of Brixton, west of central Johannesburg, have had dry taps for more than three weeks.
Water tankers have been brought in to provide supplies. But residents complain that these are unreliable and they don’t trust the quality of water. Some people use it only to bath and flush toilets, and buy bottled water for drinking and cooking.
Three weeks ago the national and regional water authorities announced a plan that would spread the impact of water cuts between communities. The term the politicians coined for the new measures is “water-shifting”.
What is ‘water-shifting’ and how will it work?
The plan is to begin “sharing” water to take the pressure off the worst affected areas. By and large, high-lying areas of the city have been the hardest hit.
The reason for this is that the distribution of water requires pressure, which comes from a water source – a reservoir or water tower. When pressure is lost within the system, high-lying areas are usually affected first as there is not enough pressure in the system to get the water to them.
Pressure is lost when reservoirs reach critically low levels. This can happen as a result of leakages, burst pipes, above-average water consumption or power outages which affect pump stations.
Any of these can lead to pressure decreasing at a rapid rate.
Read more: Power cuts in South Africa are playing havoc with the country's water system
Johannesburg’s water utility, Rand Water, plans to shift water from a reticulation system with sufficient pressure to a struggling system. The idea is to provide an equitable supply of water to municipal customers.
Rand Water will implement water-shifting as an interim measure to assist in the recovery of struggling reticulation systems. An implementation date has not been given.
But Johannesburg Water, which is responsible for supplying water to the city’s residents, needs to develop and present a water management plan to address the crisis.
Could this crisis have been avoided?
In short, yes. The Gauteng province metropolitan councils are perfect examples of the effects of poor water governance and management as well as lack of political will over the past two decades. This has led to a lack of investment and underfunding of bulk water and sanitation infrastructure.
The result is that the water infrastructure, from water supply to treatment, storage, water resources and management, has fallen into disrepair. Also at play is a lack of planning and management of growing water demands due to increased population, migration and expansion of settlements. The poor management and overall lack of water and sanitation delivery and services is another factor.
There have been frequent water cuts in the province over the past five years. An estimated 30% of the province’s residents reported frequent water interruptions in 2017/18, increasing to 33% in 2020/2021.
Johannesburg isn’t alone. The poor state of water infrastructure across the country has been an issue for many years.
A detailed account was set out by the South African Institution of Civil Engineering in 2022. It showed that the country’s water infrastructure had deteriorated to the point that it was at risk of failing. The report called for prompt action to avoid severe water supply shortages.
Unfortunately, this wasn’t heeded.
Other factors have contributed to the water crisis too.
Firstly, there’s been continuous high consumption by consumers, partly due to increased temperatures. The province’s residents consume an estimated 300 litres (which includes water losses) each a day, compared to the global average of 173 litres.
Another factor has been the amount of water being lost. In Johannesburg, for example, a minimum of 41% of treated potable water supplied by Rand Water to Johannesburg Water is lost before it even reaches the consumer. This is referred to as non-revenue water by the municipality. Water is primarily lost through leakages and bursting pipes, attributed to poor operation and maintenance.
Is ‘water-shifting’ a solution?
The Minister of Water and Sanitation has made it clear that this is an interim measure.
But even as an interim measure it will require a high level of political will as well as technical expertise to work.
“Water-shifting” should not be a permanent measure or become the norm as it does not address the cause of the current crisis. Potable water will still be lost through leaking and burst pipes.
Relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Water and Sanitation, Rand Water and municipalities such as the City of Johannesburg need to stop the blame game and work together to address the primary causes of the water challenges, instead of the symptoms. The dilapidated state of water infrastructure needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to avoid water rationing.",Johannesburg has been hit by severe water shortages: new plan to manage the crisis isn’t the answer,politics
"Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu announced a new ministerial portfolio in August: Marine and Blue Economy. This was welcome news as it renewed hope for economic development outside the oil sector. We asked marine sustainability and blue economy expert Isa Olalekan Elegbede to explain how the ministry could benefit Nigeria.
Why has Nigeria established a new ministry for the blue economy?
The blue economy is the sustainable use of ocean and coastal resources for economic growth. It integrates environmental, social, economic and institutional objectives into the use of marine resources. It includes a wide range of sectors and resources related to oceans, seas, coasts and waterways.
The ocean economy supports 90% of global trade and provides millions of jobs. It includes shipping, tourism and offshore energy valued at US$24 trillion.
Marine fisheries and reefs, sea grass and mangroves are worth US$6.9 trillion; trade and transport US$5.2 trillion; and coastline productivity and carbon absorption US$12.1 trillion.
Nigeria’s establishment of a Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy is a strategic move. I believe the ministry will tap the country’s rich marine resources as an element of the national economic framework.
Nigeria’s coastline stretches for 420 nautical miles and covers an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles. Its maritime interests span the Gulf of Guinea, covering roughly 574,800 square nautical miles with a 2,874 nautical mile coastline.
Marine resources can be exploited to create jobs and transform Nigeria into a leader in sustainable marine activities. It will help diversify the country’s oil-based economy as well. Norway is an example of how this has been done successfully.
What four areas should the ministry focus on?
Nigeria hopes to generate over US$1.5 trillion annually from exploiting its marine resources. To achieve this, the ministry should do the following:
Create an inclusive committee for effective collaboration among stakeholders and partners. The committee should include scientists, NGOs, youth and traditional communities. Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, and the relevant federal government agencies should not be left out. The committee should advance beyond the scope of the Expanded Committee on Sustainable Blue Economy in Nigeria inaugurated by the former president Muhammadu Buhari.
Integrate sustainability into policies and strategies. Policies should prioritise sustainable marine resource use. Strategies should focus on sustainable and ethical harvesting, trading, extraction and tourism. Blue economy personnel, unemployed youths and women should be trained. Improved programmes would foster sustainable practices and raise the sector’s contribution to the country’s gross domestic product.
Sustain investment in ports, transport systems and storage facilities. The same should apply to research and technology. Aquaculture, offshore energy and marine biotechnology should be advanced to increase efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, remote coastal communities should have access to resilient and blue renewable energy sources and systems to enhance protection of coastal and ocean resources.
Check mismanagement. To ensure a sustainable future for all, the government should protect coastal and marine ecosystems. Mismanagement could destabilise the delicate balance of these ecosystems. This is crucial, considering the intricate relationship between the blue economy and marine habitats. Neglect puts fish resources at risk and endangers vital sectors like maritime transport, energy and fishing. Cooperation and commitment to stewardship are therefore imperative to maintaining the health and productivity of the oceans.
What benefits will Nigerians feel if these steps are taken?
Oil is a key revenue source for the country. But it has led to major environmental problems. Harnessing the blue economy could be a game changer for Nigeria.
First, it could create jobs and generate income from fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, shipping and renewable energy.
Second, a blue economy could mitigate environmental damage as it enables the restoration of marine ecosystems. Unlike oil, fisheries are renewable. Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta has experienced severe environmental harm. A shift to greener energy supplies could make a massive difference.
Third, it creates the opportunity to grow the tourism sector. Seychelles and Mauritius are examples of countries that earn foreign exchange from marine exports and tourism.
Fourth, it could help attract investment to Nigeria’s marine infrastructure, fisheries and technology.
Fifth, it could help decrease regional and social inequalities in coastal communities.
Finally, investment in the blue economy could encourage marine biology, oceanography and marine technology research. This could, in turn, lead to global innovations.
Despite competition from more experienced countries in the marine industry, the blue economy offers Nigeria significant potential. Strategic planning, global partnerships and investment can make it a reality.",Nigeria’s new blue economy ministry could harness marine resources - moving the focus away from oil,business + economy
"With all the terrible news on climate change, it’s easy to lose track of what’s happening with particular species. So, in case you missed it, a new report has bad news for Earth’s five surviving species of rhino.
Poaching for rhino horn continues to threaten populations of rhino in Africa, and the two smallest and most endangered species of rhino – the Sumatran rhino and the Javan rhino – tread ever closer to being unable to sustain themselves in the wild, due to habitat loss and low population sizes.
While we should never become desensitised to wildlife crime, environmental destruction and species extinctions, there is also some remarkable news. Conservation charity African Parks recently bought the largest private collection of rhino in the world: the Platinum Rhino farm at Klerksdorp, near Johannesburg in South Africa, previously owned by South African businessman John Hume.
African Parks plans to release the total Platinum Rhino ranch population, currently 2,000 rhino (amounting to roughly 15% of the global white rhino population), into the wild across Africa over the next ten years. That is good news. As an ecologist, I don’t see the point in conserving a wild species to keep in captivity. Wildlife belongs in the wild.
Hume’s plan to buy up and breed farmed rhino might have allowed him to sell horns for a profit once legal international trade was permitted. But that didn’t happen.
The international ban on trading rhino horn, enacted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), has held firm, despite lobbying by Hume and others. These critics were joined by some conservationists who believe that the best or only way to save rhino is by legalising the trade in their horns. The logic here is that legalisation would flood the market with legal rhino horn, devaluing illegal horns and slashing the profits of poachers and wildlife traffickers. With that, the incentive to kill rhino would shrink.

Hume continued to expand his private rhino farm and used his increasing rhino population as leverage in his calls for legalisation. But with the ban on international trade intact, Hume seems to have ran out of patience. The Platinum Rhino collection was put up for online auction in April 2023 at a starting price of US$10 million (£8.1 million). It failed to attract bids.
That may reflect the problem that rhino face: if people can’t make money out of rhino, nobody is going to want to pay to look after them. But it also highlights a problem driven by farming wildlife for profit, otherwise known as game ranching: if the profits fall, what happens to the animals?

Into the wild
After its failure to sell at auction, the largest private collection of rhino in the world was bought by African Parks. But the charity’s plan to rewild these rhino will not be easy.
A number of years ago I was involved in what was, at the time, the largest private translocation of rhino. The team I worked with moved tens of rhino; the African Parks mission is a lot bigger.
A delicate operation. Jason Gilchrist., Author provided (no reuse)
African Parks manages an area of 20 million hectares spread across 22 national parks and protected areas over 12 countries. They will contain suitable savanna grassland for releasing the rhino and the charity has already reintroduced rhino to parks in Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo and Malawi.
Conservation scientists recently said there is “a clear need to scale up rewilding initiatives”. It doesn’t get much bigger than reintroducing thousands of rhino across Africa. Rhino can play a key role in restoring the ecosystems into which they are placed, greatly influencing a network of species around them and healing ecological wounds incurred via people.
This is the nature of rewilding: restoring the linkages that make up ecosystems. Restored megafauna (large herbivorous mammals, in this case) can also help address climate change by enhancing how much habitats naturally store carbon, through dispersing seeds and enriching the soil.
Restoring megafauna is tricky, and in a recent scientific paper conservationists argued for changes in policy to support it. They suggest “a transition from farming to wildlife ranching, combined with ambitious breeding programs for keystone megafauna”. The Platinum Rhino population may well turn out to be a flagship in showing that such an approach is achievable.
Where will the rhino go? Will they be released into areas where rhino are locally extinct, or supplement existing populations? Can they be used to fulfil the role vacated by the functionally extinct northern white rhino (subspecies)?
Time will tell. In the meantime, the farmed rhino need to be prepared to cope with the stress of translocation and release, and for a wild life. They need to be toughened, to find and process food from the natural environments in which they will be placed. They will need to tolerate the challenges of their new environments, such as disease, parasites and predators.
The most dangerous predator of rhino remains the human species. The conundrum of how to stop or even simply reduce the loss of free-living rhino to poachers remains. The soon-to-be-released rhino will have to deal with this – with traditional anti-poaching conservation support. Alongside that, demand reduction efforts must continue in order to bring down the desire for rhino horn.

"The world is losing animals at an alarming rate due to habitat degradation, climate change and illegal human activities in the wildlife protected areas. In fact, it is estimated that, by 2100, more than half of Africa’s bird and mammal species could be lost.
Efforts to conserve biodiversity depend on information about which animals are where. Tracking wildlife is instrumental. Existing tracking methods include camera trapping and line transects, which are specific areas and designed trails respectively, that can be revisited from time to time to monitor habitat conditions and species changes. These methods can be expensive, labour intensive, time consuming and difficult to use, and might not detect all the species that are present in an area. Dense rainforests present a particular problem for tracking, since the vegetation is often very thick and doesn’t let much light in.
Recent research has shown that vertebrates leave their DNA in the environment, both as airborne particles and on vegetation. This offers a useful new way to monitor species.
Our international research team, working in the rainforest of Uganda’s Kibale National Park, wondered whether the environmental DNA methods would be useful to us. We reasoned that if animal DNA was in the air, perhaps it settled and got stuck to leaves. Waxy, sticky or indented leaf surfaces might even be ideal DNA traps. Would simply swabbing leaves collect enough DNA to monitor species and map biodiversity?
Our study demonstrated that many birds and mammals can be detected using this simple, low tech method. It’s a promising tool for large-scale biomonitoring efforts.
Kibale National Park
Kibale National Park in Uganda is famous for its rich biodiversity and has earned its place as the “primate capital” of the world. It is home to 13 species of non-human primates including the endangered Red colobus monkey and chimpanzees.
To test our idea, the research team went into the park’s dense tropical forest armed with 24 cotton buds. Our task was to swab as many leaves as possible with each bud in three minutes.
Swabbing leaves for DNA in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Patrick Omeja
To tell which animals gave rise to the DNA in the swabs, the team sequenced a short piece of DNA, called a barcode. Barcodes are distinct for each animal, so the barcode found in the swabs could be compared to a barcode library containing all animals sampled to date.
The team didn’t expect great results, because in rainforest conditions – hot by day, cold at night, humid and wet – DNA degrades quickly.
So we were surprised when the results came back from the DNA sequencer. We’d picked up over 50 species of mammals and birds and a frog, with swabs collected in just over an hour, on only 24 cotton buds.
We detected nearly eight animal species on each of the cotton buds. These species spanned a huge diversity, from the very large and endangered African elephant to a very small species of sunbird.
Detected animals included the hammer-headed fruit bat, which has a wing-span of up to one metre, monkeys like the elusive L’Hoest’s monkey and the endangered ashy red colobus, as well as rodents such as the forest giant squirrel. A great variety of birds was detected too, including the great blue turaco and the endangered gray parrot.

The high diversity of animals, coupled with the impressive animal detection rate per swab, suggests we can now collect a lot of animal DNA simply from leaves. The ease of sampling, a task we can ask anyone on our team to do quickly when they are in the forest, suggests we could use this method to track animal diversity in the park, particularly in areas that are rapidly changing.
One of the team members, Emmanuel Opito, is studying exactly these areas in the park for his doctoral project. He is trying to understand how the invasive Lantana camara and the woody herb Acanthus pubescens inhibit forest regeneration. With this leaf swabbing method, it will be easier to explore how removing invasive species and allowing the forest to regenerate will help animal biodiversity recover.
Easy way to gather information
Monitoring animal populations is crucial to comprehend the scale of ecosystem changes and to guide the development of effective management strategies. New technologies like these environmental DNA approaches offer promising support for these efforts.
Because leaf swabbing does not require fancy and expensive equipment or much training to carry out, it can easily be carried out by the staff at Uganda Wildlife Authority, field assistants or biologists working in the forest.
The method can also be scaled up because DNA sequencing technology is becoming more accessible and affordable post-COVID-19. There is a lot of potential for environmental DNA to contribute to biodiversity monitoring at a much larger scale and to inform biodiversity management initiatives.","Wild animals leave DNA on plants, making them easier to track – here’s what scientists found in a Ugandan rainforest",environment + energy
"More than 11,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands are missing following the catastrophic collapse of two dams in the eastern Libyan city of Derna. The dam collapse came after an extreme storm, Storm Daniel, slammed into the north African country. The Conversation Africa’s Moina Spooner asked water resources and engineering expert Nadhir Al-Ansari, who has researched the design and safety of dams, to provide insights into the disaster.
How does extreme weather affect the stability of dams?
Dams are usually built to withstand heavy rainfall or drought. The design and construction of a dam takes into consideration all possible effects. All factors, including the type of building materials, the design of the foundation and the stability of a dam, as well as expected floods and earthquakes and even military action, are taken into consideration when planning a dam.
Aside from how the dam is constructed, there should be safety provisions in place. For instance, in cases of storms, the engineers should release the water to ensure that a dam’s maximum carrying capacity is not exceeded.
In the Libyan case, I believe that the management of the dams was not good. The engineer responsible for the dam should have made sure the water did not exceed the dam’s upper carrying capacity. When he noticed that a huge volume of water was entering the reservoir he should have released large quantities of water to keep its level lower than the upper limit.
Research shows that the main causes of dam failure are foundation problems (40%), inadequate spillway (23%), poor construction (12%) and uneven settlement (10%). A site for a dam will not always be level because dams are built in mountain areas, but the designers must take that into consideration. The dam design must suit the topography. Among the rarer causes of dam failures are acts of war (3%), defective material (2%) and earthquakes (1%).
In Libya’s case, bad management appears to have been the cause of the dam’s collapse.
Could this tragedy have been avoided?
Yes, if the responsible people operating the dams had opened the gates to release water. When those responsible for the water management of the dam ignore heavy rainfall then one can expect such disasters to occur.
Dam managers should also know each dam’s catchment area and how much rainfall is forecast. This requires coordination between meteorologists and the staff responsible for the management of dams. When heavy rainfall is expected, the meteorology department should inform dam managers who can then make arrangements for the release of water to keep it within the dam’s operational limits. This is the usual practice in all the dams I’ve studied in Iraq.
In this case, there must have been a breakdown in communication between meteorological department and engineers managing the dams.
How do engineers and authorities typically monitor the structural integrity of dams?
Dams should have a regular inspection programme that takes into consideration all parts of the dam. All countries with dams, whether in the US, Iraq or Sweden, have regular inspections. There should be instruments for monitoring cracks in a dam’s walls and any changes in its structure. Once identified, they must be attended to immediately.
In Libya’s case, if they had opened the sluice gates to keep water within the dam’s carrying capacity, the collapse of the dams would have caused less damage.
Are there emerging technologies or innovations to improve safety?
There are a number of models and techniques and each dam has its own model or technique that the designer suggests. Planning for extreme weather events is usually done at the design stage of the dam. The designer is meant to give a thorough report on the stability of the dam against various factors, including weather.
Different scenarios are given according to the water level in the reservoir of the dam to prevent dam failure. The government concerned should know what to do in case of dam failure, guided by the design information. For instance, in my study of Iraq’s Mosul dam, which took place after the dam was constructed, I suggested that a protection dam be built downstream to secure the safety of the downstream area and its population. Safety steps can be taken even after construction of the dam.
The other safety measures relate to housing and other developments in areas downstream. In Libya’s case, there was poor planning. The areas downstream from the dams should not have been used for housing.
Ultimately, the dam failure in Libya could have been prevented, or at least the losses could have been minimised, if the engineers on site had released the water from the reservoir once the storm started.",Libya dam collapse: engineering expert raises questions about management,environment + energy
"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital city, will likely face increased heatwaves, droughts and severe flooding over the next 67 years. These changes will pose risks to public health and infrastructure. They’ll also be felt most acutely by the city’s most vulnerable residents: those living in informal settlements.
Addis Ababa is one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa, and its current metropolitan population of about 5.4 million is projected to reach close to 9 million by 2035.
This increase in the city’s population will be absorbed by informal settlements, the prime destination for most migrants. And informal settlements are characterised by poor or non-existent infrastructure, and face the twin challenges of worsening climate change and poor urban environmental policy.
To investigate the city’s vulnerability to climate change, researchers at Tufts University and the Woodwell Climate Research Center analysed flood risk and temperature data for different time periods, projecting from the past to the future.
We predicted that the city’s extreme daily maximum temperatures would increase by about 1.7°C over the period 2040-2060, compared with 2000–2020. An increase of 1.7°C would result in a rise in the frequency, duration, and intensity of heatwaves. In addition, higher temperatures contribute to increased water vapour and transpiration. This will threaten health, ecosystems, infrastructure, livelihoods, and food supplies.
Certain southern neighbourhoods, such as Akaki-Kaliti, Bole and Nifas Silk-Lafto, have experienced notably higher temperatures, especially during the warm season from March to May. And, looking to the future, temperature projections for Nifas Silk-Lafto suggest an average temperature increase to 26.21°C between 2040 and 2060, and further increase to 27.78°C from 2070 to 2090 and 27.78°C from 2070 to 2090.
Figure 1. Daily maximum temperature distributions for Addis. (a) Annual. (b) March, April, and May (warmest season) of Addis Ababa. Yimere, Author provided (no reuse)
For the warm-season months of March, April, and May, a temperature increase of 1.8°C is projected. This suggests that the peak temperature for the hottest day of the year will rise by an average of 1.8°C compared to recent data. From 2000 to 2020 the average temperature in the Nifas Silk-Lafto sub-city was 24.70°C.
Increases in temperatures of this magnitude will lead to public health challenges such as increased malaria risks, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, and women.
More droughts
Over the past two decades, Addis Ababa has endured an average of three months of extreme drought yearly. Using the Palmer Drought Severity Index to assess temperature and precipitation data in a geographical area, our analysis suggests that extreme drought events will become more frequent between 2040 and 2060. The city is expected to experience an additional 1.6 months of extreme drought annually, a 53% increase compared with 2000-2020.
This rising frequency of droughts, along with the city’s growing population, is intensifying water insecurity. Groundwater reserves for drought emergencies are already being depleted.
These droughts will affect health, hydroelectric energy production and urban agriculture.
Flooding
Too much rainfall, particularly if it occurs within a short period of time in an urban area, leads to flooding. Flooding poses a significant environmental risk to Addis Ababa, especially because the city has developed around three primary rivers.
Climate change will increase water-related challenges by affecting the flow of rivers and the replenishment of groundwater.
Currently, 67% of the population in Addis lives in flood prone areas. The parts of the city that are most at risk include central Addis, which has the greatest density of impervious surfaces like tarmac and concrete. These contribute to flood risk because water can’t seep into the ground.
Other parts of the city that are at risk include the southern half – where the slope is relatively flatter, so water doesn’t flow away – and the Nifas Silk-Lafto region, where considerable development has taken place in the floodplain.
Several factors will add to the flooding challenge. The city has inadequate sewerage infrastructure and weak drainage systems which are often obstructed by solid waste.
The impact
The effects on the city’s residents will be substantial.
Health is just one example.
Our data show that average temperatures in the city will make year-round malaria transmission a risk. There will have to be sustained policy measures to deal with the risk.
Figure 2. Observed malaria incidence rate in Addis Ababa. Yimere, Author provided (no reuse)
Older adults and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. The elderly are more sensitive to heat and pollution due to existing health conditions, limited mobility, and compromised immune systems. Pregnant women face risks from thermal variations and mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria and Zika.
Read more: Climate change will cause more African children to die from hot weather
Many urban residents will be prone to increasing floods. Already 10% of the city’s newly developed areas are within a 100-year floodplain, threatening lives and infrastructures.
People living in informal settlements are particularly at risk – that’s about 70% of Addis Ababa’s residents. These settlements crop up in limited and unused spaces, such as riverbanks. They are at a higher risk of flood impact, and the risk is growing.
Our data shows that currently the percentage difference in vulnerability between formal and informal settlements is 0.6%. The figure illustrates the extent to which buildings within formal and informal settlements would be affected by flooding events. It is expected to rise to 1.3% by 2050 and 1.6% by 2080.
Policy recommendations
There’s an urgent need for policies that can rise to these challenges. We suggest:
the government should establish a climate adaptation and resilience office, to integrate climate resilience into urban planning
an independent body should then assess policies in practice
a water management strategy to ensure equitable access and sustainable use of water
the city should invest in green infrastructure

"South Africa is renowned for having one of the world’s biggest populations of great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias). Substantial declines have been observed, however, in places where the sharks normally gather on the coast of the Western Cape province. Sharks congregate at these locations to feed, interact socially, or rest.
In Cape Town, skilled “shark spotters” documented a peak of over 300 great white shark sightings across eight beaches in 2011, but have recorded no sightings since 2019. These declines have sparked concerns about the overall conservation status of the species.
Conserving great white sharks is vital because they have a pivotal role in marine ecosystems. As top predators, they help maintain the health and balance of marine food webs. Their presence influences the behaviour of other marine animals, affecting the entire ecosystem’s structure and stability.
Marine biologists like us needed to know whether the decline in shark numbers in the Western Cape indicated changes in the whole South African population or whether the sharks had moved to a different location.
To investigate this problem, we undertook an extensive study using data collected by scientists, tour operators and shore anglers. We examined the trends over time in abundance and shifts in distribution across the sharks’ South African range.
Our investigation revealed significant differences in the abundance at primary gathering sites. There were declines at some locations; others showed increases or stability. Overall, there appears to be a stable trend. This suggests that white shark numbers have remained constant since they were given protection in 1991.
Looking at the potential change in the distribution of sharks between locations, we discovered a shift in human-shark interactions from the Western Cape to the Eastern Cape. More research is required to be sure whether the sharks that vanished from the Western Cape are the same sharks documented along the Eastern Cape.
Shark trends in South Africa. Bowlby HD, et al., Author provided (no reuse)
The stable population of white sharks is reassuring, but the distribution shift introduces its own challenges, such as the risk posed by fisheries, and the need for beach management. So there is a need for better monitoring of where the sharks are.
Factors influencing shark movements
We recorded the biggest changes between 2015 and 2020. For example, at Seal Island, False Bay (Western Cape), shark sightings declined from 2.5 sightings per hour in 2005 to 0.6 in 2017. Shifting eastward to Algoa Bay, in 2013, shore anglers caught only six individual sharks. By 2019, this figure had risen to 59.
The changes at each site are complex, however. Understanding the patterns remains challenging.
These predators can live for more than 70 years. Each life stage comes with distinct behaviours: juveniles, especially males, tend to stay close to the coastline, while sub-adults and adults, particularly females, venture offshore.
Environmental factors like water temperature, lunar phase, season and food availability further influence their movement patterns.
Changes in the climate and ocean over extended periods might also come into play.
As adaptable predators, they target a wide range of prey and thrive in a broad range of temperatures, with a preference for 14–24°C. Their migratory nature allows them to seek optimal conditions when faced with unfavourable environments.
Predation of sharks by killer whales
The movement complexity deepens with the involvement of specialist killer whales with a taste for shark livers. Recently, these apex predators have been observed preying on white, sevengill and bronze whaler sharks.
Cases were first documented in 2015 along the South African coast, coinciding with significant behavioural shifts in white sharks within Gansbaai and False Bay.
Although a direct cause-and-effect link is not firmly established, observations and tracking data support the notion of a distinct flight response among white sharks following confirmed predation incidents.
More recently, it was clear that in Mossel Bay, when a killer whale pod killed at least three white sharks, the remaining sharks were prompted to leave the area.
Survival and conservation of sharks
The risk landscape for white sharks is complex. A study published in 2022 showed a notable overlap of white sharks with longline and gillnet fisheries, extending across 25% of South Africa’s Exclusive Economic Zone. The sharks spent 15% of their time exposed to these fisheries.
The highest white shark catches were reported in KwaZulu-Natal, averaging around 32 per year. This emphasised the need to combine shark movement with reliable catch records to assess risks to shark populations.
As shark movement patterns shift eastward, the potential change in risk must be considered. Increased overlap between white sharks, shark nets, drumlines (baited hooks) and gillnets might increase the likelihood of captures.
Beach safety and management adaptation
Although shark bites remain a low risk, changing shark movements could also influence beach safety. The presence of sharks can influence human activities, particularly in popular swimming and water sports areas. Adjusting existing shark management strategies might be necessary as distributions change.
Increased signage, temporary beach closures, or improved education about shark behaviour might be needed.

In Cape Town, for example, shark spotters have adjusted their efforts on specific beaches. Following two fatal shark incidents in 2022, their programme expanded to Plettenberg Bay. Anecdotal evidence highlights additional Eastern Cape locations where surfers and divers encounter more white sharks than before.
Enhanced monitoring and long-term programmes
Further research is required to understand the factors behind the movements of sharks and their impact on distribution over space and time. Our study underscores the importance of standardising data collection methods to generate reliable abundance statistics across their entire range. Other countries suffer from the same problem.
Additionally, we propose establishing long-term monitoring programmes along the Eastern Cape and continuing work to reduce the number of shark deaths.

"Hydropower provides clean electricity to millions in Africa. It’s the largest source of renewable energy on the continent and accounts for nearly one quarter of total electricity generation in sub-Saharan Africa. Some countries, however, have a much heavier reliance on it than others. For instance, hydropower accounts for at least 80% of electricity generation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia.
The continent has a lot more hydropower potential too. With relatively abundant water resources, sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to have 1.4 petawatt hours a year of untapped, low cost potential. To put this into perspective, 1 PWh of energy could power about half a billion households for one year, assuming each household consumes an average of about 5.5 kWh per day.
However, there are political and environmental concerns that planners must consider if they want to expand hydropower. The tensions between Ethiopia and downstream countries in the Nile River basin, following the construction of the colossal Grand Renaissance Dam, are emblematic of this.
As a researcher who studies the linkages between energy systems and climate change, I’ve written a paper that highlights why using or increasing dependency on hydropower involves climate-related risks.
The global and regional climate is getting more extreme. Events such as droughts and floods are becoming more frequent. Worryingly, energy planning and management is not keeping pace with such changes in most African countries.
Climate change threat to hydropower
Hydroelectricity is generated by harnessing the kinetic energy of water. This water may come from rivers or water that’s been stored in natural or artificial basins. Water flows through turbines which spin. The kinetic energy of the moving water is converted into mechanical energy and eventually into electrical energy.
A dam’s power output is, therefore, very sensitive to extreme changes in river and water availability. It’s also sensitive to permanent changes in the weather from when it was constructed.
I carried out an extensive review of existing studies on the projected impacts of climate change on hydropower in different areas of sub-Saharan Africa. This included its impact on output, reliability and future hydropower prospects.
I found that the impact on hydropower output varies across regions. Countries in east Africa could benefit from a wetter climate in terms of hydropower output. On the other hand, there are serious concerns that countries in southern Africa and western Africa will face a drier climate. This would bring negative impacts. Drops in water levels mean turbines will operate at lower rates and therefore produce less electricity. Central Africa would be the least affected sub-region in terms of precipitation change and drought incidence.
The expected changes in precipitation levels and patterns are uncertain, however. Different climate models and scenarios offer a mixed picture of how the future might unfold, particularly over central and southwestern Africa. Still, there is consensus that extreme hydrological events will increase throughout the continent with climate change. This will make power systems less reliable, unless there’s proper planning in place.
Several countries are more at risk than others because they depend largely, or entirely, on hydropower generation and have few back-up options available. These include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique and Sierra Leone. Some might even increase their dependency on hydropower.
Only some countries have made progress in diversifying their energy mix. Kenya, for instance, has developed and continues to plan for significant alternative renewable capacity.
Planning and management of power supply
Several planning and management actions are needed to prepare for the effects of climate change on hydropower. This will ensure that citizens in sub-Saharan Africa benefit from a more reliable power supply.
First, hydropower-dependent countries need to accelerate their efforts to diversify their power mix. A new study demonstrated that African countries should increase investments in other renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. The study finds that in many areas, such as in the Zambezi and Niger river basins, renewables are becoming cost competitive or even cheaper than hydropower. The objective of investing in renewable sources of electricity is in line with the African Union’s Agenda 2063.
Second, countries must address inadequate power transmission infrastructure. This contributes to the lack of resilience. Countries could benefit from transboundary power trading opportunities among different sources of renewable energy. For instance dry spells, leading to reduced river streamflow, might coincide with high solar PV outputs in neighbouring countries, or vice versa. This will require both adequate generation and transmission infrastructure in different countries. It’ll also need a high level of coordination among different power producers and countries.
Finally, it’s essential to include a nexus approach in power system planning. For example, when planning new hydropower projects, policymakers must assess the future need for water in farming and cities. They should also assess the potential risks of multiple sectors needing water simultaneously.
Overall, power system planners must work with a robust framework that accounts for the inter-dependencies between hydropower, water availability and climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Different actions can increase the resilience of hydropower infrastructure and ensure a reliable and sustainable power supply.

"Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger share a biosphere reserve known as the WAP complex (W-Arly-Pendjari), which spreads across the borders of the three countries. The first part of this 3 million hectare Unesco world heritage site was declared in 1996 and it was extended in 2002. It’s intended to protect species that are highly threatened in the region, including elephants and cheetahs, as well as important wetlands.
The three states signed an agreement in 2008 to manage the reserve’s natural resources together, for the purposes of local, national and regional development.
The territory has been afflicted by violence and insecurity for some ten years. This trouble has spilled over from the “three borders” area shared by Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, where armed Islamist groups have been operating.
Due to the steady encroachment of non-state armed groups, the conflict is threatening to engulf the reserve. Forest resources are being plundered and people who live near the protected areas are being displaced.
As part of a study of causes of migration in and from the region, I investigated the local impact of armed groups, focusing on W Park, part of the WAP complex. I interviewed local people about the implications of poaching activities and the use of violence in forest reserves.
My opinion is that an “economy of armed groups”, which can be called a “jihadism of protected areas”, is being set up. It is dangerously disrupting environmental protection.
The armed groups have opened trafficking routes and launched attacks on local communities. They have taken over activities such as gold panning, hunting and fishing and targeted forest eco-guards. All this has had a direct impact on people and led to deteriorating social conditions. Authorities need to coordinate national responses to safeguard the reserve and restore social cohesion among local communities.

Serious threat to protected forest areas
The transboundary area came under multiple pressures decades ago, such as harvesting wood, hunting, poaching, fishing, collecting medicinal plants and illegal mining. The level of exploitation was threatening the ecosystems. In response, the countries adopted a regional approach to coordinate national policies. Local people were to participate in the common management of resources. This approach was outlined in the 2000 Tapoa Declaration and again in 2008.
But another form of pressure has also grown. Today, armed groups seriously threaten the future of the reserve, its conservation and the sustainability of its activities and development. They have “colonised” this natural geographical area, living inside the remote uncontrolled protected areas and exploiting resources. They often commit abuses on unprotected populations.
The armed groups are not the sole causes of this current situation. Based on my field research in the region over the years, I argue that it is also the result of the political management by the three states.
Contributing to the political and social instability are:
land grabs in the areas surrounding protected forest areas
a pastoralism crisis which increases competition with crop farmers
inconsistency in the distribution and regulation of forest resources between local residents and state representatives
a poorly integrated approach to the biosphere.
War entrepreneurship
Since 2018, the Katiba Ansar-ul Islam and the Katiba Serma have been the two armed groups most visible in northern Benin, south-eastern Burkina Faso and western Niger. A kind of “war entrepreneurship” is being set up. It draws on natural resources (wood, rare plants, illegal fishing, gold panning), but also causes forced migration in already vulnerable populations. Protected areas have become sanctuaries for recruiting local fighters and planning attacks. According to most of the people I interviewed, the armed groups also consider the forest eco-guards as predators who have oppressed the local populations since the colonial era. Some guards have been killed, others recruited into the armed groups.

The armed groups rely on income from forest products exploitation, illegally extracted gold and zakat – taxes demanded from locals. They also force local people to pledge allegiance to their cause and make them move from their places to remote areas such as the protected reserves. There, migrants also exploit the natural resources.
What has developed is a parallel political economy in areas controlled by armed groups.
Way forward
Among the initiatives to combat non-state armed groups, our policy report suggested the following solutions:
make forest villages inaccessible to two-wheeled motorcycles, the main means of transport for armed groups
set up forest tunnels or corridors where people can hide when under threat
re-adopt an integrated and inclusive approach to forest ecology, animal protection and cross-border security
strengthen social cohesion between communities in Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger by defusing the driving factors of insurgency and restoring mutual trust.",Jihadist groups threaten the conservation of a key west African world heritage site - new study,environment + energy
"Climate change has negatively – and irreversibly, in some cases – affected ecosystems around the globe. Sadly, though, it is not the only phenomenon that’s altering our natural world.
In 2019, the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment Report confirmed invasive alien species as one of the five most important direct drivers of biodiversity loss. The others were climate change, land and sea use, direct exploitation of species, and pollution.
IPBES, an independent intergovernmental body, was established in 2012. It now has 144 member countries; Somalia, the newest member, joined in mid-September. Its major objective is to strengthen the interface between science and policy to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity.
The 2019 assessment found that more than 37,000 alien species had been introduced by many human activities to regions and biomes around the world, most in the past 100 years. A new report by the organisation, focused on alien invasive species, suggests this number is rising fast, with new alien species being recorded at an unprecedented rate of approximately 200 annually. It also reveals that the global economic cost of invasive alien species exceeded US$423 billion annually. Costs have at least quadrupled every decade since 1970.
But the new report doesn’t just concentrate on problems. It also offers solutions. It outlines key responses and policy options that governments may take for prevention, early detection and effective control of invasive alien species. Doing so will help to safeguard nature and its contributions to people. This will ensure a better quality of life for all.
Read more: The true damage of invasive alien species was just revealed in a landmark report. Here's how we must act
I am an invasion biologist whose research focuses on the ecology and management of invasive aquatic plants. Here, I elaborate on the four key messages highlighted by the report that African countries should heed if the continent is to successfully tackle the threats posed by invasive species.
Key messages
1: Invasive alien species are a major threat to nature, its contributions to people, and good quality of life.
In Africa, invasive species threaten food security by negatively affecting fish production, agricultural productivity, grazing and water supplies.
The introduction of the Nile perch, Lates niloticus, into East Africa’s Lake Victoria in 1954 is one of the most extreme examples. Predation by this species caused the extinction of approximately 200 species of cichlids from the lake. It is considered to represent the largest extinction event among vertebrates during the 20th century.
The invasion also resulted in the shallow lake becoming enriched with nutrients as people came to fish for Nile perch. This resulted in the widespread invasion of the lake by water hyacinth. The plant restricted access to the lake, which prevented transport and fishing.
2: Globally, invasive alien species and their impacts are increasing rapidly and are predicted to continue rising in the future. Accurate data is crucial.
A 2021 research study highlighted that the reported economic costs of invasive aquatic species were unevenly distributed across geographic regions. Africa, the Oceania-Pacific Islands and the Antarctic-Subantarctic, combined, accounted for only 0.6% of the US$345 billion global estimate. That’s not because the costs are really that low. The data simply isn’t being recorded, so we’re not getting the full picture.
African countries need to partner with their neighbours in better quantifying the situation.
3: Invasive alien species and their negative impact can only be prevented and mitigated through effective management.
In 2011 the Convention on Biological Diversity released its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The 20 targets were designed to address and mitigate biodiversity loss across the globe. Target 9 stated that, by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways should be identified and prioritised. Priority species should be controlled or eradicated, and measures taken to block new pathways.
But none of those targets were met. And there has been little or no progress recorded in some African countries. Today, invasive species are reported to be adversely affecting livelihoods in more than 70% of African countries.
Constrained financial resources and the lack of legal frameworks and related operational systems are largely to blame for the lack of progress. For example, there is a huge lack of capacity, mainly at ports of entry – which are the most crucial step in preventing invasions.
Many regions still have to enhance their management plans for effective control of invasive species, starting with identification of common invasive species.
4: There are success stories on the continent – lessons should be shared across borders.
In South Africa, the management of alien plant invasions has been actively supported by the government’s Working for Water programme since 1995.
Read more: Invasive alien plants in South Africa pose huge risks, but they can be stopped
A study in 2022 estimated that an average of R310 million (adjusted to 2020 values) had been spent every year on work that covered 2.7 million hectares across more than 76,000 sites. This doesn’t mean plant invasions are totally under control. But it is clear that, without this kind of programme, the situation would be far worse.
The study recommended that the programme’s future efforts must focus on clearly defined priority sites, improving planning and monitoring, and increasing operational efficiency. These are all valuable lessons for other African countries.
An African lens
Its new report did not focus on any one part of the world, but IPBES has previously been clear about the importance of biodiversity to African nations. In a 2018 regional assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services For Africa, the organisation wrote that
biodiversity and nature’s contributions in Africa are economically, socially and culturally important, essential in providing the continent’s food, water, energy, health and secure livelihood, and represent a strategic asset for sustainable development and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Most of the data in the newest report comes from the northern hemisphere, as this is where most of the research is conducted, and where the majority of funding comes from.
Different countries and regions will have different needs. That’s where the value of regional coordination and knowledge-sharing becomes clear.",Invasive alien species are a serious threat to the planet: 4 key messages for Africa,environment + energy
"The dumping of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere yearly is already having a devastating impact around the world. This includes widespread flooding and droughts, raging wildfires, heatwaves and record temperatures.
Africa is particularly hard hit, with temperatures and sea levels rising faster across the continent than the global average.
In Zimbabwe, unreliable rainfalls and extended droughts are affecting hydro electricity generation, resulting in rolling blackouts. Food production is also affected. A large fraction of Zimbabwe’s population is at risk of severe hunger.
In 2015, almost all countries signed the Paris Agreement, a commitment to tackle climate change. The intention was to limit global temperature increase to below 2°C, or ideally 1.5°C. To achieve this, countries submitted individual plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions, to reduce their contribution to climate change. They agreed to update them every five years.
The continent of Africa contributes 2%-3% of the global greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. Zimbabwe contributes less than 0.1%. Despite this small contribution, all African countries submitted their plans to reduce emissions.
In 2015, Zimbabwe committed to reducing its emissions by 33% by 2030. In 2021, it updated the target to a 40% reduction by 2030 across all sectors. This significant improvement increases the fraction of emissions that Zimbabwe will reduce from all emitting sectors.
The energy sector is responsible for about 34% of Zimbabwe’s total emissions. Including other sectors, like agriculture and forestry (58% of total emissions), waste (5%) and industrial processes (3%) will substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions if Zimbabwe achieves its target.
How Zimbabwe can meet its emission reduction target
The updated target was informed by an assessment of how greenhouse gas emission could be reduced. The assessment was done by a team of researchers from Zimbabwe and the Stockholm Environment Institute at the University of York (including myself). It provided a clear plan to achieve the targets through the implementation of 28 specific policies and measures.
We assessed the benefits of these actions to mitigate climate change. We also reviewed other implications of taking each action locally in Zimbabwe.
Our research showed that by implementing its climate change plan, Zimbabwe would not only meet its international obligations, but achieve a broad set of health, social and development benefits.
The study assessed and quantified how the 28 actions to achieve Zimbabwe’s climate change plan would contribute to specific Sustainable Development Goals.
The top three benefits identified were improved public health, enhanced biodiversity, and greater access to reliable energy supplies. Each of these benefits is a priority within Zimbabwe’s National Development Strategy 1 2021-2025.
Good health is a constitutional right in Zimbabwe. Air pollution and unsafe sanitation are among the top 10 risk factors for health in Zimbabwe, and can be reduced by carrying out Zimbabwe’s climate change plan.
Reducing biodiversity losses will not only address an environmental challenge in Zimbabwe’s National Development Strategy, but preserve and enhance the tourism industry.
After years of unreliable energy supplies due to drought, and reliance on biomass fuels for cooking for much of the population, providing regular and reliable energy supplies is critical for alleviating poverty and economic growth.
Counting the benefits
Public health: Currently, almost 6,000 infants and over 8,000 adults die yearly from air pollution in Zimbabwe. Almost 1,600 people die from road traffic accidents, and 337 people die from unsafe sanitation. The study estimates that actions reducing greenhouse gases would also reduce air pollutant emissions by between 35% and 45% by 2030. This would lead to lower air pollution exposure, especially indoors where women and girls are most exposed while cooking.
Cleaner energy for cooking, improved transport systems and improved waste management all reduce air pollution. Increasing the use of public transport, or walking and cycling, rather than using cars can reduce road accidents and greenhouse gas emissions from transport.
Expanding access to sanitation systems would reduce the number of people dying from diarrhoeal diseases, and reduce methane emissions if the correct systems were installed.
Improved biodiversity: Zimbabwe’s climate change actions also include changes to how land is used. It aims to reduce burned areas of forest by 500,000 hectares and add 100,000 hectares of natural forest every year to 2025. The plan would also manage 250,000 more hectares of cropland using sustainable “conservation agriculture” techniques.
These actions were estimated to achieve multiple benefits, including improving soil health and protecting biodiversity, with possible reduction in the losses of both animals and plants.
Access to reliable energy: Achieving Zimbabwe’s climate change plan is built on extending electricity access to 95% of urban households and 75% of rural households. Actions in the plan include the expansion of renewable electricity generation, energy efficiency improvements, and reducing losses from electricity transmission and distribution. These steps can help ensure that access to energy is quick and effective, thereby reducing blackouts and reliance on fossil fuels.
In addition, the study shows that Zimbabwe could increase recycling rates while reducing emissions from waste. The country can equally reduce the time people – predominantly women and girls – spend cooking by switching to cleaner cooking fuels.
More than a sacrifice
Tackling climate change is often viewed as a necessary sacrifice, rather than an opportunity to improve lives.
Climate change targets are often focused solely on how they contribute to global, long-term aspirations, rather than the benefits that countries can achieve in the short term.
Our study shows the social, health and development benefits that Zimbabwe could enjoy by tackling its (small) contribution to climate change. This is not unique to Zimbabwe, nor a full list of all possible benefits from climate change action.
What is notable about the Zimbabwe study is that these local benefits were evaluated and quantified, alongside greenhouse gas emission reductions. They provide a positive case of what countries can gain from taking climate action.
Integrating quantitative assessment of local benefits when countries develop their climate change plans, following Zimbabwe’s example, could help boost national climate plans. This would in turn help the world meet necessary emission reduction timelines and avoid the worst impacts.","Zimbabwe’s climate action plan: a win for the environment, health and energy",environment + energy
"All countries have a variety of water resources – some are on the surface, like rivers, and some are beneath the ground. This groundwater provides almost 50% of all global domestic use and 43% of all the water used for agriculture.
Groundwater is stored in aquifers, which come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can be accessed in several ways, but mostly by drilling wells. Not all groundwater is useful to us – it depends on whether it’s fresh or mixed with salt and on how deep it is, as this will affect how easy it is to tap into.
Read more: Africa’s aquifers hold more than 20 times the water stored in the continent's lakes, but they aren’t the answer to water scarcity
In Africa, groundwater is very important. It supports almost 100% of household and agricultural activities in rural areas. And, because it’s underground it’s protected from evaporation, a crucial resource in a warming climate.
These facts and figures are in a recent World Bank report which unpacks issues facing groundwater in times of climate change. As a groundwater scientist focusing on its sustainable use, I’ve picked out some of the key issues when it comes to managing groundwater from the report. It’s vital that African countries address these as pressure increases on the continent’s water resources, through growing populations, development and changing weather patterns.
Key issues
Ownership of groundwater
Figuring out ownership of groundwater is important for the management of this finite resource. Without a clear understanding of ownership, conflict can happen.
In some countries groundwater is owned by the landowner, in others by the government. Generally, it’s being poorly managed across the continent. In many cases, boreholes used to extract groundwater aren’t even being registered.
South Africa has used laws and policies to transfer the ownership of resources to the government. But this has led to issues around red tape and licensing permits, which determine how water is allocated.
The success of permit systems depends on a thorough understanding of the resources, property owners’ compliance with granted user rights, and the enforcement of this regulation. This is particularly problematic in the developing world, according to the World Bank report.
A possible solution is decentralised management, as seen by the Qanat system in the Middle East. The system consists of a network of underground canals that transport water from aquifers in highlands to the surface at lower levels using gravity. It is normally managed by the community and financed collectively. These historical pieces of infrastructure have been abandoned in recent times, but could solve many of the water shortage issues in the semi-arid to arid areas of Africa.
Recharging aquifers
Groundwater in aquifers is finite, but it can be recharged with surface water or treated wastewater. The process also sometimes helps in the removal of harmful chemicals because the aquifer’s material can act like a very large filter.
The World Bank report highlights managed aquifer recharge as a technique which can be used to recharge aquifers. Water is either injected through a well or seeps into the ground through infiltration ponds, man-made or natural depressions in the ground which allows water to soak into the earth.
Countries in southern Africa have practised this for the past 40 years.
Aquifers can also be recharged naturally when rainwater infiltrates deep into the ground. This can be encouraged through afforestation, agricultural terraces and the prevention of land clearing. These practices allow permeable surfaces to dominate the landscape, stabilise the soil through plant growth, and slow the flow of water.
Monitoring aquifers
Monitoring aquifers is vital to know how much water is left in them. Unfortunately many African countries have poor monitoring networks and infrastructure in place. The number of monitoring points in certain countries is also dwindling, owing to financial constraints.
Satellite data can be used for monitoring. One example is the GRACE (Gravity, Recovery and Climate Experiment) twin satellites which have provided insights into subsurface water storage over the past 20 years. This means that the changes in aquifer volumes can be monitored, but only at a very large scale. It’s necessary to know what’s happening on the ground. Localised monitoring networks are needed, with data loggers at multiple wells.
Effective policies
Policies and incentives play a major role in the use of groundwater. They influence the cost of energy and abstraction and the overall accounting of groundwater resources and environmental impact.
In an African context, good policies are missing in places. There are, however, some community practices which help to protect the resource, like the Qanat system. These types of systems should be encouraged and replicated.
Groundwater dependent ecosystems
Groundwater dependent ecosystems, such as wetlands, play a critical role for many livelihoods in Africa and need to be more effectively managed. These ecosystems use groundwater to support plant and animal life and ecosystem services, such as fresh water and clean air, throughout the year.
But they’re exposed to major risks because they’re often close to semi-arid and arid areas. This is particularly true in the Sahel region. Groundwater dependent ecosystems are often close to border crossings and transport routes. Human activities, such as over-pumping, could adversely affect how they function and lead to a loss of biodiversity.
The conservation of these water bodies is of the utmost importance for the preservation of water resources and livelihoods. Policies which protect them – like the Ramsar convention – must be properly enforced. Governments could should also consider creating protected areas around some of these ecosystems.
Managing resources
It’s imperative that governments better monitor our water resources. Coupled with good practical solutions, such as managing pump rates, this will sustain groundwater resources for many years to come.
The monitoring network on our continent is unfortunately limited or non-existent in certain countries. In some, like South Africa, the network is slowly diminishing. This is unfortunate as the ability to measure allows better management of groundwater resources.",Africa’s vast underground water resources are under pressure from climate change - how to manage them,environment + energy
"Coastlines – the interface between land and sea – lie at the frontline in the battle against climate change impacts.
Globally, almost 1 billion people now live within 10km of a coastline and the same number live in areas less than 10 metres above sea level. These populations face some of the world’s biggest climate hazards, such as coastal floods from rising sea levels and the effects of hurricanes and tropical storms, which are becoming more frequent and deadly. If there is a 2 metre increase in sea levels by 2100, this may lead to the forced migration of between 72 million and 187 million people.
However, coastlines vary substantially in their physical properties, and are found across all latitudes, environments and with a range of ecosystems and types of human activity. This means that coastline responses to climate change will vary from one place to another.
Several studies have identified sandy coastlines as particularly vulnerable to climate change, because they are made up of loose sand grains that are easily eroded by waves. A survey in 2018 showed that 24% of sandy coasts globally were already experiencing persistent net erosion because of climate change, and this was projected to get even worse in the future.
This is of concern because sandy coasts are particularly important for biodiversity, carbon storage, agriculture and tourism.
In a recent study of South African coastlines I examined the properties that contribute to their physical and biological resilience. Coastal landforms (features like estuaries, barrier islands, beaches and sand dunes) can buffer the effects of climate change and provide ecosystem and environmental services. Viewing coastal landforms as “green infrastructure” is a way to work with nature to manage the impacts of climate change.
Managing coastlines to boost resilience
Not all sandy coastlines respond in the same ways to climate, in part because they are made up of different landforms. Research shows that these landforms respond in different ways to waves, tides, sea-level change and sediment supply.
Their varied behaviours mean that a range of management responses are required to limit the impacts of climate change on these landforms, and this is the challenge facing all coasts globally in the 21st century.
However, there are some problems. Many management approaches used in the past are inappropriate or have actually made the situation worse. A classic example is where a sea wall or revetment is built along an eroding sandy coastline. This is usually a hard, high, straight structure, often built of concrete and designed to stabilise the coastline and keep the sea out. These structures often focus rather than disperse incoming wave energy, leading to increased beach erosion and undercutting of the sea wall, and requiring further and bigger structures to be built as the coast erodes even faster. Many such engineering structures designed to protect coasts are expensive, require continuous maintenance, and may have similar unintended consequences. Thus, these structures often make coastal problems worse, not better.
Instead, different approaches are needed. Working with – and not against – the natural processes and landforms that already exist along sandy coastlines may be a more effective and cheaper option. This is where natural beaches or sand dunes may protect the land against coastal erosion and be maintained by natural ecological and sedimentary processes.
In my study, I have shown how the natural landforms of different coastal environments can serve as green infrastructure: natural features that perform the same function as hard engineering structures in coastal protection. Natural beaches or sand dunes can stabilise the land surface and reduce erosion rates, provide ecosystem services and maintain biodiversity, store organic carbon, modify microclimate, and reduce the impacts of coastal hazards on local communities.
However, this approach has not been commonly used along African coasts, despite its environmental benefits.
Using coastal landforms as green infrastructure can build coastal resilience to climate change. This is a “win-win” situation for both coastal landforms and populations.
Green infrastructure
Green infrastructure is part of wider nature-based solutions to addressing environmental issues and climate change impacts. However, a number of developments are needed to make the use of green infrastructure a wider practice, but local authorities, planners and managers.
Coastlines need to be recognised as naturally dynamic, shifting environments rather than as environments that need to be controlled and managed. The multiple and varied benefits that coastlines give to the environment, ecosystems and people must be recognised, including how they relate to one another.
Coastlines therefore need to be considered as integrated and dynamic systems, not simply as the boundaries between land and sea.
And finally, not all coastlines are the same – sandy and rocky coastlines work in different ways, as do coral reef, mangrove or glaciated coasts. This means that each coastline has different elements that contribute to their overall resilience or vulnerability to climate change impacts.",World’s beaches are changing because of climate change - green thinking is needed to save them,environment + energy
"Human-wildlife conflicts are a challenge for authorities in African countries where people live near protected areas. Programmes for communities to participate in wildlife tourism and share its benefits have been put forward as one solution.
Those benefits are substantial in Tanzania. Wildlife tourism is a major source of foreign revenue for the country. In 2021, the tourism sector generated US$2.6 billion, or 5.7% of gross domestic product (GDP).
The country’s 2022 Wildlife Conservation Act offers financial and material compensation for any eligible person negatively affected by human-wildlife conflict incidents. Between 2012 and 2019, more than 1,000 human-wildlife mortality cases were reported nationwide, with rural residents forming the large majority of the victims.
As a sustainability scholar with a research interest in farming and the environment, I set out to understand the experiences of people who’d been victims of human-wildlife conflict in Tanzania. In my study, I spoke with people in the villages of Kiduhi and Mbamba. These two villages share borders with the Mikumi National Park, the fourth-biggest national park in Tanzania.
I asked them about what drives human-wildlife conflict, in their view, when and how they experienced it, how it affected their livelihood or well-being, and what could be done to prevent it in the future.
Incidents of human-wildlife conflict had become common in the two villages, but I found that the victims’ experiences were underreported. I also found that the conflict was driven by habitat losses that pushed wild animals from the park to seek food and water outside. Changing weather patterns also played a role in tensions between wild animals from the park and residents of Kiduhi and Mbamba. Other research has linked changing patterns like this to climate change.
Water scarcity and loss of grassland
Villagers in Kiduhi and Mbamba believed that a decrease in rainfall and long periods of drought were what drove elephants, hyenas and lions to seek food outside the park. This claim from residents was echoed by wildlife experts from Mikumi National Park.
They said the lack of rainfall led to a loss of vegetation inside Mikumi, forcing large animals like elephants to forage further afield. Potential prey for lions, such as deer and wildebeest, also moved far away in search of food and water. As a result, lions and hyenas from the park targeted cattle and goats in neighbouring villages.
In Kiduhi, a predominantly Maasai community that keeps livestock, hyena attacks and killings of goats had become frequent, endangering the lives of residents. Some reported risking their lives by patrolling at night to protect their cattle and chase away hyenas that were reported to be frequently seen in the area. One victim in Kiduhi told me:
In February 2021, a lion attacked my boma and killed 11 goats but ended up eating just one goat. Though the attack happened at midnight, the lion didn’t leave immediately; it stayed until early morning. I reported the incident to wildlife authorities, who came and freed the lion. But, to date, I have not been compensated for my loss.
Crop losses
The research also found that elephants raiding neighbouring villages’ farms was the major cause of human-elephant conflict around the park. Victims from Mbamba reported that clashes between them and elephants happened almost every day from May to August, the peak harvest season.
Since most Mbamba residents are subsistence farmers, the damage that elephants cause to their farms has a devastating impact on livelihoods. Women expressed concerns about household food shortages because most of the food they produced was damaged by elephants from the park. One woman farmer said:
For me, it happens almost every year; they raid and eat all the crops, especially maize and rice. I have now accepted that when I grow maize, I also grow for elephants because they come every season.
Poor response
In Kiduhi, most Maasai men and women interviewed in this study felt the local government and park officals had not shown concern about the livestock losses they experienced from hyena and lion attacks. Despite their quest for compensation, they had received nothing but daily promises of resolution.
In Mbamba, some villagers said they didn’t bother to report losses because no action would be taken.
What needs to be done about it
Across Africa, financial compensation for victims of human-wildlife conflicts is a popular management policy. Though some conservation experts have questioned its effectiveness, proponents of financial payments argue that ignoring victims’ economic losses could make the situation worse.
Studies in Tarangire and Serengeti national parks in Tanzania revealed that inadequate compensation schemes and limited engagement of neighbouring communities were the primary cause of retaliation killings in both parks.
So, firstly, the government needs to improve its compensation scheme.
Secondly, local climate conditions in Tanzania need attention. Longer periods of drought and water scarcity are expected in the coming years. Human-wildlife conflict cases may escalate. Despite known evidence of the devastating impact of climate change on wildlife resources, the government of Tanzania has been very slow in responding to these risks.
One practical intervention would be investing in nature-based solutions like restoring degraded land and water sources within the park and its neighbouring villages. This would reduce tensions over these resources.
Neglecting victims’ welfare, and a lack of tangible benefits of wildlife tourism to communities adjacent to protected areas, could pose a serious threat to the survival of wildlife. Concrete measures to address this complex conservation challenge are critical for Tanzania, given the significant contribution of wildlife tourism to its economy.",Conflict between humans and wildlife in Tanzania is being poorly managed – and climate change is making things worse,environment + energy
"Every day of the northern hemisphere’s summer in 2023 seems to bring a calamitous headline about the climate: heatwaves, wildfires, massive hailstorms.
Such scenes are set to become our global reality in the coming years. Scientists paint a grim picture of how human-induced climate change, combined with wider environmental degradation, will affect us all.
That, of course, includes children. However, research is still in its early stages on how, precisely, both climate change and environmental degradation relate to violence against children.
It is crucial to explore these potential intersections to spur academic and political movement in this area. Findings from such reviews, and further research that may emerge from it, could help to inform policies and interventions that can protect and support children, particularly those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and environmental shocks.
Our study
We conducted an extensive scoping review of the literature on the intersections of climate change, environmental degradation and violence against children, to see what’s known so far and what needs attention.
We explored both direct violence – physical, sexual and emotional – and structural violence; that is, rooted in inequitable and unjust systems and institutions. This approach allowed for a nuanced understanding of the implications for children in all countries. It also meant we could explore the causes and effects of climate change and environmental degradation in relation to systems, institutions, structures, norms and interactions.
The study identified five themes: hazards and disaster risk reduction; gender; climate-induced mobility or immobility; child labour; and health. What emerges clearly is that violence against children is not solely a phenomenon that intensifies during environmental shocks. It is deeply rooted in historical injustices, global systems and structures. That means it disproportionately affects those living in poverty.
1. Hazards and disaster risk reduction
Natural hazards, combined with large-scale humanitarian crises, pose immediate risks to health, life, property and the environment.
Studies have uncovered how increasing social, economic and emotional pressures in these situations expose children to higher risks of violence. This may occur in their homes or in relief shelters. It may be perpetrated by their peers, or by caregivers forcing them into labour because of the sudden need to rebuild or help make ends meet.
More knowledge is needed to inform integrated and culturally sensitive plans to protect children better from environmental hazards.
2. Gender
The effects of climate change and environmental degradation are not gender neutral. They can affect girls and boys differently. There is a growing body of work on gender-based violence and violence against women and girls in relation to climate change.
But this work tends to be centred on issues affecting female adults, conflating the term “gender” with “women”, without sufficient attention to the gendered effects of climate change on female and male children.
Existing research suggests that climate change can potentially exacerbate known drivers of child marriage in low- and lower-middle-income countries. But findings vary significantly by region. For example, there is an observed increase in child marriage motivated by the receipt of a bride price payment in sub-Saharan Africa during sudden periods of drought. In India, though, droughts have led to a decrease in child marriage to delay dowry payments.
Nuanced data about boys’ exposure to various forms of violence in the context of climate change is missing. That’s because studies tend to focus on males as perpetrators but not as victims of violence.
3. Mobility and immobility
The number of climate migrants is rising.
Research we reviewed on migration, displacement and relocation due to climate change, natural or human-induced hazards points to increased risks of violence against children within migrating families and higher exposure to it in camps and shelters. Also, separation from families or caregivers renders children and young people extremely vulnerable to violence.
Read more: Climate change, migration and urbanisation: patterns in sub-Saharan Africa
Meanwhile, immobility – when people cannot or do not want to move – has been associated in some studies with child abuse, injuries and overcrowding in slum areas.
Fear of violence in shelters can lead women to remain at home after natural hazards, increasing children’s risk of harm from the hazard or other forms of violence.
4. Child labour
Existing research indicates that child labour increases after natural hazards due to families’ reliance on child work and the absence of strategies to eliminate child labour entirely. Child labour is also prevalent in industries associated with climate change, such as agriculture, fisheries, mining, fashion and tourism.
The extent of child labour in this context, and its link to violence, remains inadequately explored in research, however, due to the hidden nature and contextual specificity of this issue.
5. Health
Children’s physical and mental health is affected by climate change. Natural hazards have been linked to poor health outcomes and increased mortality among children, particularly those younger than five.
There is emerging evidence that mental health issues, stemming from climate and environmental shocks, can lead to increased perpetration of violence against children, including domestic violence. Rising eco-anxiety among children and youth, caused by awareness of climate change and environmental degradation and fears of its consequences, adds to mental health problems.
Ways forward
By shedding light on the magnitude and pathways of these relationships, we want to underscore the urgent need for context-specific approaches and further research.
Understanding these interlinkages is essential for informing policies and interventions that can protect and support children, particularly those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and environmental shocks. By addressing the root causes of violence and prioritising the wellbeing of children in these crises, we can strive towards a safer and more sustainable future.",Climate change contributes to violence against children – here’s how,environment + energy
"The death of a lion in Kenya’s picturesque savannas rarely tugs at people’s hearts, even in a country where wildlife tourism is a key pillar of the nation’s economy. But when one of the most tracked male lions in Kenya’s famous Masaai Mara was killed on 24 July 2023 the world took notice. Known as Jesse, he was killed during a fight with a coalition of three male lions from a rival pride, drawing attention to the brutally risky and dangerous lives of male lions.
Lions are organised in family groups known as a pride. Each pride is comprised of several related lionesses. One or more adult male lions will also be present. In the public imagination, male lions are better known by their popularised image as kings of the jungle. Their bravery, strength, and size (only tigers are larger) fits this profile.
But in reality, male lions live a life far more vulnerable. One in two male lions die in the first year of life. From the moment a male lion is born it faces a gauntlet of challenges – from snakebite and hungry hyenas to infanticide at the hands of other male lions.
If a male lion makes it out of their first year of life, and then to independence at around 3, they leave their pride for a period of nomadism. Nomads lead a dangerous existence, skirting the territories of established male coalitions. Out there on their own, few will make it to the age of 10.

At no time, it seems, is the male lion safe. We know from the evidence collected by the Kenya Wildlife Trust, resident guides, and tourists that Jesse administered and received many beatings from other male lions. We also know that Jesse, who lived to the ripe old age of 12, was eventually killed by three younger, stronger lions. Life comes full circle: killers frequently become victims themselves, of younger, brasher lions, or those in larger and thus more powerful coalitions.
We are three researchers with over 50 years of combined experience in big cat ecology, conservation, and the complexities of people and wildlife living together.
We base our commentary on the extensive information gathered by conservation organisations, independent scientists and tourism guides working in the Maasai Mara. Information on Jesse has been collected mainly through sightings data compiled by these entities over time.
Often the survival of male lions will be dictated by the size and strength of their coalitions, and the make up of the lion landscape at large. This sometimes has bearing for conservation especially when lions stray out of national parks or when male lions are hunted after leaving the safety of a protected area.
The trials of a young lion
A young male lion’s biggest threat is his exposure to other male lions that aren’t their father or uncle. A host of studies from the Serengeti in Tanzania to Zimbabwe show that the most significant single cause of lion mortality in the first year of a lion’s life is attributed to other male lions that kill them during infanticide.
This involves incoming males seeking out and killing the cubs of other males or driving young males away, and attempting to take over prides. Killing cubs accelerates the onset of oestrus in pride females and so is likely to increase the reproductive success of incoming males.
Most lions that get pushed out of their pride when very young  don’t survive.
Read more: Getting closer to a much better count of Africa's lions
Cubs that survive to independence – around 3 years of age – must leave their pride for a period of nomadism. During this time, they join up with cousins, brothers, and sometimes unrelated males of similar age to form what biologists term ‘coalitions’. The power of coalitions increases dramatically with the size of the group. This power can be defined by the number of different prides these coalitions are likely to rule, the number of offspring they will sire, and the number of times they will successfully be able to defend their prides from violent incursions from neighbouring male lions and their coalitions.
The tradeoff of larger coalitions is a watering down of a male lion’s reproductive opportunities.
Examples of such powerful coalitions include the six-strong Mapogo, and five-strong Majingilane from South Africa. There is also the Lake Quintet coalition from Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania.
Contrastingly, Jesse had only one coalition mate, a lion known as Frank. The two were strong enough to kick out the duo of Dere and Barrikoi from the Offbeat pride in May 2014. After his coalition mate Frank disappeared, Jesse left the Offbeat Pride and led a largely nomadic lifestyle except when he unsuccessfully tried to take over the Rakero pride and even fought with his own son Jesse 2.
The Birmingham coalition of five male lions in the Kruger National Park of South Africa. They regularly clashed with other powerful coalitions including the famed Majingilane lion coalition.
Three laws of the wild
Mate, protect, fight. These are the three tenets most male animals live and die by in the animal kingdom  and this could not be truer for male lions. When male lions are in the prime of their lives somewhere between 5 and 9 years of age they will attempt to have as many cubs as they can. And they will do their best to protect and guard over as many prides as possible.
Read more: Lions are still being farmed in South Africa for hunters and tourism – they shouldn't be
But there is a fine line between holding tenure over many different prides, and successfully being able to defend them and their young. When fights do breakout between male lions they are usually over territorial and breeding rights.
At times they are mere squabbles between coalition mates. At other times, the battles are big enough to cause rifts and splits within coalitions. But in most cases fights are between rival coalitions. During these fights lions engage in a suite of bodily and olfactory engagements including posturing, roaring and growling, swatting, and biting, and even urination and territorial demarcation.

For conservation: look to the lionesses
When it comes to the conservation of the lion species it is important to look to the lionesses. They are the sentinels of a populations health, specifically the number of animals in a group, and more importantly the ratio of lionesses to lions. Healthy populations can expect ratios of roughly 2 females for every male, but when under pressure due to poaching, killings by cattle farmers and a loss of prey these ratios invert towards males.
The story of Jesse highlights how, in spite of their status as king of the beasts, lions are vulnerable. While in this instance, the cause of death was another lion, much more commonly, lions die at the hands of humans. This can be through being shot or poisoned to protect livestock, being poached for their body parts or being caught as by-catch in traps and snares set for other animals by bushmeat poachers.
On the plus side, the fascinating pride dynamics and trials and tribulations of individual lions can help capture the public’s imagination and foster a love for the species and other wildlife. Although human pressures are high, Kenya retains a large lion population and a suite of iconic wildlife areas. These assets are a great source of pride for many Kenyans, and rightly so.","The fast, furious, and brutally short life of an African male lion",environment + energy
"The European Union has banned the use of several pesticides, and heavily restricted others. This is because of their potential health effects or environmental contamination, or because there’s not enough data to be sure that they aren’t harmful. Over 50% of these pesticides are still registered in Nigeria, however.
Nigeria’s use of such pesticides is the reason some markets, including the EU and the US, reject the country’s agricultural products. Yet some countries with strict regulations at home still export the banned pesticides to countries like Nigeria.
As a researcher in the field of food and agricultural law, international trade and natural resource development, I’ve explored the laws and regulations that govern the use of pesticides. My research highlights the gaps that undermine export opportunities.
I identified four major factors that make Nigeria’s pesticide regulations ineffective. They are: outdated laws; overlapping regulatory functions; resource limitations; and the influence of multinationals.
Good pesticide regulation should do three main things: protect people and the planet, support effective pest control, and provide redress when harm occurs.
Better regulation will make Nigeria’s agricultural products safer for local consumption and export.
Limiting factors
Outdated laws: Nigeria’s laws are outdated. The laws that regulate pesticides do not stop Nigerians from importing banned chemical products.
More than half of the products approved by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, the principal agency for pesticides control, contain harmful active ingredients banned by the European Union.
There are no provisions to hold manufacturers accountable for the negative impact of hazardous pesticides. No law requires people to use personal protective equipment when applying pesticides. And there’s no legal duty to monitor residue in food.
Overlapping regulatory functions: The agencies regulating pesticide use in Nigeria don’t work together. Some of their functions overlap and other functions are neglected. A national pesticide policy was announced in March 2019 to help coordinate what they do. But it hasn’t been put into practice.
The regulators and civil society organisations that are supposed to enforce rules and protect consumers don’t collaborate either. The regulatory agencies could get valuable insights and feedback from farmers’ associations, for example. This lack of cooperation makes it harder to develop and use robust regulations.
Resources and financial limitations: Agencies of government are unable to function effectively because of limited financial and human resources. For example, they may not have adequate machinery and laboratories to test products.
Influence of multinationals: Big multinational companies have a lot of power. For instance, the proposed bill to establish a pesticides council reserves two seats for an internationally affiliated association, CropLife Nigeria.
CropLife comprises private companies like Syngenta and Bayer that manufacture highly hazardous pesticides. Council members can make decisions and provide strategic direction. With CropLife as a council member, the regulated becomes part of the regulator. Instead, the council should consist of neutral and independent organisations from the scientific and academic communities.
Why effective regulation matters
In 2020, over 270 people died from pesticide poisoning of a community river in Benue State.
A recent survey by the Alliance for Action on Pesticide in Nigeria and Small-scale Women Farmers Organisation in Nigeria showed that 80% of the pesticides used most frequently by small-scale farmers were hazardous. Seventy-five percent of the women farmers in the survey reported symptoms from using pesticides. They include respiratory and eye problems, dizziness, vomiting and skin rashes.
Without strict regulation and enforcement, farmers might misuse or overuse pesticides in farms and storerooms. This would lead to environmental contamination and health hazards for farmers and consumers.
The average Nigerian consumer is unaware of the amount of pesticides in the food they consume. But Nigeria’s food exports are tested regularly, and pesticide residues far exceed maximum limits on some crops.
These regulatory lapses have blocked export opportunities. Since 2015, the European Union has banned agricultural products from Nigeria that contain pesticide residues. These include groundnut, palm oil, sesame seed and beans.
Weak regulations also make Nigeria vulnerable to becoming a dumping ground for internationally banned and counterfeit pesticides.
What needs to be done
Nigeria can learn from Tunisia, Mexico and Palestine. They have passed laws that prohibit pesticides that are banned in the countries that make or export them.
The legal community should engage in public interest litigation to hold manufacturing companies accountable for harm caused by pesticides.
The government should do more to inform farmers, pest control operators and extension officers. A community-based, hands-on safety programme will be more effective than formal training.
Food consumers also need to know about pesticide residues in food. The media should inform the public.
Lastly, alternatives to toxic pesticides exist and should be promoted as good ways to manage pests.
These steps will give Nigerian agricultural products a better chance of acceptance in the international market.

"Kenyan president William Ruto has lifted a six-year ban on logging, despite public objections. Ruto said it would create jobs and boost economic growth. Lisa E. Fuchs has studied the Mau Forest Complex, one of Kenya’s most important – and most threatened – forests. She unpacks the implications of this decision.
Why is the lifting of Kenya’s logging ban controversial?
A logging ban is a political instrument. Its effectiveness depends mainly on two things. First, who is included and who is not, and why and how these actors will be supported to re-orient themselves sustainably. Second, the political will to implement it according to its intention.
The same applies for lifting a logging ban. But it’s important to keep in mind that controversial political announcements and decisions target different audiences.
Kenya’s latest logging ban was introduced in 2018. This government directive was informed by shrinking water resources and came amid discussions to save Kenya’s water towers.
Deforestation in Kenya rose steeply from the early 1990s. According to estimates from the United Nations Environment Programme, the deforestation rate in Kenya was 5,000 hectares per year by 2010. This had several effects, including changes in biodiversity, river flows and the microclimate. They had an impact on agricultural production, hydropower generation and inland fish production. Human health and well-being were also affected.
Environmentalists have argued that lifting this latest ban risks reversing the gains made in recent years to improve Kenya’s tree cover. The country surpassed its 10% minimum tree cover target in June 2022. It now plans to raise tree cover to 30% by 2032 by planting 15 billion trees.
Trees and forests provide ecosystem services like air, climate and water regulation. These influence landscapes, livelihoods, economies and entire food systems.
Read more: How politics has subverted conservation efforts to protect Kenya’s Mau Forest
I have studied Kenya’s failure to “Save the Mau”. This was the tagline of a  large-scale campaign to rehabilitate the Mau Forest Complex in 2009. It involved multiple stakeholders, led by government and supported by civil society.
The Kenyan state has historically viewed and dealt with forests in terms of production and economic development, rather than biodiversity and conservation. Ruto, as minister for agriculture (2008-2010) and as deputy president (2013-2022), has repeatedly defended this stance.
How have previous logging bans in Kenya played out?
A similar ban – or rather, a three-month moratorium that was never officially lifted – existed between 1999 and 2011. In 1999, the country’s forests were in a bleak state. “Post box sawmillers” – companies that existed on paper but not in practice – were held responsible for much of the disaster, alongside the Forestry Department, which was in charge of registering and licensing them.
The moratorium nullified these sawmillers’ licences. It restricted them from legal logging, denying them access to public forests. What many people don’t know is that this ban was only partial. Kenya’s big timber producing companies (Timsales, Raiply, Comply and, intermittently, Pan-African Paper Mills) continued harvesting, processing and selling wood, timber and non-timber forest products without restriction.
These politically well-connected companies held a monopoly over the production and export of wood products.
In 1999, forest management was still regulated by the 1960 Forest Act. This law was widely held responsible for legal forest destruction by allowing the minister for forestry to convert the legal status of public forest land through a simple order published in the government Gazette.
However, even after the adoption of the landmark 2005 Forests Act and the formation of the Kenya Forest Service in 2007, the situation didn’t change as much as it should have. Existing regulations were poorly applied.
Corruption played a part in forest destruction by both big timber companies and small-scale saw millers. The Kenya Forest Service has repeatedly been named in this context in both academic and public inquiries, including a 2018 investigation.
What is the current political context?
The political climate in Kenya is heated.
Ruto has been under tremendous pressure since he took office in September 2022. The opposition has mobilised public protests over the cost of living. Sending a message about creating jobs can be read as an attempt to address people’s worries related to the economy.
At the same time, discussing forests can be interpreted as directly engaging opposition leader Raila Odinga, who led the “Save the Mau” campaign until its abrupt halt in 2010-11. Ruto and his allies played an important role in the halt.
During Kenya’s 2022 electoral campaign, Ruto promised change and economic empowerment through a bottom-up development model. Redistributing access to and benefits from the country’s forests might speak to many rural people and communities who are dependent on forest commodities – and to their political representatives. And having inherited a deeply indebted economy, Ruto has been looking for new avenues to generate revenue.
What’s the way forward?
Depoliticising environmental and forest conservation will help in seeking sustainable solutions. It will be particularly important to address the speculation over the lifting of the logging ban. The environment ministry recently said the ban had been lifted only in commercial forests.
During my research in the Eastern Mau Forest, it became evident that political changes – or even the fear of political changes which could result in a redistribution of access and user rights – led to what local residents described as a “cutting craze”.
Timber companies, small- and medium-sized sawmills, and even ordinary community members all took extremely short-term approaches to securing benefits from the forest and its resources.
Short-term vision has harmed the country and the environment in Kenya and globally.
Sustainable forest management (which includes both forest production and forest conservation) is not impossible or awfully complicated – at least when it’s not politicised. It mainly requires real political will.",Kenya’s logging ban has been lifted – it’s a political decision and a likely setback for conservation,environment + energy
"Record-breaking heatwaves are sweeping across the northern hemisphere, affecting large parts of southern Europe, the US and China. On July 24, Sicily recorded blistering temperatures of more than 47.5°C and wildfires are currently tearing through Greece. The heatwaves come as record numbers of fires continue to burn across Canada.
A study by the World Weather Attribution group found that these heatwaves would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change. In fact, the heatwave that is affecting parts of China was made 50 times more likely by global warming. This is exactly what climate scientists have been warning us about for decades – climate change makes many types of extreme weather event more likely, more intense and longer lasting.
As a PhD researcher examining extreme weather events and climate change communication, I have spent the past four years exploring how extreme weather events may affect the way the public feels, thinks and acts on climate change.
One area of interest to researchers is how extreme weather events might reduce the “psychological distance” associated with climate change. While climate change can feel abstract and vague, extreme weather is something people can experience firsthand.
But research offers contrasting results. Some studies have found that extreme weather events lead to an increased belief that human-driven climate change is occurring and greater support for climate action. Others find no effects or suggest that these effects are only temporary.
This summer’s heatwaves would have been virtually impossible without climate change. Giuseppe Lami
However, we often underestimate how much the public already cares about climate change. In Britain, just 4% of the public say they are not at all concerned about climate change, while only 11% of Americans dismiss the issue.
Given that most people are already concerned about climate change, an important question now is how to shift these existing concerns into action.
Talking about climate change is a powerful way of mobilising climate action, and extreme weather events provide helpful climate conversation starters. We can use these moments as opportunities to engage our families, friends and communities in discussions about how climate change may relate to these events and what we can do about it.
So, if you decide to engage people you know in discussions about extreme weather and climate change, here are a few thoughts and guidelines to keep in mind.
1. Listen and share perspectives
Extreme weather events can be traumatic and climate change can evoke a wide range of emotional responses. If the person you are talking to is comfortable discussing the topic, ask them about their experiences and observations.
Encourage them to tell stories and affirm the validity of their emotional response – whether they are afraid, angry, hopeful or worried. There is no one right way to feel about climate change, so listen to what they have to say and then share your own perspective too.
2. Talk about planning and preparation
When discussing extreme weather events, some people may link their experiences to climate change, while others focus on various local factors that contribute to extreme weather risks.
The risks associated with extreme weather arise from a combination of factors. These include the weather itself, which can be influenced by climate change, the level of exposure of people and places to extreme weather and the vulnerability of those to harm.
Climate change, for instance, can affect the frequency, intensity and duration of wildfires. But emergency responses, evacuation procedures, firefighting and healthcare systems are crucially important to reduce risks. There are also significant equity and justice implications of extreme weather as different populations are affected disproportionally.

It’s also important to bear in mind that while climate change affects many extreme weather events, it does not necessarily affect every instance. Weather systems are complex and there are meteorological processes that scientists are still trying to understand.
We also need to make sure the roles of local planning and preparation in minimising the impact of these events are not overlooked.
3. Challenge arguments about politicising the weather
In May 2023, Republican governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, dismissed concerns about global warming by claiming that he rejects the “politicisation of the weather”. Ontario premier, Doug Ford, recently made a similar argument about Canada’s wildfires.
In conversations, it’s possible that someone might accuse you too of “politicising” the weather. You can (respectfully) push back against this claim.
This argument is a discourse of climate delay. Rather than denying the existence of human-driven climate change, climate delay discourses try to shut down climate discussions and cast doubt on the need to act very quickly. These arguments disingenuously assert that acting on climate is too expensive, too late or that someone else should take care of it – and they are becoming increasingly common.
If we shouldn’t discuss climate change when extreme weather occurs, then when is the right time? If we want to protect lives, we need to talk about – and act upon – the risks associated with extreme weather events and the disasters they can cause.
If talking about climate change politicises the weather, so be it. The politics of climate denial and delay affected this summer’s weather, and our current decisions will shape our planet for thousands of years.

"Science fiction is rife with fanciful tales of deadly organisms emerging from the ice and wreaking havoc on unsuspecting human victims.
From shape-shifting aliens in Antarctica, to super-parasites emerging from a thawing woolly mammoth in Siberia, to exposed permafrost in Greenland causing a viral pandemic – the concept is marvellous plot fodder.
But just how far-fetched is it? Could pathogens that were once common on Earth – but frozen for millennia in glaciers, ice caps and permafrost – emerge from the melting ice to lay waste to modern ecosystems? The potential is, in fact, quite real.
Dangers lying in wait
In 2003, bacteria were revived from samples taken from the bottom of an ice core drilled into an ice cap on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The ice at that depth was more than 750,000 years old.
In 2014, a giant “zombie” Pithovirus sibericum virus was revived from 30,000-year-old Siberian permafrost.
And in 2016, an outbreak of anthrax (a disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis) in western Siberia was attributed to the rapid thawing of B. anthracis spores in permafrost. It killed thousands of reindeer and affected dozens of people.

More recently, scientists found remarkable genetic compatibility between viruses isolated from lake sediments in the high Arctic and potential living hosts.
Earth’s climate is warming at a spectacular rate, and up to four times faster in colder regions such as the Arctic. Estimates suggest we can expect four sextillion (4,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) microorganisms to be released from ice melt each year. This is about the same as the estimated number of stars in the universe.

However, despite the unfathomably large number of microorganisms being released from melting ice (including pathogens that can potentially infect modern species), no one has been able to estimate the risk this poses to modern ecosystems.
In a new study published today in the journal PLOS Computational Biology, we calculated the ecological risks posed by the release of unpredictable ancient viruses.
Our simulations show that 1% of simulated releases of just one dormant pathogen could cause major environmental damage and the widespread loss of host organisms around the world.

We then measured the impacts of this invading pathogen on the diversity of modern host bacteria in thousands of simulations, and compared these to simulations where no invasion occurred.
The invading pathogens often survived and evolved in the simulated modern world. About 3% of the time the pathogen became dominant in the new environment, in which case they were very likely to cause losses to modern host diversity.
In the worst- (but still entirely plausible) case scenario, the invasion reduced the size of its host community by 30% when compared to controls.
The risk from this small fraction of pathogens might seem small, but keep in mind these are the results of releasing just one particular pathogen in simulated environments. With the sheer number of ancient microbes being released in the real world, such outbreaks represent a substantial danger.

Extinction and disease
Our findings suggest this unpredictable threat which has so far been confined to science fiction could become a powerful driver of ecological change.
While we didn’t model the potential risk to humans, the fact that “time-travelling” pathogens could become established and severely degrade a host community is already worrisome.

We highlight yet another source of potential species extinction in the modern era – one which even our worst-case extinction models do not include. As a society, we need to understand the potential risks so we can prepare for them.
Notable viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, Ebola and HIV were likely transmitted to humans via contact with other animal hosts. So it is plausible that a once ice-bound virus could enter the human population via a zoonotic pathway.
While the likelihood of a pathogen emerging from melting ice and causing catastrophic extinctions is low, our results show this is no longer a fantasy for which we shouldn’t prepare.
They may only be microscopic – and far from the giant flesh-eating bugs you’ll see in sci-fi films – but the risks posed by pathogens shouldn’t be underestimated.

"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) joined the East African Community in 2022. This will offer the country, which has immense natural wealth, a huge market in neighbouring countries and direct access to new roads, railways and ports – and therefore potential global trade.
But as east African road and rail networks expand and transportation costs fall, the DRC’s eastern forests will become more vulnerable to surging demand by regional and global markets.
This could threaten one of the world’s richest biodiversity areas. The DRC’s eastern forests are one of the last remaining intact tracts of rainforest on the planet, second only to the Amazon. They help to regulate climate and provide resources – like food, medicines, materials and shelter – to millions of people. They’re also rich in minerals and forest products. Timber is highly coveted for its commercial value and, once roads are opened to harvest it, further encroachment and deforestation may follow.
Effective management and monitoring of timber harvesting and trade is therefore key to ensure the country’s laws are respected, a fair share of the benefits are captured, and illegal timber exports and tax fraud are reduced.
The country already has one of the highest annual deforestation rates on the planet. Since 2010, it has lost at least 500,000 hectares of forest every year, with peaks well above one million hectares per year. And while timber harvesting is not the largest contributor to the DRC’s deforestation rates – small-scale agriculture is – it remains a daily activity for thousands of operators serving the national and international markets.
In 2017 the DRC began to lay the legal groundwork to establish a series of “timber parks” at border crossings around the country, with an initial focus on the eastern borders. These would monitor timber exports and revenue collection.
Over a period of two and a half years, we worked with Congolese authorities and timber park officials to test the first timber park at a major eastern border, operational since August 2018. We wanted to determine how well the current system worked in assessing the volume of timber leaving the DRC’s eastern borders. We also wanted to know how it could be improved.
Together with the park team, we found that timber reached the border without proper paperwork (making it impossible to determine where it came from); that only part of the total volume was being correctly declared; and that the mis-declaration of tree species was common, leading to timber being improperly taxed or not taxed at all. In the process, both local communities and the government lose.
However we also found that the presence of the park, and the pressure put on traders, did improve things over time. Park personnel were also quick to adapt and adopt improved verification techniques, making illegal trade more difficult, if fully supported by their supervisors.
A long way to legal trade
We assessed a total of 341 timber operations. From Kisangani, on the bend of the Congo river, east-bound timber is trucked 700km overland to the border, usually in the form of sawn planks. These are unloaded and inspected at the timber park before continuing on towards markets in neighbouring countries, as well as Kenya and overseas.
We found that for every 100 cubic metres of timber declared on the official waybills, 157 cubic metres were actually transported – that is, 57 cubic metres were undeclared and unpaid for.
Timber parks, where the paperwork for loads of timber is inspected, can help stem the financial losses from illegal exports. Center for International Forestry Research - World Agroforestry
Of the 100 cubic metres listed on the waybills, only about half had proof of payment of the four major taxes owed to national, provincial and local governments for harvesting timber. This deprives local communities of much-needed financial resources.
Species mis-declaration was also common. For instance, about 20 of the same 100 cubic metres were declared as Mammea africana (local name bulungu), while observations by trained park staff, corroborated by laboratory analyses, indicated the wood belonged to the genus Afzelia, possibly A. bipindensis (commercial name doussié). This species carries the highest rate of taxation of all species and has recently been listed in Annex II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. It requires increased scrutiny because it may become threatened with extinction.
Lastly, about 60 of the 100 cubic metres left the country undeclared, meaning only 18% of duties were paid. These discrepancies amount to revenue losses broadly estimated at about US$310,000 which, if fully collected, would pay for the park’s annual running costs and still contribute to the state coffers.
It’s important to note that, for the purpose of our research, we focused only on a small percentage of total timber exports. Available estimates of total exports from the eastern DRC vary from 65,000 to 200,000 cubic metres annually – putting potential losses at millions of US dollars every year.
Timber parks could help
Timber parks can be an effective tool for the DRC to stem the flow of financial losses from illegal timber exports. They send a clear signal to illegal traders that the old way of bribing your way out of the country is no more, or much more difficult to use. Up-scaling to all major border crossings, however, is needed to deny truckers the choice of crossing at borders without timber parks.
Critically, the park model needs the support of central, provincial and local governments to contribute to better environmental policies. Our results indicate that about 93% of the timber sampled bore no trace of an authorised logging permit. A logging permit can indicate whether the origin of timber is legal and, more importantly, whether sustainability standards should be applied during harvesting operations in the forest. With no title available, timber parks can increase revenue collection by taxing an illegally produced commodity, but it remains close to impossible to know whether the forest is responsibly managed and whether the forestry sector is following a sustainable path. Support from and coordination with the governments of producing provinces is thus critical, because they are the ones in charge of verifying the legality and sustainability of forest operations.
Lastly, as the DRC increases its trading connections to partner countries in the East African Community and the world, it should not be left alone in the battle against illegal timber trade. Neighbours such as Uganda, or even Kenya further down the trade routes, should improve the way incoming timber is verified and recorded. After all, exporting and importing countries carry shared and proportional responsibilities towards environmental stewardship. And once the DRC’s forests are gone, it’s all of us who will pay the price.",Protecting Congo’s forests: new timber parks will help fight illegal logging,environment + energy
"Nigeria, like many other Sub-Saharan Africa countries, has a waste management problem. The Nigerian National Municipal Waste Management Policy (2020) gives no estimate but states that “Nigeria produces a large volume of solid waste out of which less than 20% is collected through a formal system”.
This is lower than the World Bank’s estimate of average waste collection for Sub-Saharan countries, which is 44 percent. It also contrasts with the European and North American collection rate – 90 percent of waste generated.
The problem is not only how much waste is collected but the lack of accurate data about how much waste is being generated in the first place. The Lagos State is a good example. Nigeria’s most populous city generated 10,000 tonnes of waste per day in 2005. And the Lagos State said in 2018 that the amount of waste generated then far “outweighs the official figure of 13,000 tons per day”.
Managing this waste, from collection and transportation to disposal, is a major challenge for Lagos, which accounts for a large proportion of Nigeria’s waste. The population of Lagos state, urbanisation, consumption patterns and the scale of economic activity work together to increase waste generation.
The Nigerian National Municipal Waste Management Policy (2020) has the potential to transform waste management around the country.
The policy proposes a system to separate, recycle and treat waste, conserve natural resources and create opportunities to earn a living from waste.
But the policy hasn’t been fully implemented.
In a recent article, my colleagues and I wrote about the need for Lagos State to put in place a strong policy framework that incorporates waste hierarchy guidelines. The waste hierarchy is the idea that the things we do to waste aren’t equally desirable. First should be prevention; then reuse, recycling, recovery and (least desirable) disposal.
The Waste Management Hierarchy. Author
We found that in Lagos, this hierarchy wasn’t being followed. Residents generate mixed waste without separation or sorting. Households store their waste primarily in plastic bags, sacks and buckets. Contracted waste collectors collect mixed waste and transport it directly to dumpsites. Waste pickers at dumpsites recover valuable materials and waste is burnt at these sites.
In practice, the waste hierarchy has been turned upside down in Lagos State. Waste is not being collected, transported, recovered and disposed of in a sustainable way – one that does not endanger the environment, human health and future generations.
How Lagos collects waste
The Lagos State Waste Management Authority was set up in 1991 to collect, transport and dispose of municipal and industrial waste.
In recent times, the authority has deployed street sweepers and improved open dumpsites. It introduced 102 waste collection trucks and the Adopt-A-Bin programme, under which households and businesses can buy their waste bins. It started the Lagos Recycle initiative using a smart waste collection and reporting software application, and has invested in equipment to manage dumpsites.
It launched the Blue Box Initiative, which aims to promote the culture of sorting waste at the point of generation. However, this initiative has crumbled.
Ongoing initiatives to raise social awareness about environmental issues include summer school for students and sanitation advocacy.
However, Lagos continues to produce a large quantity of waste without adequate mechanisms for managing it.
Weaknesses in waste management
The majority of Lagos residents are not aware of the environmental importance of waste separation and sorting. This should be the first step in a sustainable management system.
The prices of the individual waste bins provided by the Lagos waste authority, which is supposed to promote waste separation and sorting, are too high. For this reason, some residents (especially from low-income families) use plastic bags, sacks and buckets instead of bins.
Also contributing to poor waste management in Lagos State are:
irregular and sporadic collection
residents’ unwillingness to pay
the collapse of the materials recovery and recycling facility (Olusosun buy-back facility)
open burning at dumpsites, which endangers lives
dangerous conditions for street sweepers on roads and highways
inadequate funding
poor technology
weak policy framework
inadequate social development
inconsistencies in enforcement and monitoring.
Improving waste management in Lagos
The Lagos State Waste Management Authority needs to identify the most appropriate waste streams (multiple, single or dirty recycling) according to the income level of residents. The multiple recycling stream means that several bins are provided for the collection of different recyclable materials. A single recycling stream involves collecting all recyclable materials in a single bin. Dirty recycling streams put all waste in a single bin without sorting and separation.
The multiple stream is most suited to high-income areas and the dirty stream more practical for low-income areas.
The dirty recycling system is similar to the practices of cart pushers who collect unsorted waste from households in wheelbarrows. The difference is that residents can dispose of their waste in a bin of their choice for a fixed fee (pay-as-you-throw) in waste collection vehicles assigned to their area.
The Lagos State Waste Management Authority, policy makers, waste collectors, community representatives, residents and other relevant stakeholders decides which waste belongs in the 3-in-1 and 2-in-1 bins and sets the bin prices for the pay-as-you-throw system after proper consultation.
Street sweepers and waste pickers should become city employees. Sweepers should be replaced by sweeping trucks with appropriate training.
Dumpsites should be upgraded to landfills. Appropriate technologies and digital solutions should be adopted. And people should be made aware of waste separation and sorting through the school curriculum, social media, television, radio and billboards.
Equally important are prudent financial management, bin incentives and government financial aid for private individuals who want to get into waste management. The system also needs consistent enforcement and monitoring. Above all, this is a template that can be replicated in other parts of the Nigerian state.",Waste disposal in Nigeria is a mess: how Lagos can take the lead in sorting and recycling,environment + energy
"In South Africa an estimated 8,000 lions are bred and kept in captivity for commercial purposes in more than 350 facilities. This is far more than the country’s wild population, estimated at 3,500 individuals.
These big cats are exploited in a variety of different ways including interactive cub “petting” tourism, “canned” trophy hunting (where the lions are hunted in small enclosures with no chance of escape), live exports, and the supply of body parts for use in traditional medicine.
Despite ongoing controversy surrounding this industry – in particular related to reports of animal cruelty and risks to public health – the commercial captive breeding and canned hunting of lions in South Africa is still legal.
By contrast, the export of lion bones, claws, skulls, and teeth originating from lion farms is currently illegal. This follows a high court declaration in 2019 in which the lion bone export quota was declared unconstitutional. Subsequently, no official CITES export quotas for lion skeletons have been set.
We are wildlife researchers who have been focused on various aspects of South Africa’s commercial captive lion industry including its potential impacts, how it is being regulated, and what may be influencing consumer demand.
We also work with World Animal Protection, an animal protection organisation, that has released a new report on the industry, which we contributed to. The report adds credence to pre-existing concerns about how some of these types of facilities operate.
Specifically, that some are using legal activities – like captive breeding and canned hunting – to fuel (and potentially cover) their involvement in the illegal international big cat bone trade. Lion bones are sought after for use in traditional medicine.
This finding adds more weight to various reports about the illegal trade in lion bones over the years.
A nexus of legal and illegal trade
Many of South Africa’s captive lion facilities are open to the public who pay to see and have direct contact with the big cats. However, others are situated in remote locations and operate ‘off grid’. They are closed to the public.
As part of our ongoing research into this industry, in late 2022, we received disturbing intelligence from anonymous sources employed by some of these ‘off grid’ lion farms. This information formed the basis of the new World Animal Protection report.
When dealing with issues involving wildlife and illegality, researchers often rely on sources whose identity must be kept hidden for their own protection. Recent studies carried out in this way include those focused on the illegal killing, processing, and trade of jaguar parts in South America.
The South African sources told us about the involvement of captive lion facilities in the international big cat bone trade. Essentially, there’s a well-established and effective legal operation which is plugged into an illicit trade network.
Whereas after a canned trophy hunt the skin, paws, and skull of lions are prized trophies by hunters, the lion’s bones are coveted by illegal wildlife traffickers.
In some cases, entire carcasses are left intact and are packed into cardboard boxes ready for shipment and for Asian bone buyers to collect. The reason this is done is to certify authenticity (that it is a lion carcass) and ensure tracking devices have not been inserted into the bones.
Sources also described how these facilities use various tools and tactics, such as security cameras, patrols and messaging apps to avoid detection during inspections.
A way forward
The fact that the commercial captive lion bone trade in South Africa is juxtaposed within a network of dealers that operate both legally and illegally is nothing new. In fact, illegal and unethical activities associated with the industry were a contributing factor which led a team of relevant experts (including traditional leaders, lion farmers and scientists) to conclude in a report released in 2020 that it was “tarnishing the country’s reputation with political and economic risks”.
Consequently, the South African Government announced its intention, with cabinet’s approval, to immediately halt the “domestication and exploitation of lions, and to ultimately close all captive lion facilities in South Africa”. But nothing has changed so far. The captive breeding and canned hunting of lions has continued.
Moreover, in late 2022, a ministerial task team was asked to “develop and implement a voluntary exit strategy and pathways for captive lion facilities”. This raised serious questions about whether the government was wavering in its stated intention to shut down the commercial captive lion breeding.
But given the intertwined legal and illegal aspects of this industry, it is highly doubtful whether a voluntary phasing out of the industry will be enough to stop the commercial exploitation of lions in South Africa.
Instead, there should be a strategy which includes a mandatory time bound termination of the lion farming industry in its entirety.
In the interim, to help enforcement agencies manage and ensure facilities comply with the law during an effective phase out, the industry needs to be fully audited, with all facilities officially registered.
To help prevent legal trade being used as a cover for illegal trade, farms should be required to stop breeding more lions. In addition, proper plans must be put in place to prevent the stockpiling of lion bones.

"Mount Mabu in north central Mozambique supports the largest continuous block of rainforest in southern Africa.
The Mabu Forest was originally inhabited by hunters of the Manhawa ethnic group. Its name refers to “beekeeping” in the eManhawa language.
The area contains exceptional levels of biodiversity. But its extremely diverse wildlife was unknown to scientists until 2005. Since then biodiversity surveys have recorded more than 20 species new to science. These include several species of plants, a new species of bat, a new species of forest viper and two species of chameleons, as well as several new species of butterflies.
In a recent paper we set out our findings from the first dung beetle survey on Mount Mabu. Within 15 days of exploration, we collected over 4,000 specimens of dung beetles, classified into 30 species. Of these species, half are new to science, and several are new country records.
Our findings are exciting because we live in a world where the danger of losing species is more imminent than the chances of describing them. New discoveries provide vital ammunition in the battle against biodiversity loss.
The discovery of new dung beetle species should be seen as a call to national and international authorities to protect Mount Mabu and its rare and distinctive biodiversity, as it remains unprotected by law.
Onthophagus mabuensis, a new dung beetle species. Werner Strumpher.
Why dung beetles matter
There are over 7,000 dung beetle species worldwide. They are among the most dominant invertebrates in tropical forests and are essential to a well-functioning ecosystem.
Dung beetles feed mainly on the faeces of mammals. During the feeding process, they perform a series of ecological processes and environmental services. These include:
dung removal and nutrient recycling in ecosystems, which increases soil fertility
secondary seed dispersal
reduction of survival rates of nematodes and flies.
For example, manure is the breeding ground and incubator for horn flies and face flies, two economically important pests of cattle.
We surveyed dung beetles using pitfall traps. These consisted of a two-litre plastic bucket baited with mammal faeces. The traps were left in the field for 48 hours, and then the catch of each individual trap was labelled and stored separately in alcohol. The collected specimens were processed and identified in the laboratory at the National Museum in Bloemfontein, South Africa.
Dung beetles must be protected from extinction
Our research results increase the number of currently valid dung beetle species recorded from Mozambique to 326. We believe this is still way below the country’s actual diversity.
The research uncovered an unknown community of dung beetles; previous dung beetle surveys in the country were centred in southern Mozambique (especially its coastal areas) and Gorongosa National Park. In contrast, other areas of the country are poorly studied.
The author, standing by a sweep net during the expedition. Isildo Nganhane.:
Interestingly, the species composition of dung beetles from Mabu Forest suggests ancient linkages and evidence of a significant influence of dung beetle fauna from mountains to the north (Tanzania) and to the west (Malawi), the Eastern Arc Mountains, and Moreau’s Tanganyika–Nyasa Montane Chain, respectively.
Several dung beetle species collected in our expedition seem to be endemic (restricted to a certain location) to the region of Mabu. Endemic dung beetle species are key to their ecosystems and become a thermometer when it comes to measuring the state of a territory’s health. For that reason, their protection from extinction threats is critical.
Next steps
We are living in an era where land use, habitat fragmentation, global climate change, direct over-exploitation and co-extinction of species dependent on other species are all threats to biodiversity. Insects – including dung beetles – are declining globally. Thus, it is critical that biodiversity surveys are expanded to remote and unsampled areas, especially unprotected “sky-island forests”, such as Mount Mabu and others in northern Mozambique.
Our findings and others from previous surveys should be translated into biodiversity conservation policies to change people’s uncaring attitude to biodiversity loss and to avert a sixth mass extinction.",Dung beetles: expedition unearths new species on Mozambique’s Mount Mabu,environment + energy
"A man was arrested at the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 23 June 2023 with five lion carcasses in his luggage. He was about to board a flight to Vietnam, where the use of lion bones in traditional medicines is practised.
The seizure is commendable but highlights South Africa’s controversial legal industry of breeding lions in captivity. Wildlife researchers Neil D'Cruze and Jennah Green, who have studied lion farming in South Africa, share their insights into the industry and explain why it should be shut down.
Why are lions being farmed?
Lions have been intensively farmed for commercial purposes in South Africa since the 1990s.
These wild animals are exploited as entertainment attractions for tourists, like cub petting and “walk with lions” experiences. Others are used for “canned” trophy hunting, where the lion is hunted in an enclosed space, with no chance of escape.
They are also used for traditional medicine both in South Africa and internationally, where their body parts, particularly their bones, are exported to Asia. They’re used as ingredients in traditional Asian medicine, such as “wines” and tonics. These would usually contain tiger bone, but lion bones are being used as a substitute.
They’re also sold live.
What does the lion farming industry look like?
According to official records in 2019, around 8,000 lions are being held in over 350 facilities in South Africa. In contrast, the current wild population in the country is estimated to be about  3,500 lions.
Some farms also breed other big cats, including tigers, cheetahs, leopards, jaguars and hybrids.
The exact number of lions and other species on commercial “lion farms” across South Africa, however, is unknown. The industry has never been fully audited and not all farms are officially registered. In addition, corruption and a lack of proper record-keeping make it difficult for authorities to manage the industry and ensure facilities comply with the law.
How is the industry regulated?
A major problem is how the lion farming industry is being regulated in South Africa.
At a national level, governance of this industry has fallen under a patchwork of legislation including the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act and regulations around threatened or protected species. With national and provincial concurrence, the regulation of the industry falls to the provincial nature conservation authorities.
But, as there is no centralised national system, transparency and enforcement is difficult. This results in grey areas that cloud the legality of the industry and its associated activities, contributing to confusion and noncompliance throughout.
Likewise, at an international level, lion bone exports are regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). But the industry has been under scrutiny since 2019, when a high court in South Africa declared the lion bone export quota unconstitutional – due in large part to animal welfare concerns.
Consequently, since that time, the CITES export quota has been deferred, resulting in a “zero quota”. This means that lion skeletons cannot be legally exported for commercial purposes. And any subsequent exports originating from lion farms are illegal.
Why is this industry a problem?
Lion farming in South Africa is controversial.
The industry has been estimated by some to contribute up to R500 million (US$42 million) annually to the South African economy. However, in 2021 a high level report compiled by relevant experts (including traditional leaders, lion farmers and scientists) highlighted that the industry posed a risk to public health (because of the potential transmission of zoonotic disease and lion attacks), “does not contribute meaningfully to the conservation of wild lions”, and was tarnishing the country’s reputation with “political and economic risks”.
This led to the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment announcing its intention, which cabinet later adopted, to immediately halt the “domestication and exploitation of lions, and to ultimately close all captive lion facilities in South Africa”.
But nothing has changed. The captive breeding and canned hunting of lions has continued.
What should be done about the industry?
The minister’s public announcement of South Africa’s intention to stop lion farming was a defining development regarding this controversial industry and its future. However, in late 2022, a ministerial task team was asked to “develop and implement a voluntary exit strategy for captive lion facilities”. This was the first time the word “voluntary” had been used in public government communications on this issue. It raised serious questions about whether the government was wavering in its stated intention to end commercial captive lion breeding.
It is highly doubtful whether a voluntary phasing out alone can halt the commercial exploitation of lions and establish a process to close lion farms as recommended in the high level panel report. Instead, it should only be considered as an initial step. There should be a strategy which includes a mandatory time bound termination of the lion farming industry in its entirety.
Until then, to aid enforcement agencies and their efforts, lion farms should be required to stop breeding more lions and stop their canned hunting operations.",Lions are still being farmed in South Africa for hunters and tourism – they shouldn’t be,environment + energy
"Novels make worlds. They create an intuitive sense and mental image of a place. And the senses of space produced by fiction shape how readers see the world itself, just like maps do.
For early postcolonial literature, the world of the novel was often the nation. Postcolonial novels were usually set within national borders and concerned in some way with national questions. Sometimes the whole story of the novel was taken as an allegory of the nation, whether India or Tanzania. This was important for supporting anti-colonial nationalism, but could also be limiting – land-focused and inward-looking.
My new book Writing Ocean Worlds explores another kind of world of the novel: not the village or nation, but the Indian Ocean world.
The book describes a set of novels in which the Indian Ocean is at the centre of the story. It focuses on the novelists Amitav Ghosh, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Lindsey Collen and Joseph Conrad. Ghosh is a writer based between India and the US whose work includes historical fiction of the Indian Ocean; Gurnah is a novelist from Zanzibar, who was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize for Literature; Collen is an author and activist based in Mauritius; and Joseph Conrad, is a key figure of the English literary canon.

These four authors are notable for having centred the Indian Ocean world in the majority of their novels. Each also covers an important region of the Indian Ocean: Ghosh the eastern part, Gurnah the western part, Collen the islands and Conrad an imperial outsider’s view.
Their work reveals a world that is outward-looking – full of movement, border-crossing and south-south interconnection. They’re all very different – from colonially inclined (Conrad) to radically anti-capitalist (Collen), but together draw on and shape a wider sense of Indian Ocean space through themes, images, metaphors and language. This has the effect of remapping the world in the reader’s mind, as centred in the interconnected global south.

As the Kenyan novelist Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor has said, the narrative of particularly Africa’s interconnection with the world “seems to have been lost in our post-independence, postcolonial imagination”. As she says, “so much of Africa lies hidden in the sea”.
My book aims to tempt readers to dive into the fiction where it can be found.
The Indian Ocean connection
The Indian Ocean world is a term used to describe the very long-lasting connections among the coasts of east Africa, the Arab coasts, and South and East Asia. These connections were made possible by the geography of the Indian Ocean.
For much of history, travel by sea was much easier than by land, which meant that port cities very far apart were often more easily connected to each other than to much closer inland cities. Historical and archaeological evidence suggests that what we now call globalisation first appeared in the Indian Ocean. This is the interconnected oceanic world referenced and produced by the novels in my book.
The Indian Ocean novel in English is a small but substantial genre, including works also by MG Vassanji, Michael Ondaatje, Romesh Gunesekera, and many others.
Read more: Literature sheds light on the history and mystery of the Southern Ocean
For their part Ghosh, Gurnah, Collen and even Conrad reference a different set of histories and geographies than the ones most commonly found in fiction in English. Those are mostly centred in Europe or the US, assume a background of Christianity and whiteness, and mention places like Paris and New York.
The novels in the book highlight instead a largely Islamic space, feature characters of colour, and centralise the ports of Malindi, Mombasa, Aden, Java and Bombay.
To take one example, in Gurnah’s novel By the Sea, a teacher in Zanzibar is showing his young students their place in the world, and he draws a long continuous line around the east coast of Africa, up and around to India, and through the Malay and Indonesian archipelagos, all the way to China. This, he says, is where we are, circling Zanzibar and pointing eastwards and out to sea. Just outside the classroom:
crowds of sailing ships lie plank to plank in the harbour, the sea between them glistening with slicks of their waste … the streets thronged with Somalis or Suri Arabs or Sindhis, buying and selling and breaking into incomprehensible fights, and at night camping in the open spaces, singing cheerful songs and brewing tea…
It is a densely imagined, richly sensory image of a southern cosmopolitan culture which provides for an enlarged sense of place in the world.
Representing Africa
This remapping is particularly powerful for the representation of Africa. In the fiction, sailors and travellers are not all European. And Africa is not portrayed as a hydrophobic continent which only receives rather than sends out explorers. African as well as Indian and Arab characters are traders, nakhodas (dhow ship captains), runaways, villains, missionaries, activists.
This does not mean that Indian Ocean Africa is romanticised. Migration is often a matter of force; travel is portrayed as abandonment rather than adventure; freedoms are kept from women; and slavery is rife.
What it does mean is that the African part of the Indian Ocean world plays an active role in its long, rich history, and therefore in that of the wider world.","Four novelists, one ocean: how Indian Ocean literature can remap the world",environment + energy
"Each year antimicrobial resistance – the ability of microbes to survive agents designed to kill them – claims more lives than malaria and HIV/Aids combined. Africa bears the brunt of this development, which thrives on inequality and poverty. Nadine Dreyer asked Tom Nyirenda, a research scientist with over 27 years’ experience in infectious diseases, what health organisations on the continent are doing to fight this threat to medical progress.
What is antimicrobial resistance?
Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines (including antibiotics). This makes infections harder to treat and increases the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death.
In Africa, drug resistance is already a documented problem for HIV, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), typhoid, cholera, meningitis, gonorrhoea and dysentery.
How big a problem is antimicrobial resistance?
It is one of the top 10 global public health threats, and threatens to undermine years of medical progress.

Nearly 5 million deaths were associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019.
The African continent bears the heaviest burden.
The first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of antimicrobial resistance has estimated that in 2019 over 27 deaths per 100,000 were directly attributable to it in Africa. Over 114 deaths per 100,000 were associated with it.
In high-income countries, antimicrobial resistance led directly to 13 deaths per 100,000. It was associated with 56 deaths per 100,000 people.
The study showed that young children were particularly at risk. Half of the deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019 were among children under the age of 5.
How do inequality and poverty come into it?
In many African countries, poverty and inequality propel the likelihood of antimicrobial resistance.
Access to clean running water, proper sanitation and safe water management is a big challenge in many hospitals and clinics in African countries.
And there is often a dire shortage of health workers. Wards are often overcrowded. As a result, infections spread faster. Some of these infections are resistant to antibiotics.
Inappropriate use of antibiotics, inadequate health resources and limited access to the right medicines has also fuelled antibiotic resistance in sub-Saharan Africa.
Substandard and falsified medicines, due to their inferior doses, can allow bacteria to adapt, persist, develop and spread. Studies show that the African continent is affected by such medical products.
Global antibiotic shortages also encourage the use of inferior medicines.
With weak regulation, over-the-counter prescription of antibiotics is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The highest rates of over-the-counter antibiotics have been found in Eritrea (up to 89.2%), Ethiopia (up to 87.9%), Nigeria (up to 86.5%) and Tanzania (up to 92.3%). In Zambia up to 100% of pharmacies dispensed antibiotics without a prescription.
Is there any good news?
While tackling antimicrobial resistance on the African continent may be tougher than in other regions, many deaths are preventable.
There have been some encouraging moves to protect health systems and communities against antimicrobial resistance.
The African Union has established the African Union Framework for Antimicrobial Resistance Control. It aims to strengthen research; advocate for policies, laws and good governance; enhance awareness; and engage civil society organisations.
Fighting antimicrobial resistance involves developing new antibiotics and making sure they reach the people who need them. This is what organisations like the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership were created to do. We are seeing encouraging progress for an antibiotic against drug-resistant gonorrhoea, a high priority pathogen.
Six South African sites were involved in the clinical trial.
Measuring and monitoring antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use has an essential role. Here too there’s progress. The Mapping AMR and AMU Partnership consortium has recently published 14 new country reports on the situation across Africa.
The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership is funding clinical research for medical tools to detect, treat and prevent poverty-related infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. The vital field of neonatal sepsis is included.
It’s crucial to shift attitudes towards antibiotics so that they are used wisely. Organisations such as ReAct Africa and the South Centre have made good progress on this front.
They advocate for responsible use of antibiotics as well as ways to prevent and control bacterial infections.
In Kenya and other African countries, antimicrobial resistance champions raise awareness in schools, universities, clinics and communities.
A bold move by African countries to establish and expand local manufacturing of medical products requires strict regulation so that it does not fuel drug resistance with sub-standard or fake products.
What does the future hold?
The antimicrobial resistance challenges in African countries are huge. But momentum to counter it is building.
Crucial steps include:
greater investment
expansion of infection, prevention and control programmes, including good clinical prescription practices
improving access to essential antibiotics and diagnostic tools
the development of new antibiotics that can treat infections that are multi-drug resistant.

"The approval of two malaria vaccines – the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in 2021 and the R21/Matrix-MTM vaccine in 2023 – will help control, and eventually help eradicate, a disease that causes more than 600,000 deaths annually. Nearly 2 million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi have been vaccinated with the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine. It will be rolled out to more African countries from early next year. The second vaccine, R21/Matrix-MTM, approved by the World Health Organization in October, will be ready for rollout in mid-2024. Rose Leke, winner of the 2023 Virchow Prize for her lifetime achievement in strengthening global health and a prominent voice in vaccine protocols, sheds light on the breakthroughs.
Why are the vaccines significant for Africa?
There are about 40 million children born every year in malaria areas in Africa who would benefit from a vaccine.
The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine reduces malaria deaths by 30% and is especially important for children, who are most at risk from malaria. If you had 100 children who would die from severe malaria, you could save 30.
Mothers who have had their children vaccinated in the pilot phase have expressed appreciation for the vaccine because it has prevented their children from dying of severe malaria.
The second vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, is highly effective, reducing cases of malaria by 75%. Hundreds of millions of doses of this vaccine can be produced each year.
It will be ready for rollout as early as mid-2024
These two vaccines are new tools, but they have to be used with the other measures we have against malaria. These include bed nets and the administration of antimalarials to children at the highest risk of malaria at specific times throughout the year.
If we add the vaccine on top of these measures effectively, we may move further towards malaria elimination.
Read more: 'We could eradicate malaria by 2040' says expert after revolutionary vaccine is approved by WHO
How can all communities benefit?
There is great demand for malaria vaccines. The demand is estimated to be 40 to 60 million doses by 2026 alone.
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has given the nod to Benin, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda among 12 countries in Africa to receive the first doses of the vaccine. They will be allocated a total of 18 million vaccines for the period up to 2025.
Gavi is an international organisation created in 2000 to improve access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world’s poorest countries.
So as you can see demand has been far greater than supply. When we had just one vaccine, the RTS/S, quantities were limited, and the WHO had to develop an equitable framework for the distribution of the limited doses.
Countries were categorised. Those in category 1 were most in need and the first to be vaccinated.
I was a little bit worried about this. If somebody came to my country, and they were vaccinating in a category 1 village and 20km away, in a category 2 village, a child could not get the vaccine, that would cause a problem socially and even politically.
I was co-chair of the WHO panel looking into this. We spent a lot of time on the framework, trying to work out who gets it and who doesn’t.
These are the principles we followed:
Areas of greatest need: where the malaria disease burden in children is highest and the risk of death is highest.
Where the expected health impact is greatest: where most lives can be saved with the limited available doses.
Countries that committed to fairness in their vaccination programmes.
One of the criteria was that once the new vaccine was introduced through routine public health services in a certain area, continuous and sustainable access needed to be maintained.
Why is local manufacturing so important?
During COVID, we saw that Africa was at the back of the queue. The best way to secure supply is to make it yourself.
That’s why vaccine manufacturing in Africa is one of the Africa Centres for Disease Control’s biggest priorities.
I hope that in my lifetime I will see some of these vaccines being produced on the continent.
Not all people want the vaccinations, do they?
My experience in Africa is that routine immunisation coverage is still quite low. Now we’re going to add this new malaria vaccine. If we have low vaccination rates, we will never get the impact we want.
So we always have to encourage mothers to take the children for vaccinations, and vaccine hesitancy should really be stopped.
There’s the belief that these foreign vaccines are coming to kill the children. But what haven’t we imported? Is it milk? Is it soap? Is it sardines?
Why is it only with vaccines that people have these theories?
Vaccines have been so effective, the impact on the African continent has been so great.
Most of us, even me and you, might have been gone without vaccines. We need to inform people to get rid of this vaccine hesitancy that we have all over the continent.

"About half a million babies die each year as a result of pre-eclampsia, an aggressive and potentially life-threatening problem in pregnancy. Approximately 46,000 women also die each year due to the disorder.
The condition – a high blood pressure (hypertension) disorder – can affect multiple organs in the woman’s body, including the liver, kidneys, heart, brain and blood clotting system, as well as the growth and development of the foetus. If severe, and untreated, it can lead to the placenta detaching from the womb (placental abruption), seizures, stroke, maternal death and stillbirth.
Pre-eclampsia can be difficult to predict, and it can progress rapidly. The only treatment is delivery.
In a recent paper we found that planned early birth reduced the risk of stillbirth and improved most outcomes for mothers and babies. We concluded that clinicians can routinely deliver babies for mothers who have pre-eclampsia, from 34 weeks – even in a low resource setting.
We recommend that planned early delivery is implemented to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes in late preterm pre-eclampsia, particularly stillbirth. We argue that the intervention should form part of a concerted global effort to end all maternal and perinatal deaths from preventable causes.
When to deliver
Deciding when to offer birth requires careful balancing of risks and benefits. Early preterm delivery (before 34 weeks’ gestation) is only recommended if severe complications of pre-eclampsia have developed, where the benefit of delivery outweighs the risk of potential complications of early preterm birth for the baby (for example, breathing or feeding difficulties).
For the period between 34 and 37 weeks, there has not been enough research to guide women and clinicians as to whether it is better to routinely offer late preterm birth to all women with pre-eclampsia, or to watch and wait until either 37 weeks’ gestation is reached, or complications develop.
We set out to answer this question in a trial which we carried out in India and Zambia.
The Cradle-4 trial was a randomised controlled trial which compared planned delivery (initiating delivery within 48 hours of trial entry) to usual care (watching and waiting until 37 weeks, or the development of complications needing delivery). Women who agreed to participate were randomly allocated to either planned delivery, or to usual care. A total of 565 women with pre-eclampsia, between 34 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, without an immediate indication for delivery, took part. The trial was conducted across nine sites in India and Zambia.
The study found that planned delivery significantly reduced the risk of stillbirth – by 75%. In addition, planned delivery did not increase the risk of the baby needing to go to the neonatal unit. Neither did it increase the risk of short-term complications after birth, such as breathing or feeding difficulties. This is an especially important finding for clinicians working with limited neonatal resources, who can be reassured that planned early birth is safe.
Encouragingly, planned delivery reduced the risk of severely high blood pressure in the woman, compared to usual care. Rates of other complications such as eclampsia and placental abruption (where the placenta detaches from the womb) were also lower in the planned delivery group. Mothers who delivered early were as likely as those in the usual care group to achieve a vaginal birth, and spent less time in hospital.
Next steps
The current maternal mortality rate in the world is 223 per 100,000. The aim under the Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce that to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.
But this won’t happen unless there is a focus on interventions that address the major causes of maternal death in regions where they are most needed. These include sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, according to the World Health Organization. Our findings show that one such intervention should be to incorporate planned delivery from 34 weeks into routine care.
But this won’t be easy, particularly in low- and lower-middle income settings, due to over-stretched, under-staffed healthcare systems, where access to key resources may be variable.
To progress the idea, a number of steps need to be taken.
Firstly, early delivery should be incorporated into national and international guidelines across the globe. For this to happen there must an increased understanding around pre-eclampsia via community engagement. Women need to be better informed about what to look out for and what action to take, and need to be able to access healthcare facilities.
Community engagement is critical to translating research into impact and creating awareness about ways to alleviate this health issue.
This has already been initiated in some countries. For example, our research group has developed community engagement tools including docu-dramas designed alongside communities in Zimbabwe, Haiti and Sierra Leone.
A recent dynamic awareness campaign about pre-eclampsia was launched in Sierra Leone. It included creating competitions at universities to produce poems and videos about pre-eclampsia, putting stickers on taxis and motorbikes and putting up posters.
In Zambia, a national television broadcast encouraging women to attend antenatal care and recognise the danger signs of pre-eclampsia was shown on World Pre-eclampsia Day.
Secondly, planned delivery needs to be implemented alongside a range of interventions. Medical practitioners need to be enabled to provide early risk stratification, prediction of pre-eclampsia, safe labour and delivery care, and postnatal follow-up.
Thirdly, more research needs to be done in resource-stretched settings. Currently, only 2% of clinical trials take place in sub-Saharan African countries and even fewer address the most important causes of maternal mortality.
The Cradle-4 Trial acts as an important example of how this can be changed, and demonstrates the power of locally-driven evidence.",Early births – between 34 and 37 weeks – for moms with pre-eclampsia can reduce baby and mother deaths,health + medicine
"The BCG vaccine for TB has been used for 100 years. It is largely effective for children under five, but less so in older people and can’t be used on patients who have certain medical conditions. Today we’re the closest we’ve ever been to discovering a vaccine that might replace or complement it. Charles Shey Wiysonge, the World Health Organization’s Regional Adviser for Immunisation, discusses the latest developments in the fight against one of the world’s deadliest diseases.
Why has it taken so long?
We do not yet have a new vaccine for TB. But, for the first time, there are several vaccine candidates that are at advanced stages of clinical development.
Vaccine development usually takes decades and unfolds step by step. Experimental vaccine candidates are created in the laboratory and tested in animals before moving into progressively larger human clinical trials.
Clinical trials are research studies that test an intervention such as a vaccine in human beings and occur in phases, from phase 1 to phase 3. We say vaccines are in clinical development when they reach the clinical trial stage.
A phase 1 trial is a first-in-human study which recruits a small number of healthy people (usually fewer than 100), to assess whether a candidate vaccine is safe.
Phase 2 trials are typically conducted among several hundred participants, to assess whether the candidate vaccine produces an immune response.
For phase 3 trials, thousands of people are enrolled to assess whether the vaccine is efficacious and safe. Phase 3 TB vaccine trials are currently going on in Gabon, Kenya, Russia, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda.
Even though we are still, at best, three years away from broad regulatory approval of a new TB vaccine, the scientific community can do a lot now to prepare for its use, and to inform the public so that the vaccine may be accepted when it becomes available.
TB vaccines are very challenging to develop. The bacterium that causes the disease is complex, and is proficient at evading the human immune system. We don’t yet have a full understanding of how to appropriately target the bacterium or what kind of immune responses are needed to induce immunity. But there are some interesting approaches in the pipeline and there have been some encouraging data from clinical trials that are providing clues.
Why do we need a new TB vaccine?
TB is a global health emergency. About 2 billion people are currently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and of those, 5% to 10% may become ill with TB and will potentially transmit the bacterium.
In 2021, nearly 10.6 million people developed TB disease and 1.6 million died. We urgently need new tools to fight TB, including new and improved vaccines.
The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has saved tens of millions of lives and is effective in children under the age of five in preventing TB deaths and severe forms of the disease.
The vaccine has variable efficacy for protection against pulmonary TB (TB affecting the lungs) in adolescents and adults – and it is pulmonary TB that’s responsible for the majority of TB transmission. So new and improved vaccines that are effective in preventing pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults are essential to control TB, and to reduce transmission to all, including newborn babies.
TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV. People living with HIV have up to 20 times higher risk of developing TB disease compared to those without HIV infection. The current BCG vaccine is not recommended for use in people living with HIV, for safety reasons. Although BCG is a safe vaccine in immunocompetent infants (those whose immune systems are working properly), severe adverse events can occur in HIV-infected infants following vaccination with BCG.
These adverse events include a rare but life threatening condition known as disseminated BCG disease. However, new TB vaccine candidates are being developed and evaluated to offer clinical benefit in people living with HIV.
How effective has the BCG vaccine been?
BCG vaccines are given to more than 100 million children every year worldwide, at birth or soon after. The effectiveness of BCG can vary depending on several factors, including the prevalence of TB in a given area, the strain of the BCG vaccine used, and the age at which BCG was administered.
Several studies have shown that the effect of the BCG wanes as children approach adolescence. People may become infected with TB but not be aware of it.
What will happen to the BCG vaccine?
The BCG vaccine will not be replaced by another TB vaccine until and unless there is compelling data on the safety and efficacy of an alternative. Most of the current vaccines in advanced stages of clinical trials are tested in adolescents and adults. Their safety and efficacy would need to be proven in newborn infants to be able to replace BCG.
In addition, BCG vaccination has nonspecific beneficial effects on overall mortality and leads to more reductions in child mortality than would be expected by just protecting against tuberculosis. There is thus a great possibility that BCG would remain in use.
What will a new vaccine mean for the fight against TB?
This depends on what the clinical trial data for the new vaccine candidates show. Most importantly, any new vaccine will need to be safe, and it will need to offer clear clinical benefit to populations at risk. We hope that the TB vaccine candidates that are in the pipeline will be effective at reducing TB infection, TB disease and TB transmission and can become part of a combination of tools in the fight against TB.

"South Africans have a hard time figuring out which foods are unhealthy when they go shopping. But this is about to change.
South African supermarkets currently sell large amounts of unhealthy, ultra-processed foods. Packaged foods in particular have high levels of sugar, salt and saturated fat – all things that are bad for our health.
Research shows that the consumption of these foods is linked to increasing rates of obesity and related diseases such as diabetes.
Many countries have been looking for better labelling systems which help consumers understand whether a product is unhealthy. Countries that have adopted simpler labelling systems have seen consumers making healthier choices about food.
South Africa’s health minister published draft food labelling regulations in April. These will introduce a new labelling scheme, limit advertising of unhealthy foods, and restrict the use of misleading health claims.
The draft regulations propose clearer food labels, which include a new triangle highlighting that the food contains ingredients that are unhealthy. These logos will be placed on the front of a product.
We are part of the working group that advised the Department of Health on front-of-package nutrition labelling, drawing on our expertise in dietetics, nutrition, public health and the law.
We worked with consumers and experts on food labelling, advertising and obesity prevention to create a system designed to work well in South Africa.
But it was a complicated process. This is how we did it.
How do we know which food is unhealthy?
The first step is to find a way to identify unhealthy foods. There are international guidelines on how much sugar, salt and saturated fat people should be eating. These can be used to measure whether a food has too much of these ingredients.
Figuring out whether a food is unhealthy can be tricky, but luckily, other countries around the world have adopted systems like this before, known as nutrient profile models, and we could build on what they had already done.
We looked at what foods were being sold in South African supermarkets. We searched for nutrient profiling models that identify unhealthy foods and work well in other countries and tested these on the South African food supply.
We found that the Chilean model, which focuses only on unhealthy ingredients, sugar, sodium and saturated fat, would work well because it was simple to implement and was able to identify unhealthy products very easily and accurately.
We then modified the Chilean model to make it work for South Africa.
Choosing the right label
The next thing to decide was what kind of label South Africa should use. There are lots of different systems but not all work well.
One uses colour coding. For example, a low level of salt would get a green marker while high sugar would get a red one.
There are also descriptive labels which don’t tell consumers whether the amounts are good or bad – just whether they are present.
Then there are warning labels, often shaped like traffic signs, to alert consumers to the high levels of unhealthy ingredients such as saturated fat, sugar and salt.
We looked at how to design a label that would be understandable to the average South African. We consulted South Africans on each element of the label, from the wording and size to the symbols and colour.
We developed a black triangle – inspired by a danger warning sign – which would stand out on colourful food packages and included pictures so that anyone, even those who can’t read or speak English, would be able to understand them.
The last part of this work was a nationally representative randomised, control trial of different labelling systems. Almost 2,000 people across different income groups and education levels participated.
We also found that the warning labels led to consumers changing their minds about what food they would consider buying.
Earlier this year, South Africans had the opportunity to give comments on the regulations that will see this labelling system implemented. Now it’s up to the department to decide when and how to put these regulations into action.
Hopefully soon all South Africans will be able to see at a glance which foods are bad for their health.",Bad food choices: clearer labels aim to help South Africans pick healthier options,health + medicine
"Microbes such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi form part of our everyday lives – they live in us, on us and around us.
We need them for healthy digestion, immune function, and the synthesis of essential nutrients, and we depend on them for farming and industrial processes.
But microbes also cause disease in people, animals and plants. That is why science has developed an arsenal of antimicrobials that kill them or slow their spread.
Over time, microbes develop resistance to antimicrobials, and some eventually evolve into so-called “superbugs” that no longer respond to the drugs. So we see more and more untreatable infections appearing in hospitals and communities.
This phenomenon, known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), means that common illnesses and diseases may become life-threatening again.
Recent figures show that antimicrobial resistance has been linked to close to 5 million deaths annually – more than the total combined death toll of HIV/AIDS and malaria.
It is further estimated that deaths related to drug-resistance could increase to 10 million per year by 2050, overtaking cancer as a leading cause of death worldwide.
World AMR Awareness Week aims to improve awareness and understanding of this silent killer.
Remembering the poor
We need urgent global action to counter antimicrobial resistance. However, current efforts that focus on solutions developed in high-income settings may not be suited to the societal and economic challenges in low- and middle-income countries.
We are members of a multidisciplinary Global Convening Programme set up by The British Academy to look into solutions to this problem that are fair and inclusive. Our collective expertise includes epidemiology, ethics and human rights.
If we want people to become less dependent on antibiotics, we must address the factors that create dependency on antibiotics in the first place.
Antimicrobial resistance is a global issue, but there are some regional differences.
Most human deaths from antimicrobial resistance occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Drug resistance is a growing concern in malaria and tuberculosis in these regions.
Low-income environments often go hand in hand with the use of cheap antimicrobials that may be of poor quality or even falsified. These create the ideal conditions for resistance to emerge.
Many are sold over the counter for self-diagnosed ailments.
Antibiotics, animals and pandemic risk
Antibiotics are among the most widely used antimicrobials. Between 2000 and 2015 the use of antibiotics increased by 65% worldwide.
Globally, however, more antibiotics are used in animals and agriculture than for human health. Of all antimicrobials, 73% are used in animals raised for food.
In September 2016, the United Nations adopted a unanimous resolution recognising the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in animals as a leading cause of rising antimicrobial resistance.
Farmers rely on antibiotics to prevent disease outbreaks and boost production, especially where animals are kept in unhygienic and overcrowded conditions, and where farmers don’t have access to veterinary care. There antibiotics serve as “quick fixes”.
In one study in rural Uganda a woman told researchers she was using left-over antibiotics to treat family members and her chickens. This repurposing of antibiotics is seen as a way to survive and make a living.
Experts warn that antimicrobial resistance in farm animals, if unchecked, could lead to the next pandemic.
Everybody is exposed, everywhere
Environmental pollution in the form of antimicrobial residues spreads to soils, rivers, streams and oceans, as well as food and drinking water, and contributes to resistance. Everyone is exposed to antimicrobials, especially antibiotics, even if they don’t take these medicines themselves.
This kind of pollution is aggravated when antimicrobials are used and disposed of negligently.
The global response needs to be fair to all
We are calling for a new approach to antimicrobial resistance that prioritises equity and sustainability.
Policy options must be carefully considered with all those involved and by embedding public and community voices without having pre-determined solutions in mind.
“Simple” solutions may disadvantage communities that shoulder the heaviest burden of infections and poor healthcare. For example, banning the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics may help to curb excessive use, but it could also deny life-saving treatment for people who have no other options. Similarly, without antibiotics, small-scale pig and poultry farmers may no longer be able to make a living.
The solution we are working towards is fair and inclusive. It respects people and their traditions while also benefiting human health, animal welfare and the natural environment.",Antimicrobial resistance is a silent killer that leads to 5 million deaths a year.

"In today’s screen-filled world, many children and teens have nearly continuous access to media. Estimates from the United States suggest that school-age children spend four to six hours per day watching or using screens. Adolescents spend as much as nine hours a day on screens.
While media can open the door to learning and connections for children, it also carries the risk of exposure to violence.
News media in particular poses risks with stories of war, genocide, violent deaths, terrorism and suffering covered repeatedly in a 24-hour news cycle. Research shows that violence and crime receive disproportionate media coverage. And this is partially because we are drawn to these stories; negative news headlines have been found to receive more engagement and clicks than positive ones.
On the internet today children and teens have access to footage of armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, police violence, mass shootings and homicides. Violent news media in print, video or audio can be accessed any time and played over and over – along with commentary, analysis and framing that children may be susceptible to internalising.
As a trauma researcher and psychiatric nurse, I have studied the impact of trauma and vicarious trauma on children.
Violent news media and its framing on the internet cannot be ignored when it comes to children’s mental health. Even the most media-savvy parents cannot fully control the content their children consume or the framings they internalise. Nevertheless, in my view, there are steps that can be taken to mitigate the effects.
Amplifying the fear
Analysis of news media can be useful in understanding events in some cases. But anyone with access to the internet can have their say – from recognised experts to teenage social media influencers. They may amplify a child’s fear without context.
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, researchers coined the term “secondary terrorism” to describe the way that news media framing added to threat perception and distress.
As a result of exposure to violent media and accompanying framings, children may develop a distorted view of the world as a dangerous and hostile place. This, in turn, can lead to anxiety and hinder their ability to trust and engage with the world.
It can also impair children’s sense of safety and security, making it difficult for them to develop a sense of optimism.
Studies have found risk for desensitisation, fear, anxiety, sleep disturbance, aggression and traumatic stress symptoms among children linked to violent media exposure in its many forms.
How can parents react?
Parents have to balance two opposing priorities.
On the one hand, it is important to raise children who are informed citizens, cultivating age-appropriate skills to engage critically with events and injustices in the world. There is the devastating reality of school and other public mass shootings that pose real threats to children, as do armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in many parts of the world.
On the other hand, parents must monitor consumption of media to reduce exposure to violence and the internalisation of fear-based perspectives on events that hurt children’s psychological well-being.
Parents, grandparents, teachers and other adult leaders in communities can take steps to strike this delicate balance. They must offer a consistent source of safety and context in children’s media-filled lives.
First, it is important for adults to foster critical thinking about what children see and hear on the internet and in the media. Children and teens should be engaged in age-appropriate conversations about what they are witnessing and the context for violent events, especially when they are close to home. Open-ended conversations, exploration of feelings, and validation of children’s experiences of sadness, worry, anger or fear can promote thoughtful dialogue and psychological safety.
Second, adults must be vigilant about setting boundaries on media consumption and monitoring the content children are exposed to. Watching or listening to media together and creating space for discussion can offer children support for making sense of difficult news content and allow parents to monitor a child’s response.
Finally, adults should be news media role models for their children. Children frequently copy the behaviour of their parents and other adults. Our own media consumption habits, reactions and ability to balance online life with positive real-life activities speak volumes to children.
With the world’s violence in the hands of children and teens, it is adults’ responsibility to guide them towards a nuanced understanding of the world while also providing psychological safety.
It’s essential to foster critical thinking, set boundaries and model responsible media consumption.
These adult actions can empower the next generation to navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected world with empathy, emotional resilience and critical thinking.",Kids are exposed to violent war images: trauma expert sets out how you can protect them,health + medicine
"Recent advances in gene editing technology could potentially be used to create disease-resistant animals. This could curtail the spread of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu.
In a recent gene editing study, my colleagues and I showcased the potential of gene editing to protect chickens from the threat of bird flu. This disease is caused by an ever-evolving virus that gets around numerous biosecurity measures such as good hygiene, restricting bird movements, surveillance through appropriate testing, and selective elimination of infected birds.
A gene editing breakthrough would stem the huge economic losses currently suffered as a result of bird flu outbreaks. It would also be a significant step in controlling a disease that can cause serious sickness and death in humans.
Why managing bird flu matters
Outbreaks of bird flu around the world cost billions of dollars in losses. The United States Department of Agriculture reported that up to 50 million birds died from bird flu in 2022. Recently, the South African Poultry Association said more than 7 million chickens were destroyed after outbreaks were detected in the first half of 2023.
Beyond the economic implications, bird flu outbreaks also pose a risk to human health.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, bird flu was considered a possible trigger for a devastating human pandemic. This prompted international surveillance led by the World Organisation for Animal Health, the World Health Organization and the Food and  Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations.
The fear is well-founded as the three flu pandemics of the 20th century – including the 1918 flu pandemic that claimed tens of millions of lives – originated from birds.
Vaccinations can only do so much
Vaccination is a primary method for preventing bird flu outbreaks in chickens.
However, the effectiveness of vaccines is limited because the bird flu virus rapidly evolves. This makes existing vaccines less effective over time. Also, there are multiple strains of the bird flu virus but a vaccine is effective against a specific strain only.
It’s necessary to match a vaccine with the prevailing strain causing an outbreak. Using vaccines may also involve substantial costs and practical hurdles of distribution.
Gene editing to improve animal welfare
In contrast to vaccinations, gene editing targets a protein or proteins within chickens that are vital for all strains of bird flu, effectively stopping the virus in its tracks.
Gene editing refers to the process of making a precise change in a specific gene in an animal to introduce traits such as resistance to a particular disease, increased productivity and characteristics that enhance animal welfare.
A beneficial genetic change introduced into an animal using gene editing may already occur naturally in another animal.
For example, gene editing was used to make dairy cattle hornless by introducing into them a genetic change found in naturally hornless cattle. This is important as many dairy cattle have horns, resulting in the painful practice of dehorning calves to reduce the risk of injury to the animal and the farmer.
It’s important not to confuse gene editing with genetic modification, which entails transferring a gene from one species to another. This distinction is necessary for regulatory purposes, especially as the older genetic modification technology has faced stringent regulations in many countries, hampering its development.
To produce the gene-edited chickens in our study, we used the powerful molecular scissors known as CRISPR/Cas9 to make a single gene edit. We targeted the ANP32A protein in chickens.
Compared to normal chickens hatched simultaneously, these gene-edited chickens reached maturity without any discernible adverse consequences on their health and wellbeing.
To test their resistance, we exposed the gene-edited chickens to a low dose of the bird flu virus. Remarkably, 9 out of 10 of these birds displayed complete resistance, and no transmission occurred to other chickens.
Taking a more ambitious step, we inoculated the gene-edited chickens with a high, unnatural dose of the virus – 1,000 times the low dose. This time, 5 out of the 10 inoculated gene-edited chickens became infected.
We also found that the bird flu virus was capable of adapting to use the edited ANP32A protein, as well as two related proteins – ANP32B and ANP32E. But we demonstrated through experiments in cells that simultaneously editing all three proteins could completely suppress the virus.
What’s next?
Ongoing research aims to identify the specific combination of gene edits needed to create the next generation of gene-edited chickens, providing complete and permanent protection against bird flu.
Gene editing should be regarded as an essential tool for preventing and controlling deadly animal diseases.
Supportive government regulations will be required to promote the development of gene editing aimed at enhancing animal health and welfare.
The potential for disease resistant animals to protect global food security and public health is a compelling reason to pursue this innovative path in biotechnology.",Bird flu could be eradicated by editing the genes of chickens - our study shows how,health + medicine
"Women perform between three and seven times more caregiving tasks than men in the global south. These include household domestic work and largely focus on caring for children.
Hopefully this is changing. The 2023 State of the World’s Fathers Report, themed “Centering Care in a World in Crisis”, explored the experiences and involvement in caregiving among 12,000 men and women, many of whom are parents, across 17 countries. The survey looked at who does the caregiving, how they care, for whom, and what men and women think about care.
I am one of five co-authors of the report, which unveiled a remarkable appreciation for care among respondents. In an online survey they overwhelmingly associated care with positive terms. “Love” was the most frequently mentioned word across all countries.
Other frequently mentioned words included “help”, “protection”, “attention”, “responsibility”, “health”, “kindness” and “family”.
Most of the men involved in the survey said they were doing care work, and they were willing to do more. But many barriers stood in their way, including societal norms and financial constraints. While the findings of the research point to changes, it also found that the pace of change is far too slow.
Growing pressure for greater equality
Earlier this year, United Nations member states unanimously designated 29 October as the International Day of Care and Support. This reflects a growing recognition of the value of care and care work, highlighting the urgent need to distribute caregiving responsibilities more equitably.
Providing care for another person can be a positive experience, fostering empathy and meaningful relationships. However the unequal allocation of caregiving between men and women has long hindered women’s participation in paid work.
In 2018, the International Labour Oganization estimated 606 million working age women were not able to do so because of unpaid care work. And the heavy burden of care work has had adverse consequences on the physical and mental wellbeing of women.
Moving in the right direction
The State of the World’s Fathers report found that mothers still bore a greater share of responsibilities in care work such as cleaning, physical and emotional childcare, cooking and partner care. Women reported performing 1.32 times more physical childcare and 1.36 times more house cleaning than men across all countries surveyed for the report.
But fathers in countries as diverse as Argentina, Ireland, China, Croatia and Rwanda also reported dedicating significant hours to various unpaid caregiving tasks within the household.
The State of the World’s Fathers study attributed this shift to several factors, including the impact of COVID-19, evolving gender norms related to caregiving, and structural factors such as care systems and parental leave policies.
In 15 countries, between 70% and 90% of men agreed with the statement, “I feel as responsible for care work as my partner.”
Encouragingly, in some nations like South Africa (85%) and Rwanda (93%), men disagreed with the statement, “Boys should not be taught to sew, cook, clean, or take care of their siblings.”
Men who were more emotionally aware and open to seeking emotional support were two to eight times more likely to provide care to a family member than those who were not emotionally aware.
Men who spent more time caring for others experienced greater well-being. Respondents who expressed satisfaction with their involvement in raising their children were 1.5 times more likely to agree with the statement, “I am the person I always wanted to be” and report a sense of gratitude in life than respondents who did not report satisfaction with childrearing.
Everybody needs to chip in
It’s important to recognise that caregiving cannot be dependent solely on individual efforts. Men and women alike require the support of communities, care systems and policies to provide care effectively.
More than half of both mothers and fathers considered political activism for care leave policies a priority. This sentiment varied: 57% of fathers and 66% of mothers in India, and 92% of fathers and 94% of mothers in Rwanda supported this cause.
Women were more likely than men to prioritise care policies along with healthcare and gender equality policies. Concerns about the cost of living were prevalent among both genders, with slightly more women (58%) than men (53%) expressing this worry.
The study found a significant portion of individuals in all countries reported taking action to improve care policies. The majority (74%) discussed the issue with friends and family, while 39% of women and 36% of men signed or shared online petitions. Additionally, 27% of women and 33% of men attended events calling for improved care policies.
Policymakers have an important role to play in reforms for improved parental leave. Better data enables better policies, so there also need to be more accurate statistics on, for example, how many fathers take parental leave, and how time spent on care work is distributed among men and women.

"Death rates in South Africa have declined slightly during the past few years. But the country faces a steady rise in both death and disability caused by increases in non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer.
According to the NCD Alliance, a civil society network, non-communicable diseases cause 71% of deaths globally. Of these deaths 85% occur in low and middle income countries.
In South Africa, according to Statistics South Africa, there was an increase of 58% in deaths from non-communicable diseases from 1997 to 2018. Diabetes is the second leading cause of death in South Africa after tuberculosis.
Diabetes affects 12% of the adult population, wreaking massive damage to individuals’ health and livelihoods, and to the national fiscus. The direct cost of diabetes to South Africa’s health system is R2.7 billion (US$150 million) – and that is only for those patients who are diagnosed. It does not factor in the indirect costs of loss of jobs and income.
If all cases were diagnosed and treated, PRICELESS SA, a research unit based at the School of Public Health at the University of the Witwatersrand, estimates this would cost R21.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) a year, rising to R35 billion (US$1.9 billion) in real terms by 2030.
Finance minister Enoch Godongwana will table the medium-term budget policy statement this week. Based on our research and the experience elsewhere in the world, we believe Godongwana has an opportunity to improve both South Africa’s fiscal health and its public health in one swift, effective action: by increasing the Health Promotion Levy, better known as the “sugar tax” on beverages.
Why the urgency?
Most South Africans with diabetes are either diagnosed very late, by which time they are much sicker, or are not diagnosed at all. The SA Demographic Health Survey data from 2016, the most recent study, found that 67% of all men and women were “pre-diabetic” and suggested that a “large portion” of South Africans remained undiagnosed, and therefore untreated.
Untreated or badly controlled diabetes can result in amputations, kidney failure and blindness. Many of these same individuals also have high blood pressure and end up with stroke as a result of brain haemorrhage.
Obesity is known to be linked to diabetes – and rates of obesity and overweight people, too, are increasing relentlessly. Current rates of obesity in South Africa are 11% among men (with another 20.3% overweight), and 41% among women (with another 26.6% overweight). At this rate it is expected that 50% of South African women will be obese by 2030.
Both obesity and diabetes are known to be triggered by over-consumption of sugar. Liquid sugar is known to be particularly harmful and has no nutritional value. This is why the public health recommends at least a 20% tax on sugary beverages.
The Health Promotion Levy should also include 100% fruit juices in the list of products subject to the tax.
Sugar tax
In 2018, in an attempt to address South Africa’s obesity, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases, National Treasury imposed a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, known as the Health Promotion Levy. It equates to 2.1 cents per gram of sugar above a 4 gram threshold per 100 millilitres – which amounts to a levy of approximately 11% on the price.
As of June 2022, the sugar tax alone had raised more than R10 billion (US$750 million) in revenues that went directly to the treasury. Only R24 million (US$1.3 million) in 2019/2020 and R14 million (US$0.7 million) in 2020/2021 was allocated to expenditure on “health promotion”.
But the South African sugar industry fought the sugar tax from the outset. The tax started out at a lower rate than originally planned: it was designed to be 20% in line with World Health Organization recommendations, but was slashed to 11% because of sugar industry pressure during a prolonged public consultation period. The already ailing industry alleged it would cause further job losses.
In reality, other global sugar market realities are the cause of declines in local sugar production and jobs. For example distorted global prices are below South Africa’s cost of production. This predated the introduction of the sugar tax.
The South African government has not increased the sugar levy from its initial 11% in the five years since it started. It has put previously planned increases on hold. In the February 2023 budget speech the minister again imposed a two-year moratorium on the Health Promotion Levy, not even allowing for an inflation-related increase. In real terms, the sugar tax has effectively been reduced.
The South African Sugarcane Growers’ Association has expressed concern at the prospect of an increase in the levy, fearing negative impacts on the sugar industry. Yet research from PRICELESS, analysing data from the South African Quarterly Labour Force Survey from January 2008 to June 2019, shows that the sugar levy has had little effect on sugar-industry employment. Even at its current weaker-than-ideal rate, the tax has reduced consumers’ consumption of sugary beverages by about 2g per capita per day, separate research led by PRICELESS SA scientists shows.
Government could turn the tide
To reverse South Africa’s fatal diabetes trend and pour additional, much-needed billions into public funds, the government should increase the rate of the Health Promotion Levy to the 20% endorsed by the WHO.
Early detection and treatment is key to reducing the disabling effects of diabetes and the cost to the state. Therefore better diagnosis in the public health system should be prioritised – and funded from Health Promotion Levy revenues.
The fact that the Health Promotion Levy has already yielded more than R10 billion to the treasury is testament to its revenue potential. The win-win consequences of raising the levy seem indisputable.",Diabetes is South Africa’s second biggest killer disease: hiking the sugar tax would help,health + medicine
"Chad has reported its first dengue outbreak, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The country’s health ministry declared an outbreak on 15 August and so far 1,342 suspected cases have been reported, 41 of them confirmed in the laboratory. One death was reported among the patients with lab-confirmed cases. The outbreak started in Ouaddaï province in eastern Chad, currently the outbreak epicentre. Illnesses have also been reported in three other provinces. Godfred Akoto Boafo spoke to medical entomologist Eunice Anyango Owino about the disease.
What causes dengue fever and how does it affect people?
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by one of the four dengue virus serotypes. It is primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and to a lesser extent the Aedes albopictus mosquito, mainly in the tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world.
Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to that particular serotype, but not the others. That means that, after recovery, a person can still be infected by the other three serotypes. Serotypes are groups within a single species of microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, which share distinctive surface structures.
Most infections produce only mild flu-like illness; 80% of cases are asymptomatic. But getting infected with different serotypes one after the other puts a person at a greater risk of severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever. It is characterised by serious internal bleeding and organ damage, and a sudden drop in blood pressure that causes shock which can be fatal.
How widespread is it in the Sahel? Why is this first outbreak in Chad significant?
Dengue fever has been endemic in Sudan, with outbreaks documented in 2010, 2013, 2017 and 2019. Unfortunately, due to years of political and civil conflicts, the control and response capacity of the public health sector in Sudan has been limited.
The risk of spread in the Sahel region, which includes Niger, Mali and Chad, has always been high. This is because these countries all host the suitable mosquito vectors (Aedes). They also share the same tropical climate with seasonal heavy rains and floods.
To add to the problem, countries like Chad are grappling with a massive influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan who might be carrying the disease. The epicentre of the current outbreak, the province of Ouaddaï at the eastern border with Sudan, hosts more than 400,000 refugees.
The cities at the border with Sudan are densely populated and have poor sanitation. This provides a favourable environment for the vectors to breed.
In addition, Chad lacks effective disease control programmes. This is its first dengue outbreak. It doesn’t have the necessary public health preparedness and response capacities. So the risk posed by this outbreak is high.
The movement of the returning refugees has the potential to spread the outbreak in Chad and even across the border to other countries in the Sahel, the rest of Africa, and the world at large.
What treatment is available?
There’s currently no available treatment for dengue in the world. Timely detection and case management, especially treatment of dehydration and plasma leakage by oral or intravenous rehydration, are key in preventing severe illness and death.
There is an approved dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) for use in people aged 9-45 years. But for it to be effective they must have had one infection of dengue by any of the four serotype viruses, which must be confirmed by a laboratory test.
The vaccine is given in three doses within 12 months and protects against all the four dengue virus serotypes with an efficacy of 80%. However, its availability in developing countries in Africa isn’t assured, although it has been licensed by several national regulatory authorities.
Apart from the vaccine, the only other guard against dengue fever is prevention of mosquito bites and vector control.
What is the way forward in controlling the disease?
More investment should be put on expanding clinical and laboratory capabilities to deal with the disease. Given that this is Chad’s first outbreak, it needs to:
put in place standard operating procedures for clinical management of suspected and confirmed dengue cases
expand the capacity for early detection of cases – this could be done by procurement of rapid diagnostic tests and by alerting communities
strengthen disease surveillance and coordinate the response by actively finding cases. Cases within the community are likely to be underreported as dengue is unknown to the public. Also, clinicians might not be familiar with the disease presentation. It could be confused with other common fevers.
put in place effective vector control measures, like draining stagnant water around residential areas, cleaning and replenishing water storage containers on a weekly basis, distributing insecticide-treated nets, spraying indoors and using window and door screens.
strengthen surveillance to assess the vector breeding potential in containers and to monitor insecticide resistance. This is critical for selecting the most effective insecticides.
make communities aware of the risks of infection and how to protect themselves. Engaged communities can take ownership of the vector control strategy and adopt healthy behaviours.
strengthen cross-border collaboration. The current outbreak most likely spread from Sudan. The focus should be on prevention and vector control measures in border areas.
mobilise resources for a national contingency plan for dengue preparedness and response. And seek help from experienced organisations like the WHO.",Chad’s first dengue fever outbreak: what you should know,health + medicine
"There have been several important breakthroughs in medical science recently. Crispr, mRNA, next-generation cancer treatments and game-changing vaccines are some of them. Oyewale Tomori, a virologist with decades-long involvement in managing diseases in Nigeria, gives his verdict on the most significant discoveries and what they mean for Africa.
Are these extraordinary times for discoveries in medicine?
Yes indeed, the world is living through extraordinary times, but not every part of the world has the luxury of these groundbreaking discoveries in medicine. Time stands extraordinarily still for some people in the world, in terms of the application and translation of the accelerated discoveries for medicine.
Which two do you find the most exciting?
The two I find most exciting, among so many other discoveries, are the new mRNA vaccine technology and the two malaria vaccines.
The advancements made in the generation, purification and cellular delivery of RNA have enabled the development of RNA therapies across a broad array of applications. For example RNA therapy destroys tumour cells in cancer.
Messenger RNA (mRNA), as the name suggests, is a messenger protein molecule that has the ability to deliver a specific set of instructions to the cells of the body to make pieces of protein. Once the protein particles are made, they show up on the cell’s surface. The presence of the protein alerts your immune system to mount a defence and create antibodies to fight off what it thinks is a possible infection. The body learns to recognise the viral protein as an enemy.
For example, when the COVID-19 vaccine is injected into the body, the cells are instructed to generate the spike protein that is normally found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The protein that the body makes in response to the vaccine causes an immune response without a person ever having been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19.
Later, if the person is exposed to the virus, the immune system will recognise the virus and respond to it. The mRNA vaccines are safe and they neither alter the DNA nor cause COVID-19 infection.
Previous research laid the groundwork for the technology, which resulted in the development, production, approval and deployment of an effective COVID-19 vaccine in less than a year. The 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two scientists for “groundbreaking findings” on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
Since 2019, when COVID-19 was first reported, the disease has caused over 700 million cases and about 7 million deaths globally. The technology is cost-effective and relatively simple to manufacture and can be applied to the production of other vaccines, especially for the neglected diseases that are common in Africa. mRNA is a transformative technology for vaccine development to control infectious diseases.
The approval of two malaria vaccines, the RTS vaccine in 2021 and the R21 vaccine this year, though not accelerated discoveries such as vaccines for COVID-19, are a huge step in the right direction. This is particularly exciting for malaria endemic areas of the world. Malaria causes more than 600,000 deaths annually, the majority in children under five and pregnant women in Africa.
Although the malaria vaccines are no silver bullets, they are steps towards malaria eradication in Africa.
What do these breakthroughs mean for Africa?
The mRNA technology will serve as a template for the development of vaccines against long-standing diseases that are endemic in Africa, Lassa fever and other viral hemorrhagic diseases, as well as cholera, meningitis and others.
What do African countries need to do to ride the wave of breakthroughs?
Africa’s vulnerability to lack of access to vaccines was clearly exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This calls for greater vaccine-manufacturing capacity and capabilities across the African continent.
Yet, despite numerous declarations in support of vaccine manufacturing in Africa, the African vaccine-manufacturing industry is still nascent, with little progress made. The continent is manufacturing less than 1% of its required vaccine doses.
African countries must realise that investment in science, research and technology will produce significant returns.
Funding science and technology is a good economic bet. A recent Science|Business report suggests the long-term payback is in the order of 20% a year.
Africa’s poor public funding for research is well documented. In 2006, member countries of the African Union committed to spending 1% of their GDP on research and development. But by 2019, the continent’s funding was only 0.42%, in sharp contrast to the global average of 1.7%.
Africa has about 25% of the global burden of unrelenting endemic communicable diseases and a rapidly escalating incidence of non-communicable diseases.
Efforts should be channelled to find solutions to AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other neglected diseases including Ebola, Lassa fever and mpox.
African countries must reduce their dependence on donor funding for local research, but also stop pleading for the crumbs of equity for their health security, social well-being and orderly economic development.",Breakthroughs in medicine: top virologist on the two most important developments for Africa,health + medicine
"Over the past three decades researchers have explored various aspects of the impact of the HIV pandemic. One focus area has been children who have lost their parents to AIDS. Less attention has been given to children who are raised by parents living with HIV. This group has become much bigger as more people have access to antiretroviral therapy and are therefore expected to raise their children.
Our research in Zimbabwe looked at the effects the HIV status of parents had on their children’s education.
In Zimbabwe, the current HIV prevalence rate among adults is about 13%. In 1997 it was at its peak at 29.3%. Nevertheless, Zimbabwe still has the sixth highest HIV rate in the world. Eswatini has the highest rate (19.58%) and South Africa ranks fourth (14.75%).
Our research focused on mothers in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city, who had access to treatment. We were interested in the impact of HIV on their investment in their children’s education. We conducted interviews at Mashambanzou Care Trust, a local non-profit organisation that provides care to about 5,000 HIV-positive low-income individuals in Harare. Thirteen HIV-positive mothers were interviewed to discuss the key reasons behind the disruption of their children’s schooling .
We found that the HIV status of low-income parents in Zimbabwe severely affected their children’s education, in four ways.
Firstly, HIV worsened the financial barriers parents faced when trying to get their children educated. Secondly, children missed school because they needed to take care of sick parents or siblings. Thirdly, sick parents were not involved with their children’s academic achievement because they were physically, mentally and emotionally incapable of helping. Lastly, children of HIV-positive mothers did not always have birth certificates, a major barrier to school and exam registration in Zimbabwe.
Financial barriers
The research showed that HIV in Zimbabwe is not only a health issue but also a socioeconomic problem that can force people into poverty traps.
HIV-positive women expressed the view that the Zimbabwean economy, their partner’s health and their own health affected how they supported their children’s educational needs.
We found children with parents who could not afford to pay school fees or buy school uniforms could be sent home until the payments were made. Other low income families experienced this too but parents with HIV could not work and so had more difficulty paying school fees.
HIV-affected families could also face the burden of raising other children from deceased or ill family members. Some of the mothers had siblings and close family members who had died of AIDS. In one case, a single HIV-positive mother  had three biological children and three orphans from relatives.
Missing school
Girls were particularly affected because they were expected to care for siblings, help sick parents with daily activities such as eating and toileting, and make sure they had a place to live and food to eat.
Mothers spoke about the heavy burden their daughters had to carry.
My eldest child was the one who took care of me and cooked for me. When I got sick, my daughter stopped going to school. She is the one who took the responsibility of taking care of me.
Some children were forced to drop out of school to earn an income.
He dropped out of school after finishing his Form 3. He is currently selling bananas at Mbare and the money he is getting is not enough. Most of the time he brings home some food after selling bananas.
No time to help
Most HIV-positive mothers told us that they did not spend time with their children because they spent a lot of time on income-generating activities, attending to their own health, or their husband’s health. These tough conditions led to even more illness and stress.
All my seven children stay at home as none of them is in school right now. Each day of their lives is difficult as in some cases we fail to get some food to eat. After having failed to get food for the family, it then stresses me more as the mother. Given my condition that I am HIV-positive I end up getting continuous headaches and sometimes I get sick as a result of the stress.
Birth certificates
Some HIV-positive parents were too sick to obtain birth certificates for their children. Without birth certificates, children risk being sent home and cannot benefit from programmes that target poor children. One mother told of trying to get birth certificates for her children in Mutare, almost 300 kilometres away from Harare.
I once went to Mutare to secure birth certificates for my children. I was told to bring my national identification card which was in Harare during that time. I am yet to go back to Mutare and collect birth certificates for my children. I am only being stopped from travelling because I am currently sick and receiving treatment.
Looking to the future
Our research highlights a vulnerable group of children who should also benefit from social assistance programmes that target HIV-affected orphans, given that their parents are too sick to care for them.
They should be included in the National Orphan Care Policy, which seeks to provide basic care and protection to orphans and vulnerable children, and the Basic Education Assistance Module, which pays school fees for this group of children.",HIV-positive parents in Zimbabwe struggle to manage their children’s education – study shows how,health + medicine
"Echinococcus granulosus, a type of tapeworm, is a harmful parasite that affects 1 million people worldwide.
The parasite can grow slowly in people for years to form thick-walled cysts in vital organs, such as the liver and lungs. Known as cystic echinococcosis, or hydatid disease, it can cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. And if not treated, it can be fatal.
It’s a zoonotic disease, meaning it spreads from animals to people, with a life cycle involving humans, dogs and ruminant livestock. It’s also considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). It needs greater attention because of how dangerous it can be and because treatment can be invasive and expensive. It costs US$3 billion a year globally to treat cases and compensate for losses to the livestock industry.
In Kenya, the disease has long been endemic – meaning present over a long period of time at a relatively low level – in pastoralist communities who live and work closely with livestock, in north-western Kenya and Maasailand.
Traditional pastoralist livestock farming in Kenya’s north, for example in Turkana, has concentrated the risk of disease in communities there. But populations in other parts of Kenya are increasing, and thus so is the demand for meat. As a result, more animals are being driven south for slaughter, bringing tapeworm infections with them.
We’re part of a collaboration between the International Livestock Research Institute, Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology, the University of Liverpool and the Kenya Medical Research Institute. We’ve tracked the spread of Echinococcus tapeworm into populations in a non-endemic area for the first time. This work is important so that steps can be taken to prevent the spread of such diseases, particularly from animals to humans.
We conducted four pieces of research which covered how prevalent Echinococcus tapeworm was in livestock being brought for slaughter, how it spread to people and how great the human disease burden was.
We’ve found that the parasite is highly prevalent in livestock moving into these non-endemic areas and is now spreading, via dogs, into human populations.
Our findings highlight how important it is to carry out disease surveillance, particularly as populations grow and dynamics change.
Mapping the spread
Our studies focused on Busia and Bungoma counties, which border one another and which previously didn’t have the tapeworm disease, cystic echinococcosis, among humans and livestock.
For our first study we assessed how prevalent tapeworm was in livestock being brought for slaughter. Over two years, we collected over 16,000 reports in both counties and found a very high infection rate in the samples we collected – 32% of the livers of cattle and goats, 74% of lungs in cattle and 58% of lungs in goats.
Our second and third studies sought to understand how Echinococcus tapeworm might spread to humans in the counties. We hypothesised that local dogs could be acting as the vector.
Dogs congregate at slaughter facilities and consume whatever is discarded. For instance, we saw that often lungs from slaughtered animals were being discarded because of hydatid cysts. Dogs could get tapeworms from eating meat like this.
Dog eats Echinococcus cyst at slaughterhouse. ZED Group, Liverpool/ILRI.
We tracked the movements of 73 dogs using GPS collars over five days each and saw that they regularly visited slaughterhouses. Through examining their faecal samples, we saw that the parasite was present, and 16% were positive for Echinococcus antigens in faeces. This meant they could bring the disease to households and people.
The parasite matures in the dogs’ intestines, and the dog sheds eggs in faeces, contaminating the environment. People get infected when inadvertently parasite eggs from the environment are eaten, usually due to poor household hygiene.
Our final study was to examine how great the human disease burden was in Bungoma county. Using ultrasound technology, we found cystic lesions which may indicate Echinococcus infection among a small number (around 1%) of the community members.
While we did not find the population extensively suffered from this disease, we detected early signs of the establishment of a local transmission cycle. This means that the parasite has been introduced and is spreading slowly in groups of people and dogs which have not been exposed before. This slow-moving outbreak could soon represent a much more significant public health problem if left unchecked.
Unfortunately, very few people in the area can access the tools necessary to diagnose and treat the condition. Ultrasound imaging is the most effective way to screen for and monitor infections, allowing healthcare providers to offer people the necessary treatment. By the time human infections are advanced, expensive operative procedures to remove hydatid cysts are the only treatment available.
Routine ultrasound imaging over time also helps monitor treatment and surgical outcome. However, many health facilities lack ultrasound services.
A public health risk
The intersection of infected livestock from endemic tapeworm regions and dogs scavenging for disposed animal by-products creates conditions under which it is more likely that humans become infected.
As Africa’s agricultural systems face increasing demands from population growth and demographic changes, rapid unplanned growth can have devastating unintended consequences.
To protect populations, systems of surveillance must keep up with the changing world. Tracking the spread of disease, as we have done with Echinococcus granulosus in a non-endemic region, is an essential step to prevent future outbreaks of public health concern.

"Diabetes is on the rise globally. Since the 1980s the number of people living with the disease has quadrupled from 108 million to 537 million.
This dramatic increase is largely due to the rise in type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors such as being overweight or obese.
For many years, diabetes was considered a disease of affluence and thought to be rare in sub-Saharan Africa. This is no longer the case. Today 24 million people – one in 22 adults in the region – have diabetes and rates are rapidly increasing.
In Liberia, one of the poorest nations in sub-Saharan Africa, it is reported that an estimated 2.1% of its population of 5.2 million are living with diabetes. More than half of them are undiagnosed, underscoring the grave burden of diabetes in the country.
Available research on diabetes in Liberia excludes people’s voices and stories. It is not rooted in people’s lived experiences. As a result, the research findings seldom lead to change.
The goal of our study was to understand people’s lived experiences with diabetes in Liberia. We used a photovoice method, providing 10 Liberian adults with cameras to take photographs representing their lives. Through discussing the meaning of their photographs, we gained insights into local assets and needs.
Participants were recruited from Redemption Hospital in Monrovia. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we partnered with Adventist University of West Africa to help facilitate interviews.
Our study identified two major challenges: food insecurity and healthcare neglect.
Worrying about the next meal
Participants shared stories about worrying about obtaining food, compromising the quality of food they ate, skipping meals and experiencing hunger. They were often forced to choose between food and medication.
Not taking medication regularly for diabetes can lead to dangerous consequences like severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, coma and sometimes death.
One of the participants who was diagnosed with diabetes four years ago had diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes that leads to vision loss.
He had been unable to work since his diagnosis and relied entirely on his sisters for financial help and the kindness of friends in his community.
During periods of extreme financial hardship, the 30-year-old experienced hunger.
When I don’t have money, I don’t eat.
If people like him survive the short-term consequences of hunger, repeated experiences of hunger can also place people living with diabetes at risk for long-term consequences such as cognitive impairment.
Participants also reported concerns about the limited food options that healthcare providers recommended for their diet. They were generally advised to avoid staple foods with high glycemic indexes such as white rice and cassava dumboy that raise the blood sugar quickly and to replace them with foods like bulgur wheat and green plantain, as they provided better blood glucose control.
It was not always possible to adhere to these recommendations as foods like bulgur wheat and green plantain were far more expensive.

Liberia’s 14-year civil war coupled with the Ebola outbreak left a devastating impact on the country’s healthcare system.
As a result the country faces unique challenges in combating diabetes because of the country’s limited health infrastructure, which neglects people living with chronic illnesses.
In 2018, only about 22% of publicly funded healthcare facilities could provide diagnosis and management of diabetes. This makes it very difficult, for example, to get basic diabetes care such as testing, medication and diabetes education.
Participants on the research attested to this. One voiced his frustration with the local hospital and the lack of supplies and resources allocated to people living with diabetes. He was particularly disappointed that his local hospital was routinely out of medications:
Sometimes at the hospital, they don’t have all the medicine. Yeah, so the whole frustrating part is when you get there, and the medicine not there, you have to pay for your prescription. With the prescription, he can just write it for me, and I will try to get it, because I want to be treated. They give you prescription, then you go to the drug store.
Participants also shared how their religious faith helped them cope and sustain hope of living with diabetes. Their transcendent hope persisted despite hardship.
The way forward
Our findings demonstrate the need to improve the health and quality of life of people living with diabetes in Liberia.

Based on our findings, we recommended the following:
Increased prioritisation and resourcing of diabetes management. This would involve allocation of adequate resources for screening, diagnostic testing, medications, diabetes supplies and diabetes education.
Integrated diabetes centres to facilitate ongoing care. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no public or private diabetes centre in Liberia.

"The World Health Organization has approved a new vaccine that scientists argue will be a game-changer in the fight against malaria, which kills half a million people in Africa every year. Trials have shown that the R21/Matrix vaccine, developed by Oxford University together with the Serum Institute of India, reduces malaria by up to 75%. It can be manufactured cheaply and on a mass scale. The Conversation Weekly spoke to chief investigator Adrian Hill, who is also director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, about this revolutionary vaccine. Below are edited excerpts from the podcast.
Why is the R21/Matrix vaccine a game-changer?
We’re seeing about 75% efficacy by counting the reduction in numbers of malaria episodes over a year. The best vaccine prior to this was about 50% over a year, and lower than that over three years.
This is a material improvement, but that’s not the main improvement. The big difference is how you can manufacture it at a scale that is really needed to protect most of the children who need a malaria vaccine in Africa.
There are about 40 million children born every year in malaria areas in Africa who would benefit from a vaccine. Ours is a four-dose vaccine over 14 months, so you need about 160 million doses. We can achieve that.
The Serum Institute of India, our manufacturing and commercial partner, can produce hundreds of millions of doses of this vaccine each year, whereas the previous vaccine could be manufactured at a scale of six million doses a year from 2023 to 2026, according to Unicef reports.
The third real advantage of this vaccine is its cost. We were well aware that we couldn’t produce a US$100 vaccine. It wouldn’t fly for international agencies supporting the purchase and distribution of the vaccine in very low-income countries.
So where we are now is a price that’ll vary according to the scale, but at high volume it should be US$5 a dose.
Why has developing a malaria vaccine been so difficult?
People have been trying to make malaria vaccines for over 100 years. Well over 100 vaccines have gone into clinical trials in people. Very, very few have worked to any degree.
Malaria is not a virus, it’s not a bacterium. It’s a protozoan parasite, some thousands of times larger than a typical virus. A good measure of that is how many genes it has. Covid has 13, malaria has about 5,500. This is one of the reasons that malaria is super complex.
There are different parasite forms the first of which are injected by the mosquito into the skin and rapidly go to the liver. They spend a week multiplying there, and then they go into the bloodstream. And they are hugely different during these different stages. And the parasites grow at a rate of tenfold every 48 hours, multiplying furiously.
By the time they get to a really high parasite density, you will be very unwell. Or if you’re unlucky, you will die, typically from cerebral symptoms, a coma or from being severely anaemic. The parasites break open the red blood cells.
And then there’s yet another stage where the parasite changes again to a form that the mosquito can take up through its next bite and continue the life cycle by infecting somebody else.
So this is as complex as it gets with infectious pathogens.
Malaria typically goes through four life cycles and they’re all different. If you can get a really good vaccine for one of those, you will break the cycle of transmission. And that’s what we’ve been trying to do.
We’ve been working on targeting the so-called sporozoites, which is the form that the mosquito inoculates into your skin. We’re trying to trap it before it can get to the liver and carry on the life cycle.
Luckily, there are no symptoms of malaria at that stage. It’s a silent infection until it gets into the blood and starts multiplying inside your red blood cells.
So the sporozoite is a natural target to try and kill the parasite before it multiplies very quickly.
Tell us about past attempts to develop a malaria vaccine
Very early on people tried to use the whole microbe in the same way that vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner used the whole virus to inoculate against smallpox. Then the French microbiologist Louis Pasteur came along with bacterial vaccines, and so on. In about 1943, there was a trial of the whole malaria parasite vaccine candidate in New York with zero efficacy. That put people off for a while.
It wasn’t until the 1980s when we could actually begin to sequence the genes in the parasite that new vaccination candidates appeared. And then within 10 years we had 5,000 candidates because everyone hoped that the gene they had sequenced might be a malaria vaccine. And of course almost all of those failed.
Why aren’t vaccines for whole parasites effective against malaria?
It’s the same reason that just getting infected once by malaria doesn’t give you protection against the next infection.
In the areas of malaria where we test our vaccines in Africa, some children get up to eight episodes in three or four months. They get quite unwell with the first and three weeks later they’re having a second bout and so on. Natural immunity doesn’t work until you’ve had a lot of different infections and that’s why adults are generally protected against malaria and don’t become very unwell.
The people who die of malaria in an endemic area are the young children  who may never have been infected before and die with their first infection when they’re one year old, or they might have had one or two episodes, but that wasn’t enough to give them sterilising immunity.
Malaria has been around for tens of millions of years. Not just in humans, but in the species that we were before we became humans.
It’s a very wily parasite and has developed immune escape mechanisms  of all sorts.
When you try to vaccinate, you suddenly find there’s some way the parasite gets around that, and it’s only when you get up to really extraordinarily high levels of antibodies that the parasite hasn’t seen before and hasn’t learnt to evolve against that it becomes effective.
Will we ever eradicate malaria entirely?
Malaria is very high on the list of diseases we want to eradicate. I don’t think it’s going to happen in five years or 10 years, but it should happen in something like 15 years. So 2040 would be a reasonable target.
Nobody’s suggesting we stop doing what we’re doing at the moment with bed nets and spraying and drugs. But now we have a new tool that may be individually more protective than any of the tools we’re using at the moment.",‘We could eradicate malaria by 2040’ says expert after revolutionary vaccine is approved by WHO,health + medicine
"Ending the AIDS pandemic – particularly in eastern and southern Africa – cannot be achieved unless more resources are channelled to meet the needs of key vulnerable populations.
This is one of the themes that emerged during an AIDS conference in June in South Africa. Prejudice against particular groups – such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender communities – interferes with treatment regimes and people’s adherence to treatment. These groups are also at higher risk from HIV due to increased levels of stigma, discrimination, violence and criminalisation.
Our research is part of a three-year project on HIV-related stigma linked to young people with sexual or gender diversity. The research, conducted in Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia, involved 156 participants.
The research identified three main findings:
Criminal laws and strongly negative socio-cultural and religious beliefs produced deeply rooted intolerance around sexual or gender diversity.
Participants spoke about repeated experiences of verbal harassment, being gossiped about and physical violence.
Other population groups with HIV said their lives had become more tolerable as social awareness and acceptance of HIV had increased over time. However HIV-related stigma regained its potency when linked to sexual or gender diversity, with adverse effects for adherence to antiretroviral treatment.
Our research provided novel evidence on the deeply rooted fears and anxieties around multiple forms of stigma among young MSM and transgender women in southern Africa.
Criminalising sex
Across 13 countries in east and southern Africa, laws and policies criminalise same-sex sexual relations and facilitate the process of stigmatising gay and transgender individuals.
Recently, Uganda passed the Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2023, which punishes same-sex conduct with life imprisonment. Several acts considered as “aggravated homosexuality” are liable to the death penalty.
Our study also noted that young people had developed various strategies to manage their lives. For example choosing when to disclose or identify as a person living with HIV or as a member of the sexual minority community in others, but rarely being both at once.
The constant worry and stress of living with HIV, and the fear of being stigmatised, could have a significant impact on health and wellbeing.
The burden of concealing their identities resulted in a range of mental, emotional and physical vulnerabilities. Signs of depression as well as frequent alcohol use were evident.
Overall 42% of participants had contemplated suicide at least once. According to one participant, an 18-year-old:
I feel like I am nothing, I am useless. In the community, looking at HIV, I am a gay, people they isolate me. So, I don’t feel comfortable, even failing to go to work and finding some money, whatever. And, sometimes, I decide if I can die today, I can rest. So, a lot of things come into my mind when I am disturbed … Sometimes my parents try to comfort me but, internally, I am really disturbed.
As well as signs of depression, frequent alcohol use was evident.
There were few services available to assist in coping with these multiple stigmas, with those that came closest being provided by “sexual minority friendly” organisations or led by sexual minority peers themselves.
Fear of being found out
Being seen taking antiretroviral therapy or having it found in one’s possession signalled that one was living with HIV. Some individuals preferred to miss doses, occasionally or over more prolonged periods, rather than endure actual or feared stigma linked to being “found out” as someone living with HIV.
A 24-year-old told us:
What made me to delay taking medication is when my partner wants me to visit his home because he stays in Zomba, and I haven’t disclosed my HIV status to my partner yet, and I can’t take the ARVs with me there. As a result, I go there without the ARVs.
A 19-year-old said:
It affects me sometimes because, if people reject you, you feel like stopping to take the medication. ‘Maybe am just wasting my time, let me just die.’ It affects me a lot.
Other findings we made were that:
Many participants had had their status disclosed by LGBTIQ+ peers without their consent. HIV-related stigma is still highly prevalent within the LGBTIQ+ community and has many negative impacts.
Participants continued to experience or fear stigma related to their sexual orientation at health facilities, which also affected their access to healthcare and retention in care.
Tailored HIV services for key populations, including young MSM and transgender women, were not reaching everyone; rural areas were the least included.
Through their experiences, gay young men and transgender women were familiar with the harmful consequences of stigma and yet they were often ostracised from planning and decision-making roles.
The way forward
Key populations in our study faced inequalities in three main areas: access to HIV services; justice and human rights; and investments in programmes geared towards them.
There were few services available to assist in coping with these multiple stigmas. Those that came closest were provided by “sexual minority friendly” organisations or led by sexual minority peers themselves.
There need to be more community-based organisations that are run by members of these key populations. In Cameroon, for example, the CHAMP programme supports grassroots advocacy to mitigate stigma and violence and trains peers to offer counselling,

"It’s normal to have bacteria in your mouth. But harmful bacteria have been linked to a host of health problems. Medical scientist Glenda Davison and microbiologist Yvonne Prince, who have researched the oral cavity, explain why it’s so important to practise good oral hygiene.
Can poor oral hygiene lead to serious diseases? Why and how?
Abnormal bacterial communities in the oral cavity have been linked to liver disease, renal failure, cancers, heart disease and hypertension.
The oral cavity is the door to the gastrointestinal tract and the rest of the body.
Like the gut, the mouth is home to several diverse colonies of bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa. It’s the second largest microbial community in humans, after the gut.
More than 700 species of microorganisms reside in the mouth. New technologies, such as 16S rRNA analysis, have allowed researchers to study their genetic makeup and family trees.
These microbes are found all over the mouth: in and around the teeth, the gums, tongue, palate and saliva. They usually remain stable during our lifetime but if the balance in the bacterial community is disrupted, harmful bacteria may become dominant. This can lead to bleeding gums and oral diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis.
How do problems in the mouth lead to other illnesses?
Changes in the pH (acidity or alkalinity), temperature and oxygen in the oral cavity are known to lead to abnormal growth of groups of bacteria which are usually harmless. When they become dominant, they can cause disease.
This disruption in the oral biota causes inflammation and the slow development of periodontitis, bleeding gums and tooth decay. As the gum disease destroys the gum and begins to erode the bone, inflammatory molecules called cytokines can enter the blood stream.
These chemicals activate immune cells and can result in low grade chronic inflammation with the development of diseases such as type II diabetes, atherosclerosis or thickening of the arteries and many others, even obesity. The bacteria themselves can also move from the gums into the surrounding tissue and release toxins which can move throughout the body.
Similarly, the gut hosts more than 1,000 species of bacteria which reside in the large intestine and play a vital role in digestion, absorption, immunity and protection against toxins and harmful bacteria.
Human beings cannot live without a healthy, diverse gut biota. If this well-balanced community of microbes is disturbed and not restored, gastrointestinal disorders can be experienced.
Recent research has linked an abnormal gut biome to diseases as diverse as autoimmunity, obesity, cardiovascular disease and even Alzheimer’s.
Read more: Microbiome: certain gut microbes may warn of Alzheimer's disease long before the first symptoms begin
Where do bacteria in the body come from?
It all starts with our microbes, tiny organisms which share our bodies and are vital to the health of human beings. There are 39 trillion microbes in the human body, outnumbering the estimated 30 trillion human cells, and they inhabit almost every organ and crevice in the human body. They can be found in the gut, skin, lung, seminal and vaginal fluid, eyes, scalp and mouth.
Each of these habitats has its own environment, attracting different organisms which adapt to their surroundings and make it their home. They live in synergy with each other and the surrounding tissue. If this relationship is disrupted it can result in disease.
Most of these microbes come from our mothers and enter our bodies when we are born. The womb is sterile but as the baby moves down the birth canal and enters the outside world, bacteria and other microbes occupy the newborn infant and create a unique ecosystem called the human microbiome.
As we grow and begin to explore the world, these microorganisms become more diverse and varied and are influenced by our diets, lifestyles, interactions with animals and the environment. It is important to maintain this balance to reduce the risk of developing disease.
What should people do to avoid these risks?
Good dental hygiene includes regular dental check-ups, preventing the build-up of plaque by brushing your teeth regularly, and avoiding foods high in carbohydrates and sugar, which can lead to increased tooth decay and cavities.
To further support the balance of the bacteria in the mouth it is recommended that foods rich in antioxidants, such as fresh fruit and vegetables, are included in our diet.
Dentists also recommend avoiding the use of antibacterial mouth washes, which have been shown to disrupt the balance of microbes. Overuse can lead to disturbances and stimulate species of bacteria that could cause disease.
Elevated levels of stress and lack of exercise have also been linked to disruptions in the balance of the oral biota. So a well balanced diet with enough rest, accompanied by good dental hygiene, is recommended.
The mouth is the door to the gut and the rest of the body. Ensuring the harmony of the microbes that live there is important to reduce the risk of disease.","Brush your teeth! Bad oral hygiene linked to cancer, heart attacks and renal failure",health + medicine
"For any woman, pregnancy and giving birth are major life-changing experiences. Becoming a mother brings with it a range of emotions and, in many African cultures, positive emotions are centred when talking about motherhood.
Scholarship from the eastern, western and southern parts of the continent has emphasised how motherhood is linked to notions of continuity, strength and sacrifice, unconditional love, consecration and spirituality, family ties, loyalty and happiness.
In many African cultures, mothers are expected to be resilient, happy and tenacious. But what about the often “silenced” aspect of motherhood? Generally, mothers are not expected or encouraged to share any negative emotions about their experiences and role. Those who defy this expectation are frequently stigmatised and labelled “bad mothers”.
These responses often arise from the belief that motherhood is life’s key purpose. Seen through this societal lens, becoming a mother ought to be fulfilling and overwhelmingly positive.
But human emotions are complex. People can experience joy and sadness simultaneously. This is underscored by our study among HIV-positive mothers in South Africa about their experiences of motherhood. These young women, aged between 16 and 24, told us how they grappled with harsh realities and daily challenges.
They expressed regret about their unplanned experience of motherhood and wished their circumstances were different. It was clear they were experiencing conflicting internal emotions as they considered the roles, responsibilities and difficulties of motherhood.
Such negative emotions – especially regret – are seldom expressed when talking about motherhood. This leaves little room for African mothers to be vulnerable. To change this ideology and practice, safe space must be created for these feelings.
Doing so can promote open, honest and non-judgmental discussions that will lead to changes in the narratives surrounding motherhood, influence practices and boost emotional, mental and physical health. It can allow mothers and their children to thrive and be better equipped with the necessary skills to face life, irrespective of their challenges.
Motherhood is hard
We conducted one-on-one, in-depth interviews with ten HIV-positive mothers in Johannesburg, South Africa. The women all became mothers when they were adolescents. Their children’s ages ranged from two months to seven years old. We also interviewed three key stakeholders who, through their work as academics and researchers and in the healthcare field, engaged closely with adolescent mothers and HIV-positive individuals in South Africa.
None of the young mothers had planned to become pregnant. They were dealing with intersecting psychological, socioeconomic, health, cultural and physiological dynamics. They were stepping into new, unknown realities: as young mothers, some still had school responsibilities. Others were unemployed, as is the case for most adolescent girls and young women aged between 15 and 24 in South Africa. They depended financially on others such as their grandmothers, the government’s monthly child support grant, or transactional sex partners.
Their HIV status created another layer of complexity due to the attached health responsibilities, stigma and shame. Apart from the high susceptibility of adolescent girls to unplanned pregnancy and HIV infection in South Africa, another important reason for working with this group of mothers was to give voice to their experience and to possibly inform relevant policies.
No judgment
We created a safe, non-judgmental space in which the young women could share their feelings, both positive and negative. At least half of the participants told us that this was the first time they’d felt able to freely narrate their experiences, especially negative feelings about the experience of motherhood. Away from the pressure of cultural beliefs and expectations, they opened up.
The most prominent emotions they expressed were negative: specifically, they felt regret and anger. Their reflections were sometimes painful. One said:
I will always feel like I robbed myself of my childhood, and at times I will resent my child. I would hit my child so badly, and even though she couldn’t hear what I was saying but I will always tell her that I regret being with her.
Another told us:
I don’t know whether it was worth it, but I know maybe I could have prevented it … I wish I had known how difficult it was to actually be a mother.
This is a powerful negation of society’s notion that the moment a woman becomes a mother, she has access to knowledge and systems that enable her to maintain the image of “the good mother”. The notion that the fear and doubt will be pushed aside and only positive emotions will dominate is simply false.
Most of the mothers also shared the joy and rewarding feelings of having their children. One stated that:
… at first I was scared, but now I am happy because I look at her and she inspires me a lot … now I am seeing life in another way … with the support of my aunt and friends, I feel better.
Another said:
… it is good to see my baby laughing, happy, playing, very nice … like it is very (long pause) … it is beautiful … I like him smiling cos I’m like I can no longer imagine my life without my son (laughs).
Freedom and support
It’s time to shift the conversation from conventional and rigid constructions of motherhood to a more open, inclusive picture across Africa.
This will do more than just give mothers the freedom to express the full range of their emotions about motherhood: it can also contribute to more inclusive, tailored policies and programmes that take into account the many complexities and dilemmas our participants spoke about.
These might include access to need-specific, supportive, non-judgmental counsellors and therapists, and increased peer mentorship programmes, as well as access to sexual and reproductive health information and career support programmes.","‘Motherhood is hard’: young, HIV-positive mums in South Africa open up about regret and anger",education
"Around the world, men are more likely to get TB and to die from it than women.
We recently conducted research to establish the various factors that explain higher rates of TB among men in South Africa. South Africa is ranked among the top six countries contributing to 60% of the global burden of TB.
Our main finding was that men are 70% more likely to develop TB and die from the disease, compared to women. We estimated that in 2019, 801 per 100,000 adult men developed TB while among women the rate was 478 per 100,000.
Current TB interventions focus on biomedical approaches emphasising preventive TB medication, diagnosing TB patients and treating them with anti-TB drugs.
Our research demonstrates, however, that dealing with socioeconomic conditions and other determinants of TB is also important.
Men’s access to health facilities needs to be improved and there needs to be more effort to encourage men to seek medical care.
Our maths model
We used our Thembisa TB model, recently developed at the Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research at the University of Cape Town.
This mathematical model simulates the South African adult TB epidemic over time.
Because HIV is the most significant risk factor for TB and the primary driver of the epidemic, the TB model is combined with an existing Thembisa HIV model.
Approximately 60% of individuals with active TB are also living with HIV.
The model showed that between 1990 and 2019, South African men developed TB and died at consistently higher rates than women.
We estimated that in 2019 there were 1.6 times more new TB cases and 1.7 times more TB deaths in men than in women.
Our results are all the more startling because HIV is more prevalent in women than men. The expectation would then be that women should have a higher TB incidence.
Some of the risks
Other factors contributing to the high TB epidemic among men included excessive alcohol use, smoking, diabetes and undernutrition.
We estimated that of the 801 per 100,000 adult men who developed TB in 2019, 51% were attributable to heavy alcohol use, 30% to smoking, and 16% to undernutrition.
The numbers for women were much lower. Of the 478 per 100,000 adult women who developed TB in 2019, 30% were attributable to heavy alcohol use, 15% to smoking, and 11% to undernutrition.
Low testing rates
We showed that lower testing rates and delays in starting TB treatment among men contributed to 7% higher mortality.
Previous research has found that men are more likely to have jobs and it was more difficult to take time off to go to the clinic or secure treatments as it would affect their earnings.
Men were also often older and sicker when they sought health care and were more likely to stop treatment.
Our analysis showed that women benefited more from accessing HIV healthcare services, including HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy initiation. This significantly reduced TB incidence and mortality.
We estimated that in 2019, mainly due to treatment for HIV, TB cases dropped by 38% in women. There was also a 52% reduction in deaths.
In contrast, TB cases among men dropped by 18% and there was a 29% reduction in deaths.
Next steps
The higher tuberculosis incidence and mortality in men highlights the need to make health services more accessible to men and address the structural barriers to their retention in tuberculosis and HIV care. Mobile clinics could be circulated at places of work to provide testing for TB, HIV and other potential co-morbidities.
Additionally, there is a need for effective socioeconomic interventions.
A review of studies conducted across the world has shown that anti-smoking programmes driven by health practitioners and family members have achieved success rates of up to 82%.
Self-help programmes to stop excessive alcohol consumption need to be complemented by structural interventions such as increased alcohol taxation and stricter enforcement of the laws restricting the sale of alcohol.
A recent trial conducted in India showed that providing households with food baskets to improve nutrition could reduce TB by 50%.
Although biomedical approaches have led to declines in the TB epidemic, South Africa still remains classified as a high TB burden country.
Medical treatment needs to be complemented with measures to tackle socioeconomic conditions. Only then will we make real progress in reducing the TB epidemic in South Africa.",South African men are much more likely to die from TB than women – here’s why,health + medicine
"Something unusual seems to be happening with dengue, a potentially fatal mosquito-borne viral disease found across swathes of tropical Africa, Asia and the Americas. As with most infectious diseases, the number of cases tends to rise and fall over the years as epidemics come and go, but recently changes seem to be afoot in how dengue is behaving.
Not only is the number of new infections steadily rising around the world, but outbreaks are becoming larger and less predictable. For example, 2019 saw the greatest number of dengue fever cases ever recorded – almost twice as high as the previous year. And in July 2023, there were a record number of deaths from the disease in Bangladesh.
Most people infected with dengue will suffer from flu-like symptoms, ranging from relatively mild to very unpleasant, with fever, headache and joint pain.
In more severe cases, though, blood vessels can become damaged by the virus, allowing blood to leak into the surrounding tissues. This condition, known as dengue haemorrhagic fever, can produce bruising, and bleeding from the nose and gums. It can ultimately lead to organ failure and death as the body slips into shock.
The principal agent, or vector, in the transmission of dengue, is the Asian Tiger mosquito Aedes aegypti, although its cousin Aedes albopictus is also capable of spreading the virus.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main spreaders of dengue. Tacio Philip Sansonovski/Shutterstock
While Aedes aegypti is essentially a tropical mosquito, it is a very adaptable insect. In recent years, it has expanded its range out of the tropics into southern Europe and to several states in the US, including Florida, Hawaii, Texas and Arizona.
All mosquitos need water to breed, but another thing that has helped in its migration is its ability to use even the smallest of water containers to do so, something as small as a discarded plastic bottle cap will do.
Despite this capability, it is usually the lack of breeding sites that caps the number of mosquitoes in circulation and therefore their ability to spread the dengue virus. But in Bangladesh this year the rains arrived early and, coupled with an unusually high temperature and humidity, this led mosquito numbers to surge.
Because a large proportion of the population of Bangladesh spends a great deal of time outside and tends to have houses that are relatively simple for mosquitoes to enter, it took little time at all for dengue to take hold and then explode.
The demand for protective mosquito nets has surged dramatically in Bangladesh. Singularly Stock Photo
Although no one is certain about what’s driving the increase and instability of dengue, climate change may be contributing as much of the world is getting both warmer and wetter.
Fortunately for most high-income countries, even areas within the current range of Aedes Aegypti, climate change will probably not lead to any major outbreaks simply because people spend so much of their time indoors and out of the reach of mosquitos. It takes a certain amount of biting pressure within a population to sustain transmission.
WHO warns of dengue spread to new places
However, a new report by the World Health Organization’s chief scientist suggests that the disease may still be able to establish itself in parts of Europe, the US and Africa where it has previously been absent.
Something that is also likely to be seen more often is what happened recently in Bangladesh repeats itself across similar middle- and low-income countries where the opportunity for mosquitoes and people to mix is greater.
The solution is likely to be an affordable and effective vaccine. Indeed, the WHO has recently recommended the Qdenga vaccine for children living in areas where the infection is a major public health problem.
However, dengue is not the only concern as there are a variety of other mosquito-borne infections that kill around a million people every year. Diseases like chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika virus are all transmitted by Aedes aegypti.
An increasingly warmer, wetter and less reliable climate is therefore probably going to be the precursor for many more – and less predictable – mosquito-related disease outbreaks, and ultimately deaths, in the future. As with most other life-threatening communicable diseases, it is once again the poorest communities in the global tropics that will have to bear the brunt of this.",Dengue: why is this sometimes fatal disease increasing around the world?,health + medicine
"Antimicrobial resistance – the ability of microorganisms to resist drugs that have been developed to control them – is a severe problem in African countries. The continent has the highest global burden of antimicrobial-resistant infections, with 114.8 deaths per 100,000 people.
One of the causes of resistance is inappropriate use of antibiotics. Using the wrong antibiotic to treat an infection enables resistant bacteria to flourish and spread. It’s challenging to address the resistance problem when there are gaps in three areas:
access to effective antimicrobial agents
laboratory capacity to identify the source of infections
funding to carry out planned solutions.
It’s essential to identify the type of infection present so that the right antimicrobial agent can be selected. Treatment guidelines stress the importance of using laboratory data to guide treatment. Physicians need laboratory data to choose the right antibiotic, at the right dose, for the right period of time. This is known as antimicrobial stewardship.
But in low- and middle-income countries, hospital budgets don’t include much funding for laboratories. So laboratory data to create local treatment guidelines for doctors are scarce. Treatment choices become “empiric” – the doctor’s best guess based on the patient’s signs and symptoms and the doctor’s experience. This can lead to choosing ineffective antibiotics, which can lead to increases in resistant bacteria.
Our combined experience in understanding and addressing the spread of antimicrobial resistant organisms in African countries, and Nigeria in particular, spans 40 years. Over this time, we have noted how the lack of laboratory data hinders the effective treatment of patients with infections. We have also observed that the cost of producing quality laboratory data is high and rising.
Read more: Health system inequalities in East Africa drive antimicrobial resistance
One way forward is to pool laboratory data from other hospitals in the region to guide therapeutic choices. In other words, to develop a list of what bacteria are prevalent in the region and which drugs work against them.
To accomplish this, we recently conducted a study of multidrug-resistant bacteria obtained from patients in six hospitals in northern Nigeria. Our goal was to determine which antimicrobial agents might still be effective therapies in this region.
The results indicate that the mechanisms by which bacteria have become resistant in the region are complex. But there may be ways to support antimicrobial stewardship efforts in local hospitals.
Drug-resistant bacteria in Nigeria
We chose to analyse bacteria that are resistant to more than one drug because they are the biggest challenge when treating infections. We focused primarily on bacteria from blood and urinary tract infections.
We found that about 85% of the bacteria isolated from infections were resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics. So, without laboratory data, the most frequent choices of antibiotics would probably be ineffective.
In addition, 65% of the bacteria analysed were resistant to the “antibiotics of last resort”. Those are antibiotics reserved for treating the most difficult infections. This result was higher than anticipated. It underscored the need for laboratory data to indicate where antibiotic resistance was becoming a serious problem.
The good news was that two antibiotics, tigecycline and fosfomycin, remained very active even against highly resistant strains of bacteria. The bad news was that these antibiotics are expensive and not readily available in many hospitals in Africa.
Nevertheless, this data on the resistance patterns of multidrug resistant infections supports the value of regional guidelines. It points to strategies of antimicrobial stewardship that might work specifically in Nigeria. Such strategies could include judicious use of tigecycline or fosfomycin for serious infections when guided by laboratory data.

Our study went beyond the use of routine testing methods and included whole genome sequencing of the resistant bacteria. This was done to understand what made these organisms so resistant to antibiotics at the molecular level.
The data revealed an astonishingly high number of genetic mechanisms making the microorganisms resistant. This shows that the choice of agents to treat infections has not been optimal in the past.
Genes which inactivated some classes of antimicrobial agents such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones were present.
In some cases, the genetic information encoding resistance was capable of being shared among other microorganisms. This increases the potential for spread of the resistance problem.
Additionally, among the isolates studied, several belonged to newly emerging “high-risk” bacterial clones. These are bacterial species of high virulence that are easily spread among patient populations. Hospitals need to pay closer attention to infections caused by resistant bacteria to ensure infections do not spread to other patients.
The need for antimicrobial stewardship
Some of the resistance genes were capable of moving from one microorganism to another (mobile resistance genes). Other genes were embedded within the bacterial chromosome. Unlike the mobile genes, which can be unstable and lost, the ones in the chromosome are often stable. This mix of mobile and embedded resistance genes suggests that resistance will not go away any time soon.
However, there is hope for decreasing the impact of resistance through effective antibiotic prescribing. Antimicrobial stewardship based on laboratory data is effective especially if done locally, regionally and nationally.
Antimicrobial resistance is everyone’s concern
Four points are important for the public to note.
First, similar multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria have been detected in the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia. This is a global issue.
Second, the data could have been much worse. We did identify antibiotics that are still effective even against the most resistant bacterial strains we studied.
Third, there are efforts in place in Nigeria and other African countries to limit the spread of resistant microorganisms.

Fourth, there are things that everyone can do to help bring antibiotic resistance under control. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list five things that everyone should know about drug resistance and 10 activities to protect yourself and your family against resistance.
This is a global battle that we need to win.","Resistance to antibiotics in northern Nigeria: what bacteria are prevalent, and which drugs work against them",health + medicine
"The winds that whip the towns of the Eastern Cape in South Africa have the power to generate energy. But on a dry, hot day, those winds can gather up embers and dump them into tinder dry savannah and forest, destroying crops, fodder and homes, and taking lives.
Wild fires create their own weather systems, generating fire storms with devastating effects.
Global warming will increase the number of days of shimmering heat, creating the ideal conditions for fire. In the past months, southern Europe and North Africa have experienced record-breaking temperatures and fierce fires, and the terrible effects of both on human lives, habitat and environment. The southern hemisphere is next.
But heat, not fire, is the major cause of death worldwide. The extremes in Europe and the US augur future changes globally. Countries throughout southern Africa, parts of east Africa and Madagascar are all projected to face rapidly increasing temperatures to the end of this century.
I am an anthropologist and public health academic, working both in Australia and South Africa. Both countries are recurrently affected by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and resultant sea rise, with floods, drought and higher temperature in its wake. Global warming and El Niño combined suggest that the years ahead will result in increasing, devastating impacts.
Heat, air quality and health
As is clear from reports from multilateral agencies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and national bodies such as the US Global Change Research Program, high temperatures can be fatal, and vast populations worldwide are vulnerable.
High temperatures cause heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular disease.
South Africa will experience more heat waves, so more heat-related deaths are likely. People in informal settlements, and badly maintained and crowded buildings, are especially vulnerable to heat stress.
Cities are also hot spots. Heat absorbed by roads and buildings results in the urban “heat island effect”, while increased use of energy for cooling adds to greenhouse gas emissions.
Less food, lower nutrition
On the continent food security is directly threatened by extreme events, but also more broadly by climate change and global warming. In South Africa, drought recurrently affects subsistence agriculture, livestock and commercial crops. This has already stimulated interest in local coping strategies faced with food insecurity.
The impact of drought on food and nutrition will be felt by the most vulnerable, including infants, small children and pregnant women and those who already live on or below the poverty line.
Large numbers of people across the continent live as subsistence farmers, and in the absence of food or water we are likely to see increased migration and humanitarian crises.

In South Africa, too, a large proportion of the population relies on subsistence farming or other small-scale farming. Crop failure and drought, combined with increased food costs associated with disruptions to global food resources, will affect every one of us.

Every drop counts
Drought and water shortages add to these risk factors. Humans require adequate hydration to survive, and the combination of increasing temperatures and water shortages heightens the risk of organ failure and death.
In addition, dependence on poor quality and contaminated water has an impact on household and personal hygiene, and intestinal infections.
Vibrio cholerae – the bacteria that cause cholera – is present in waterways in both high and lower income countries, and infection can be mild. But increased concentrations of the bacteria without rapid intervention to prevent severe dehydration can be lethal. The sharp increase in cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases worldwide is associated with rising temperatures and drought.
Neglected diseases
Other viral and bacterial infectious diseases, especially prevalent in Africa, are also likely to increase with global warming. Bundled together as “neglected diseases of poverty”, these include both parasitic and viral vector borne diseases such as Rift Valley fever, malaria, filariasis, schistosomiasis, dengue fever, chikungunya and influenza as well as arboviruses such as different influenza pathogens.
The ways in which climate change will affect different vector borne disease will vary. Sluggish and stagnant waterways and polluted water sources are one risk factor.
There is growing evidence of mosquito migration to higher altitudes, infecting people who have not been exposed before.
At the same time, there is growing evidence of vector behavioural change and resistance to insecticides in some settings, including the Ifakara region of Tanzania.
So where does this leave us?
When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established in 1988, we had a choice to interrupt climate change and slow global warming.
Globalisation, national politics and global capitalism have meant we have failed, and 35 years on we face an inevitable crisis.
This does not mean there is nothing we can do to halt the destruction of planetary life.
It does require that we urgently and radically change how we provide and use energy, how we live, and how we change living conditions for those who are, by the circumstances of their everyday lives, most at risk of the lethal effects of global warming.",From fatal allergies to heart attacks and malaria – the devastating health effects of global warming in Africa,health + medicine
"As Africa gets hotter, mothers and babies are most at risk. Why is this and what can be done about it? Matthew Chersich, a specialist in climate change and maternal health, explains the reasons to health editor Nadine Dreyer.
What makes pregnant women particularly vulnerable to extreme heat?
Many women in Africa have little or no protection against extreme heat events, with pregnancy being an particularly vulnerable period. High ambient temperatures may overwhelm the capacity of the maternal thermoregulatory mechanisms to dissipate heat in pregnancy.
Foetal metabolism generates considerable heat in the mother’s body. Then there is the strain from additional weight gain in pregnancy, fat deposits that retain heat, and the major exertion of labour and childbirth.
The foetus remains around 0.5°C warmer than the mother and thus if a mother has heat stress or a fever, the foetal temperature quickly reaches dangerous levels.
The most dangerous period is likely during childbirth, when women generate remarkable levels of heat from the labour process. If this occurs during a heatwave it can increase complications, such as prolonged labour, increased emergency caesarean sections and maternal haemorrhage.
What makes babies particularly vulnerable?
Infants are dependent on their carers for protecting them against heat exposure. Some practices, such as over-swaddling, pose considerable risks as global temperatures rise.
Dehydration is also a major concern for young children, due to water loss through sweating or from gastroenteritis, which increases as food- and water-borne pathogens replicate more frequently and survive longer during warm weather.
Mothers may also supplement breastfeeding with water. In many areas, water is unsafe because of poor infrastructure.
Infants may breastfeed for shorter periods during hot weather as feeding can be uncomfortable for baby and mother in the heat.
In one of our studies in Burkina Faso, breastfeeding duration was about 25 minutes shorter on hot days compared to cold days.
It is possible to quantify the effect of climate change on pregnant women and newborn babies?
We are able to calculate the relative risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm birth, which increases about 1.15 fold during heatwaves. The key gap in the field is quantifying the absolute number of additional adverse outcomes that are occurring because of climate change.
Those figures would help people to appreciate the implications of climate change for maternal and child health. There are real concerns that extreme heat may reverse the previous gains made in maternal and child health, from childhood vaccines, for example.
In some of our work we estimated how many additional child deaths occurred in Africa from heat exposure. We showed that there were between 7,000 and 11,000 deaths from heat exposure in children in Africa annually that could be attributed to climate change. Unless we curb carbon emissions dramatically, heat-related child mortality in Africa may reach over 38,000 a year in 2049.
A study of pregnant women in Johannesburg showed that rates of severe hypertensive disorders in pregnancy increase by as much as 80% when temperatures exceed 23°C in early pregnancy.
Do different health issues affect mothers and children?
While the harms of exposure to extreme heat in pregnancy are well known, we do not yet have easy ways of calculating how much of that additional burden of disease is due to climate change, as opposed to natural variations in temperature. The methods for doing so are improving rapidly, however.
What is clear is that if South Africa experiences the kinds of temperatures that were seen in Europe and North America in 2023, there will be many thousands of additional pregnancy complications, all of which will be directly attributable to climate change.
What are some practical solutions?
There are a number of relatively simple, low cost “cooling” interventions which could be implemented at scale if countries in the global north kept to their funding commitments.
Each year high-income countries make major promises about climate financing, but have yet to deliver. They committed US$100 billion a year in the 2015 Paris Agreement and have delivered only a tiny fraction of that amount.
Low-cost interventions include painting roofs of houses or health facilities with white reflective paint, fans with evaporative cooling, providing cool water for women during labour and making “cooling centres” where women could go during a heatwave.
What can pregnant women and communities do to reduce risks?
On a local level there are behavioural changes that can benefit maternal health. Many pregnant women continue physical work even late in pregnancy, including walking long distances to collect water and firewood. A project in Burkina Faso and Kenya tested a community-mobilisation intervention that aimed to reduce heavy workloads during pregnancy and early motherhood. Results of the project are promising.
Major changes must be made to built environments. The temperatures in many informal settlements are higher indoors than they are outdoors, which can be devastating for expectant mothers. Higher night-time temperatures are especially concerning. Many healthcare facilities are similarly ill-equipped to provide pregnant women with cooler environments.
All the interventions mentioned above can provide some degree of protection against the current level of heat exposure women face, but will be poorly effective against the kinds of temperatures that we will experience in five to 10 years’ time.
We know almost nothing about what could be done to prevent mass mortality events at temperatures around 50-55°C in settings where air conditioning is not feasible and the population is not accustomed to those temperatures.",Why mothers and babies will suffer more as Africa grows hotter,health + medicine
"Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most affected by HIV. In Nigeria alone, an estimated 1.8 million people are living with the virus.
Antiretroviral therapy has made strong gains in reducing HIV-related deaths. But people living with HIV in resource-constrained settings, like Nigeria, still face psychological challenges and poor health outcomes that are attributed to HIV-related stigma.
The disclosure of HIV positive status has increased over the years in Africa. This has been linked to increased social support for people living with HIV: relationships and interactions that could have positive effects on a person’s health and well-being. Some researchers in a Chinese study have established that when people living with HIV are supported, their physical and mental quality of life is improved.
The challenge, however, is that some people face rejection and maltreatment from friends, family and important people in their lives following HIV disclosure. This has a negative effect on their mental health and HIV outcomes.
Many researchers have studied overall social support globally. Some have focused on specific support types, such as friendship. Less is known about how much support people living with HIV get from family and significant others like close colleagues or religious leaders.
Our team of scientists in HIV/AIDS research decided to bridge this knowledge gap in the Nigerian context. Our study aimed to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with support from family, friends and significant others. We also assessed whether increased support would reduce stigma among people living with HIV, particularly perceived or internalised stigma.
Social support
In our study, “significant others” was defined as people other than family members that someone feels close to. They could be a respected colleague or a religious leader.
We defined “social support” as moral, financial and emotional support that people received after disclosing their HIV positive status to friends, families, partners or religious leaders. For example, a friend of someone living with HIV could provide support by making sure that they took their HIV medications regularly.
A total of 396 people living with HIV were interviewed across six hospitals in Lagos State between June and July 2021.
The scores for three types of social support (family, friends and significant others) were combined to indicate overall social support.
We also asked respondents about their experience of stigma, their adherence to antiretroviral medication and other relevant medical histories, such as the duration of HIV diagnosis and how long they had been on HIV medication. This allowed us to investigate the association between experience of stigma, social support and HIV treatment adherence.

Friends reduce stigma
The average age of our respondents was 32 years and 59.8% were female. Most had been diagnosed with HIV within the past five years, and many had been on antiretroviral medication for a long time.
Only half of the respondents had adequate support from family, friends and significant others. We found that when people living with HIV received support from close friends, they were less likely to experience stigma.
Females enjoyed more support from significant others than males. The reason could be that females tended to disclose their HIV status to trustworthy persons sooner than males.

Also, we found that those who earned a higher monthly income had better support from significant others and had better overall support. It could be that some of the respondents got more support because they provided financial support to others. Monthly income was significantly associated with all types of social support among our respondents.
Generally, our study showed that people living with HIV in Nigeria who enjoyed support from family or friends were less likely to be affected by HIV-related stigma and associated poor health outcomes.
Our key message is that people living with HIV need social support from families, friends or significant others to improve their quality of life and reduce HIV-related stigma (especially internalised stigma).
Stigma and health outcomes
We intend to dig deeper into the association between social support, HIV-related stigma and viral suppression among people living with HIV in Nigeria.
We hope to gather empirical data on the impact of HIV-related stigma on mental health outcomes (for example, depression and anxiety) and viral suppression among people living with HIV.
Our long-term goal is to collaborate with a sample of people living with HIV in Nigeria to develop, implement and evaluate culturally acceptable stigma reduction interventions to improve HIV treatment uptake and overall health outcomes.

"For centuries, we have known that tuberculosis is a social disease. It thrives on poverty and social factors such as malnutrition, poor housing, overcrowding, unsafe work environments and stigma.
Globally in 2021 an estimated 2.2 million cases of TB were attributable to undernourishment, 0.86 million to HIV infection, 0.74 million to alcohol use disorders, 0.69 million to smoking and 0.37 million to diabetes.
But knowledge about social determinants alone does not always translate into tangible action and progress. A new trial in India, called RATIONS, aimed to determine the effect of nutritional supplementation on new cases of tuberculosis in households of adults with pulmonary TB. The research found that providing food baskets to people with TB and their households could go a long way to prevent and mitigate the disease.
No easy silver bullets
The TB community has typically looked for biomedical solutions, or “silver bullets”, for a social pathology, and we are struggling to make progress.
Since the COVID pandemic, TB mortality and incidence have increased globally, putting TB back on top as the single most deadly infectious killer of humankind.
In 2021, 1.6 million people died of TB. In Africa, TB incidence is high (212 per 100,000 population) with a high case fatality rate because of the HIV epidemic.

Undernutrition is the most important cause of TB. This has been shown in studies in many countries, including South Africa, where researchers found poor levels of nutrition in patients admitted to a specialised TB hospital.
Malnutrition refers to all forms of deficiencies in nutrition, including over-nutrition and obesity. Undernutrition refers more specifically to a deficiency of nutrients.
While we know that many patients with TB have poor nutrition, the latest evidence is that undernutrition also plays a key role in TB within households.
The results of the Reducing Activation of Tuberculosis by Improvement of Nutritional Status (RATIONS) trial show that improved nutrition in family members of patients with lung TB reduced all forms of TB by nearly 40%, and infectious TB by nearly 50%.
This trial recruited 10,345 household members of 2,800 patients with lung TB.
All TB patients received a monthly 10kg food basket (rice, pulses, milk powder, oil) and multivitamins for six months.
In one group family members received 5kg rice and 1.5kg pulses per person per month, while the other group of family members did not get food baskets.
Food worked like a vaccine in this trial, cutting the risk of household members developing TB.
Nutrition could also protect against other conditions such as anaemia, diarrhoea and respiratory infections, but these were not not the main focus of the trial.
An accompanying paper, based on the results of the RATIONS trial, showed that severe undernutrition was present in nearly half of all patients.
An early weight gain in the first two months was associated with 60% lower risk of TB mortality. The other benefits were higher treatment success and better weight gain. During the six-month follow-up period, a remarkable treatment success rate of 94% was achieved.
Getting food to patients
How expensive was the intervention? The cost of a food basket was US$13 per TB patient per month and US$4 per household member per month and could be delivered, even in rural areas, using field staff.
Even before the RATIONS trial, the Indian government had recognised the need for nutrition support for people with TB, and in 2018 launched “Nikshay Poshan Yojana”, a direct benefit transfer scheme. Under this scheme, each TB patient receives a financial incentive of US$6 per month for the duration of the anti-TB treatment (typically, six months for people with drug-sensitive TB).
Emerging data suggests that while the scheme improves the treatment completion rates among patients with TB in India, they often receive their payments late. There is a need to improve the efficiency and provide timely payments.
The new RATIONS trial suggests that directly providing food baskets may be another effective strategy.
Many countries, including India, have other social security programmes, including public distribution systems  to provide food grains at subsidised prices. Using existing channels to provide extra food rations to people with TB, and expanding the menu to include proteins such as pulses and millets, is a strategy worth exploring. This could also have positive effects on other diseases such as diabetes.
Implications for South Africa
South Africa is one of the countries labelled by the World Health Organization as a “high TB burden country”.
What does this latest research mean for South Africa? Statistics South Africa reported that in 2021 2.6 million people had inadequate access to food and a further 1.1 million stated they had “severe” inadequate access to food. More than 683,000 children five years and younger experienced hunger.
This toxic mix requires prevention of TB by nutritional support, drugs to prevent TB infections and early diagnosis with molecular tests and treatment.
With high levels of food insecurity and undernutrition in South Africa, fuelled by the highest levels of inequality, it is critical that South Africa includes social benefits for people with TB and those in their households to reduce the prevalence of TB in the country and to meet the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.
Regardless of how social benefits are distributed, action must be based on evidence. We need better tests, cures and vaccines for TB, but they alone cannot end the epidemic.

"Suicide is a complex behaviour that is widely regarded as a significant public health issue across the globe. It is influenced by psychiatric, psychological, biological, social, cultural, economic and existential factors. In most countries, the rate of male suicides is between 3 and 7.5 times higher than that of females even though suicide ideation (thoughts) and attempts are more frequent for females.
The World Health Organization reported in 2020 that approximately 1,993 suicides occurred in Ghana annually. A report in Ghana on suicide attempt trends over four years also revealed that 707 suicide attempts occurred in 2018, 880 in 2019, 777 in 2020 and 417 as of June 2021.
Studies continue to reveal a disproportionately high number of males in both suicide and attempted suicide in Ghana. Suicidal behaviour in Ghana is a predominantly male problem – which is one reason it’s of interest to me as a psychologist who studies men’s mental health.
I undertook a study that focused on the way loss of job and income influenced relationships with close family members prior to suicide. This is not to suggest that loss of income or job is the only cause of men’s suicide in Ghana. Other studies have highlighted chronic illness, substance use, interpersonal conflict and loss, marital challenges, economic difficulties, perceived shame, and mental illness as other contributing factors.
My study used a qualitative research approach, interviewing 21 close relatives and friends of nine men who had all suffered some economic challenges in ways that affected their relationships with family members. All nine had died by suicide.
Even though these men lived in social settings that valued mutual support and reciprocal obligations, some of them suffered abandonment during their economic difficulties. Even those who could depend on spouses in their situation appeared to find that dependency emasculating.
Men and suicide
The term gender paradox in relation to suicide describes the observation where females have higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviour than males, yet mortality from suicide is typically lower for females compared to males.
Biologically, it is suggested that testosterone, which is linked to impulsivity and aggression, is about ten times higher in males than in females. Thus the likelihood for males to engage in risky behaviours including aggression towards themselves is linked to high testosterone levels.
The high male suicide rate is also connected to gender stereotypes and role socialisation. Society expects certain things of men.
The patriarchal nature of most societies in Africa makes being economically independent a key social expectation of being a man. Men are expected to be employed, with a regular income, and to start a family.
Family support in Ghana
My study highlighted Ghana’s extended family system. This system encourages support and care for one another, belonging and seeking help in times of adversity. The study found that the deceased men had perceived being a burden, loss of respect, social abandonment and anxiety when faced with crises like job losses and financial difficulties. The relative of one of the deceased stated:
I even got angry the day this incident (suicide) happened. People even said we have been starving him, etc, etc. For Christ sake, he was 27 years. Must I keep on taking care of him?
A friend of another deceased person said:
His relatives visited him a lot when he was doing well in business but they stopped visiting when his problems started.
Thus a dysfunctional, transactional social system existed around them. The implicit rule appeared to be that the victims were as valuable as their ability to provide for others and be economically independent.
The finding aligns with an earlier study in Ghana that shows that the motivation for male suicides is not that men seek to reject their social responsibilities. Instead,
it is an intense sense of personal responsibility towards meeting prescribed social norms and roles associated with gender.
My study also found that even though it was possible for some of the men to depend on their wealthier wives during economic difficulty, doing so created distress. Depending on their wives and seeing them assume hitherto “male” roles were seen as emasculating.
A spouse illustrated:
He felt that due to the problems he was going through, there were some responsibilities I was not supposed to do as a wife that I was doing and all of those thing got him worried.
Where they were intent to live as benevolent patriachs in line with internalised masculine codes, their economic predicament constrained the men’s social roles and created distress.
As another spouse explained:
Things were not going so well with his job, it got to the extent that he could not help people the way he wanted to, and he was worried.
Men as providers
The findings of this study highlight the patriachal system that defines men partly in terms of their capacity to provide materially for others. Men who strictly adhere to such male norms may struggle to adjust when they have to depend on others, including their spouses. The extended family system should support such men emotionally and materially, but some family members chose to abandon them.
Public education is vital to change unhealthy gender norms that affect men in social and economic adversity. It will enable men to learn effective ways of coping and alternative ways of being men. Education will also help change societal notions of who a man is and foster more support in times of adversity.",Suicide in Ghana: society expects men to be providers – new study explores this pressure,health + medicine
"Traditional medicines are part of the cultural heritage of many Africans. About 80% of the African continent’s population use these medicines for healthcare.
Other reasons include affordability, accessibility, patient dissatisfaction with conventional medicine, and the common misconception that “natural” is “safe”.
The growing recognition of traditional medicine resulted in the first World Health Organization global summit on the topic, in August 2023, with the theme “Health and Wellbeing for All”.
Traditional medicines are widely used in South Africa, with up to 60% of South Africans estimated to be reliant on traditional medicine as a primary source of healthcare .
Conventional South African healthcare facilities struggle to cope with extremely high patient numbers. The failure to meet the basic standards of healthcare, with increasing morbidity and mortality rates, poses a threat to the South African economy.
In my opinion, as a qualified pharmacist and academic with a research focus on traditional medicinal plant use in South Africa, integrating traditional medicine practices into modern healthcare systems can harness centuries of indigenous knowledge, increasing treatment options and provide better healthcare.
Recognition of traditional medicine as an alternative or joint source of healthcare to that of standard, conventional medicine has proven challenging. This is due to the absence of scientific research establishing and documenting the safety and effectiveness of traditional medicines, along with the lack of regulatory controls.
What are traditional medicines?
Traditional medicine encompasses a number of healthcare practices aimed at either preventing or treating acute or chronic complaints through the application of indigenous knowledge, beliefs and approaches. It incorporates the use of plant, animal and mineral-based products. Plant-derived products form the majority of treatment regimens.
Traditional medicine practices also have a place in ritualistic activities and communicating with ancestors.
South Africa is rich in indigenous medicinal fauna and flora, with about 2,000 species of plants traded for medicinal purposes. In South Africa the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and Limpopo are trading “hotspots”. The harvested plants are most often sold at traditional medicine muthi markets.
Uses of medicinal plants
Medicinal plants most popularly traded in South Africa include buchu, bitter aloe, African wormwood, honeybush, devil’s claw, hoodia, African potato, fever tea, African geranium, African ginger, cancer bush, pepperbark tree, milk bush and the very commonly consumed South African beverage, rooibos tea.

There are many ways in which traditional medicine may be used. It can be a drop in the eye or the ear, a poultice applied to the skin, a boiled preparation for inhalation or a tea brewed for oral administration.
Roots, bulbs and bark are used most often, and leaves less frequently. Roots are available throughout the year. There’s also a belief that the roots have the strongest concentration of “medicine”. Harvesting of the roots, however, poses concerns about the conservation of these medicinal plants. The South African government, with the draft policy on African traditional medicine Notice 906 of 2008 outlines considerations aimed at ensuring the conservation of these plants through counteracting unsustainable harvesting practises.
Obstacles to traditional medicine use
The limited research investigating interactions posed should a patient be making use of both traditional and conventional medicine is a concern.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients used traditional remedies for the prevention of infection or treatment.
Understanding which traditional medicines are being used and how, their therapeutic effects in the human body, and how they interact with conventional medicines, would help determine safety of their combined use.
Certain combinations may have advantageous interactions, increasing the efficacy or potency of the medicines and allowing for reduced dosages, thereby reducing potential toxicity. These combinations could assist in the development of new pharmaceutical formulations.
Sharing information
The WHO in its Traditional Medicine Strategy for 2014-2023 report emphasised the need for using traditional medicine to achieve increased healthcare.
Key role players from both systems of healthcare need to be able to share information freely.
The need for policy development is key. Both conventional and traditional medicine practitioners would need to be aware of and engage with patients on all the medicines they are taking.
Understanding the whole patient
Patients often seek treatment from both conventional and traditional sources, which can lead to side effects or duplication in medications.
A comprehensive understanding of a patient’s health profile makes care easier.
This could also prevent treatment failures, promote patient safety, prevent adverse interactions and minimise risks.
A harmonious healthcare landscape would combine the strengths of both systems to provide better healthcare for all.",South Africa’s traditional medicines should be used in modern health care,health + medicine
"Hypertension, commonly referred to as high blood pressure, is a non-communicable disease that occurs when there is a sustained elevation in the pressure of the blood that flows through the arteries.
Adults in low- and middle-income countries account for around 75% of the global cases.
High blood pressure is a manageable condition through regular monitoring, lifestyle changes and treatment. However, untreated blood pressure, also known as uncontrolled hypertension, can lead to damage to organs such as the kidneys, heart and brain. All this increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and other serious health issues.
Globally, uncontrolled hypertension is a leading contributor to death.
In Kenya, the 2014-2015 national survey on non-communicable diseases showed that high blood pressure contributed to a significant burden of disease. About one in four people have high blood pressure in the country. The hypertension prevalence for Kenya (24.5%) is slightly lower than that of neighbouring countries such as Tanzania (26%) and Uganda (26.4%).

Research suggests that urban slum residents are 35% more likely to be hypertensive than people living in rural areas. In Nairobi, Kenya’s capital city, around 60% of the population lives in slums or slum-like conditions. Previous research in Kenya’s urban slums shows high uncontrolled hypertension rates.
In our recent study, my colleagues and I wanted to understand the range of factors that put these people at risk for uncontrolled hypertension or protects them from it.
We found that the low socio-economic status of the slum residents, coupled with high medication prices, limited treatment.
Gaps in care persist in urban areas
Nairobi’s slum dwellers experience sub-optimal access to essential services. They face conditions that make informal settlements vulnerable to emergencies such as disease outbreaks and natural disasters.
Even though there are effective treatments for hypertension, gaps in care persist in urban areas in Kenya, particularly among the poorest communities.
Our research aimed at understanding the barriers to blood pressure control at various levels – individual, family and community, health system and policy.
We collected data through interviews and focus groups in two Nairobi slums: Korogocho and Viwandani. We interviewed people who had uncontrolled hypertension, aiming to understand their experiences and perspectives about their care.
Healthcare providers were interviewed to gather information about their prescription practices, adherence to national guidelines and knowledge of hypertension.
We also interviewed decision-makers and policymakers to gain their views on the challenges faced in getting hypertension care in the study community.
The research identified barriers to blood pressure control across all the levels studied. Major bottlenecks were the high cost of hypertension medicines, the constant unavailability of medicines at health facilities, and an unsupportive family and environment.
In this study, access to medication was a major barrier to blood pressure control.
Countries such as Eritrea and South Africa provide free hypertension medications at the community level.
In Kenya, however, free medication is provided only at higher-level health facilities. Slum residents have access to lower-level facilities which are not mandated to provide hypertension medications.
So what can be done?
A viable approach is to implement programmes with interventions capable of addressing the complex array of factors influencing hypertension care.
For instance, the provision of free or subsidised medicines would remove barriers that hinder patients’ access to hypertension medication.
It’s also essential to implement policies and directives to ensure equitable care for all, including those in slum communities seeking care at lower-level health facilities.",Living in Nairobi’s slums is tough – residents are 35% more likely to suffer from high blood pressure than those in rural areas,health + medicine
"Imagine the weight of responsibility for caring for a child when you are not yet fully grown yourself, and the fear of being shamed by parents, fellow learners, and even strangers within the community?
Vast numbers of adolescent mothers, many of them very vulnerable, exist across Africa, but there remains little research on their challenges and what can be done to support them and their children.
Policies and programmes are often small scale, poorly implemented, or not inclusive of adolescent parents.
Detailing findings from the largest adolescent mother cohort study in sub-Saharan Africa, this article sheds light on some of the challenges they face, potential entry points for interventions and programmes, and opportunities to support adolescent mothers and their children.
Some adolescent mothers from sub-Saharan Africa say they did not realise they could get pregnant or how to prevent pregnancies, pointing to the challenges to provide youth with comprehensive sex education and the possible cultural obstacles to communication about sexunderlying early pregnancy.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic sparked an education crisis, nearly one in five girls  aged between 15 and 19 globally were not in school, employment or training.
Many adolescent mothers have a history of poor school performance, and a pregnancy can act as a catalyst for early dropout.
The HEY BABY (Helping Empower Youth Brought up in Adversity with their Babies and Young children) research study was conceptualised to better understand adolescent mothers’ needs.
The study aimed to identify the hurdles young mothers face and how to overcome them. Between 2017 and 2019, HEY BABY collected data from over 1,000 adolescent mothers and their children living in rural and urban areas of South Africa’s Eastern Cape.
Addressing mothers’ obstacles and identified points of intervention
Prior research, using older samples, from South Africa indicates that only between 30%and 50% of young mothers manage to continue their education, highlighting a continued need to understand better why this is the case.
Our most recent study showed that almost 70% of young mothers indicate having returned to school after birth. These mothers showed lower poverty rates, fewer repeated grades preceding the pregnancy, continued schooling during pregnancy, higher daycare/crèche use, more family childcare support, and lower engagement in exclusive breastfeeding within six months of birth.
Examining the relationship between poverty and school enrolment within this population, we identified two distinct routes towards a return to school:
Route one: Lower household poverty drives schooling throughout pregnancy which, in turn, drives higher school return rates post-birth;
Route two: Lower household poverty drives the use of daycare/crèche services which, in turn, drives higher school return rates post-birth.
The large proportion of mothers - 30% in our sample - who do not return to school might require substantial targeted support to re-engage with education.
Our results suggest that financial support alone might not be sufficient to support adolescent mothers. But when combined with other resources, such as affordable daycare and services that support school retention during pregnancy, they could prove effective.
This evidence aligns with the growing interest in cash-plus programmes  which provide cash payments in addition to complementary interventions to strengthen outcomes. This type of intervention might help adolescent mothers to continue their education.
Further research from the HEY BABY team provides valuable insights into maternal education and its potential drivers and consequences:
Better maternal education is associated with increased child cognitive development.
Withdrawal from school during pregnancy is associated with more poverty, higher grade repetitions and greater lack of information about the pregnancy.
Some adolescent mothers face compound risks. For example adolescent motherhood and HIV-infection double the chances of dropping out of school.
Food security is associated with both education and lowered HIV behaviours, including age-disparate sex and sex on substances.
Access to formal childcare services has a substantial positive impact for adolescent mothers such as engagement with education and employment, optimism about the future, and improved parenting) and showed better child development over time.
Evidence to improve the implementation of school policies
Progressive laws and school policies, and their effective implementation, are essential to increase school access for pregnant girls and adolescent mothers.
In South Africa, a national policy assigns the responsibility for managing the care and support for adolescent mothers to individual schools. These schools need to know how to provide effective and targeted help, and which community networks to tap into.
Establishing and promoting education, health, and social systems that are responsive to the rights and needs of pregnant girls and adolescent mothers will require that the policy implementation is grounded in robust evidence.
Only then can we effectively improve the lives of adolescent mothers and our future generations.",Teen mums in South Africa: largest ever study explores what it takes to go back to school,education
"We expect medical professionals to give us reliable information about ourselves and potential treatments so that we can make informed decisions about which (if any) medicine or other intervention we need. If your doctor instead “bullshits” you (yes – this term has been used in academic publications to refer to persuasion without regard for truth, and not as a swear word) under the deception of authoritative medical advice, the decisions you make could be based on faulty evidence and may result in harm or even death.
Bullshitting is distinct from lying – liars do care about the truth and actively try to conceal it. Indeed bullshitting can be more dangerous than an outright lie. Fortunately, of course, doctors don’t tend to bullshit – and if they did there would be, one hopes, consequences through ethics bodies or the law. But what if the misleading medical advice didn’t come from a doctor?
By now, most people have heard of ChatGPT, a very powerful chatbot. A chatbot is an algorithm-powered interface that can mimic human interaction. The use of chatbots is becoming increasingly widespread, including for medical advice.
Read more: ChatGPT's greatest achievement might just be its ability to trick us into thinking that it's honest
In a recent paper, we looked at ethical perspectives on the use of chatbots for medical advice. Now, while ChatGPT, or similar platforms, might be useful and reliable for finding out the best places to see in Dakar, to learn about wildlife, or to get quick potted summaries of other topics of interest, putting your health in its hands may be playing Russian roulette: you might get lucky, but you might not.
This is because chatbots like ChatGPT try to persuade you without regard for truth. Its rhetoric is so persuasive that gaps in logic and facts are obscured. This, in effect, means that ChatGPT includes the generation of bullshit.
The gaps
The issue is that ChatGPT is not really artificial intelligence in the sense of actually recognising what you’re asking, thinking about it, checking the available evidence, and giving a justified response. Rather, it looks at the words you’re providing, predicts a response that will sound plausible and provides that response.
This is somewhat similar to the predictive text function you may have used on mobile phones, but much more powerful. Indeed, it can provide very persuasive bullshit: often accurate, but sometimes not. That’s fine if you get bad advice about a restaurant, but it’s very bad indeed if you’re assured that your odd-looking mole is not cancerous when it is.
Another way of looking at this is from the perspective of logic and rhetoric. We want our medical advice to be scientific and logical, proceeding from the evidence to personalised recommendations regarding our health. In contrast, ChatGPT wants to sound persuasive even if it’s talking bullshit.
For example, when asked to provide citations for its claims, ChatGPT often makes up references to literature that doesn’t exist – even though the provided text looks perfectly legitimate. Would you trust a doctor who did that?
Dr ChatGPT vs Dr Google
Now, you might think that Dr ChatGPT is at least better than Dr Google, which people also use to try to self-diagnose.
In contrast to the reams of information provided by Dr Google, chatbots like ChatGPT give concise answers very quickly. Of course, Dr Google can fall prey to misinformation too, but it does not try to sound convincing.
Using Google or other search engines to identify verified and trustworthy health information (for instance, from the World Health Organization) can be very beneficial for citizens. And while Google is known for capturing and recording user data, such as terms used in searches, using chatbots may be worse.
Read more: ChatGPT is a data privacy nightmare. If you’ve ever posted online, you ought to be concerned
Beyond potentially being misleading, chatbots may record data on your medical conditions and actively request more personal information, leading to more personalised – and possibly more accurate – bullshit. Therein lies the dilemma. Providing more information to chatbots may lead to more accurate answers, but also gives away more personal health-related information. However, not all chatbots are like ChatGPT. Some may be more specifically designed for use in medical settings, and advantages from their use may outweigh potential disadvantages.
What to do
So what should you do if you’re tempted to use ChatGPT for medical advice despite all this bullshit?
The first rule is: don’t use it.
But if you do, the second rule is that you should check the accuracy of the chatbot’s response – the medical advice provided may or may not be true. Dr Google can, for instance, point you in the direction of reliable sources. But, if you’re going to do that anyway, why risk receiving bullshit in the first place?
The third rule is to provide chatbots with information sparingly. Obviously, the more personalised data you offer, the better the medical advice you get. And it can be difficult to withhold information as most of us willingly and voluntarily give up information on mobile phones and various websites anyway. Adding to this, chatbots can also ask for more. But more data for chatbots like ChatGPT could also lead to more persuasive and even personalised inaccurate medical advice.
Talking bullshit and misuse of personal data is certainly not our idea of a good doctor.",Chatbots for medical advice: three ways to avoid misleading information,health + medicine
"Two decades ago there were only two criteria used to diagnose concussion. Jon Patricios, a sport and exercise medicine physician and co-lead author of the latest international consensus statement on concussion in sport, discusses the science of head injuries and some of the protocols adopted by World Rugby to make the game safer.
What is concussion?
Concussion is a traumatic brain injury that occurs as a result of a force that’s transmitted to the brain. It manifests as a functional change in the way the brain operates. Most are transient and resolve completely if recognised and managed appropriately.
Usually, we don’t see structural changes in the brain in the case of a concussion. In other words the brain scans look normal. And so what we have available to us, what I call the visible wound, is the changes in brain function.
That’s what we as medical professionals treating concussion look for, what we assess and what we manage.
What are the obvious signs of concussion?
Things like loss of consciousness, or a seizure, clear disorientation, or inability to walk or poor coordination.
When I started working with professional rugby players in 1995 as a rugby team doctor there were only two criteria which classified you as concussed. One was a loss of consciousness, and the other was amnesia (memory loss). We now have over 20 criteria that we look for including irritability, nausea, inability to concentrate, poor balance, emotional changes and heart rate.
The one thing medical science still doesn’t have for concussion is what we call biomarkers – like a blood test, or a saliva test, or an appropriate brain scan. Once developed, these would be able to tell you if there’s a concussion, how bad it is and whether it’s resolving. Research in these fields is increasing exponentially and I think we will see these commercially available in the next five years.
What are the less obvious signs?
Much of the time the signs are subtle. Things like changes in movement. There may be symptoms which you rely on the patient reporting. We break those symptoms and signs down into what we call domains, which means we look at various aspects of brain and body function.
Those include physical symptoms, like headaches and nausea. They also may include changes in balance, emotional changes, anxiety, concentration – those sorts of things.
They often include cognitive changes like an inability to concentrate. Also what we call autonomic functions like heart rate, which might not be regulated properly, and blood pressure changes.
If one doesn’t take the athlete through a systematic approach one might miss some of the changes.
The other important thing is to “know the athlete” – understand what they are like before and injury. Evaluating the player before the season starts so you have a better understanding of how that player normally operates.
A player is knocked out cold on the field. What are the next steps?
The first thing is to treat it as you would any serious injury. And that’s to make sure the player is still functioning physiologically: the airways are open, they are breathing and their circulation is adequate. That’s the “ABC” of emergency medicine.
The second thing is to see if there are any serious injuries. For example, if the player has a neck injury. So you protect the airway and you protect the neck.
The next important aspect is to remove the player from further danger. You get them off the field where you can better assess them and monitor recovery, in an ordered, controlled, quieter medical space.
From there, you will work through your systematic evaluation, and assess which areas are most likely to have been affected.
You will repeat that evaluation within an hour or two and then within another day to see how they are improving (or not).
Often long rest periods are prescribed. Why?
As with every injury, there’s a spectrum of concussions and probably every one is slightly different.
You might have had a more severe injury, a high impact, with a player who is highly symptomatic, and has a number of domains that manifest. Not just their physical symptoms, but their concentration, their emotions and their balance.
Long periods of rest might not necessarily be appropriate. So what we’ll talk about is longer periods of relative rest, where you don’t cocoon them but allow them to continue with activities of daily living and then purposefully incorporate exercise within 72 hours. We actually expose them to exercise gradually but early, but at a lower intensity. It has been shown to actually speed recovery if you introduce gradual exercise in an appropriate way, early in the recovery stage.
Do the rules make the game safer now? Is it safe enough?
The rules have changed to improve identification of concussions and player safety.
In most collision sports, a player is obliged to go through a specific process before being allowed to return to the field. And these processes in the professional game have to be documented, and submitted before that player is allowed back.
The laws have been driven by the science behind concussion, which is encouraging.
Is it safe enough? Well, in collision sports you can never take concussions out of the game. Because as long as there’s a potential to be involved in a tackle or to be hit by a fist there’s the risk of injury. But safety awareness is higher than it’s ever been, and our protocols are evidence-based and more robust.",Concussion: what it is and how sports science is making rugby safer,health + medicine
"La mort récente de plus de 300 enfants en Afrique et en Asie a incité l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) à mettre en garde contre l'utilisation de produits médicaux “non conformes aux normes et falsifiés”. L'organisation a appelé à redoubler d'efforts pour protéger les enfants contre les médicaments contaminés. Les toxicologues Winston Morgan et Shazma Bashir décortiquent l'histoire.
Qu'est-ce qui a poussé l'OMS à lancer ces avertissements ?
Au cours des cinq derniers mois, l'OMS a émis trois alertes mettant en garde contre l'utilisation de certains médicaments en vente libre destinés aux enfants. Ces alertes ont été émises après le décès d'au moins 300 enfants dans divers pays, dont la Gambie, l'Indonésie et l'Ouzbékistan.
Les alertes concernant les produits médicaux ont été diffusées en octobre 2022 pour l'Afrique, en novembre 2022 pour l'Asie du Sud-Est et en janvier 2023 pour la région européenne.
L'OMS émet ces mises en garde uniquement lorsque des analyses effectuées par des laboratoires indépendants ont confirmé que le produit est de qualité inférieure ou falsifié et qu'il représente une menace importante pour la santé publique. La menace doit également s'étendre au-delà d'un seul pays.
Les enfants sont décédés après avoir consommé du sirop contre la toux contaminé par de l'éthylène glycol et du diéthylène glycol, ce qui a conduit à l'émission des alertes de l'OMS sur les produits médicaux. Certains de ces enfants n'avaient que cinq ans. Des cas ont été signalés dans au moins sept pays.
Que sont l'éthylène glycol et le diéthylène glycol ?
L'éthylène glycol et le diéthylène glycol sont des alcools toxiques au goût légèrement sucré. Ils sont largement utilisés dans les liquides d'essuie-glaces et les liquides de refroidissement des moteurs.
On retrouve parfois ces composés à de très faibles niveaux comme contaminants dans de nombreux ingrédients alimentaires et solvants médicaux (notamment le propylène glycol, le polyéthylène glycol, le sorbitol et la glycérine/glycérol). Cela se produit lorsque les normes de fabrication et d'essai sont insuffisantes.
Les solvants médicaux sont largement utilisés pour dissoudre les ingrédients d'un médicament. Au fil des ans, les intoxications par contamination à l'éthylène glycol et au diéthylène glycol ont été principalement associées à des solutions contenant du paracétamol.
Le paracétamol contenu dans les sirops contre la toux est bon et sûr pour les enfants souffrant d'infections. C'est un analgésique qui permet de réduire la fièvre, sans provoquer d'irritation gastrique comme peuvent le faire l'aspirine ou l'ibruprofène.
Sont-ils dangereux ?
L'éthylène glycol et le diéthylène glycol sont tous deux considérés comme toxiques. Une dose orale fatale est d'environ 1 000 à 1 500 milligrammes par kilogramme. Pour un petit enfant de 20 kg, une dose unique mortelle serait d'environ 28 millilitres ou 6 cuillères à café d'éthylène glycol pur. Cependant, il est également possible de provoquer une toxicité en consommant des doses beaucoup plus faibles sur plusieurs jours et semaines. C'est pourquoi le niveau de sécurité de l'OMS pour ces produits chimiques n'est que de 0,5 milligramme par kilogramme et par jour. C'est l'équivalent de 1/15e de cuillère à café par jour.
Ce qui rend ces glycols potentiellement si dangereux, c'est que la toxicité provient de la consommation de quantités relativement importantes avant l'apparition des symptômes de contamination.
Le danger supplémentaire des sirops contre la toux est que les symptômes de contamination par l'éthylène glycol et le diéthylène glycol, comme la somnolence, sont parfois observés chez des enfants qui n'ont pas pris de médicaments contaminés, et peuvent être interprétés à tort comme normaux chez un enfant qui tousse ou a de la fièvre. Les tuteurs et les professionnels de la santé peuvent ne pas remarquer ce qui ne va pas jusqu'à ce qu'il soit trop tard.
Quel est le rôle du paracétamol ?
Pour comprendre le rôle potentiel du paracétamol dans ces intoxications, nous devons comprendre ce que devient l'éthynel et le diéthylène une fois dans l'organisme.
Pour être toxiques, ces glycols doivent être convertis en un composé appelé glycoaldéhyde, puis en acide glyoxylique. L'acide glyoxylique peut se concentrer dans les reins et les endommager, ce qui peut entraîner la mort par insuffisance rénale.
La conversion est déclenchée par une certaine concentration d'une coenzyme appelée nicotinamide adénine dinucléotide (NAD+). Le NAD+ est régulé par les mitochondries - de petites structures dans les cellules humaines qui régulent de nombreuses réactions chimiques dans l'organisme.
Dans une étude récente, nous avons démontré qu'à la dose normale requise pour traiter la fièvre, le paracétamol inhibe les mitochondries. Il affecte donc le niveau de NAD+ et, à son tour, la conversion des glycols en toxines. Les enfants prenant des préparations de paracétamol contaminées par les glycols pourraient potentiellement être en danger.
Nous pensons que la combinaison de médicaments contenant du paracétamol et des glycols, même lorsque la contamination est relativement faible mais supérieure à la limite acceptable de l'OMS de 0,5 mg/kg de poids corporel par jour, pourrait être mortelle.
Contrairement à d'autres médicaments ou produits alimentaires qui ne perturbent pas la fonction mitochondriale, les préparations contenant des niveaux standard de paracétamol sont plus susceptibles d'entraîner des effets indésirables chez les enfants, en raison du métabolisme accru de l'éthylène glycol et du diéthylène glycol.
D'autres médicaments et aliments contaminés par de faibles niveaux d'éthylène glycol et de diéthylène glycol passent probablement inaperçus car ils ne contiennent pas de paracétamol.
Que faut-il faire pour éviter de nouveaux décès ?
S'il est détecté suffisamment tôt, l'empoisonnement à l'éthylène glycol et au diéthylène glycol peut être traité. Les deux antidotes les plus utilisés en cas de surdosage sont le fomépizole et l'éthanol. Tous deux réduisent la quantité de métabolite toxique d'éthylène glycol et de diéthylène glycol produite dans l'organisme.
Les incidents d'empoisonnements massifs soulignent la nécessité d'une plus grande vigilance dans la surveillance des préparations contenant du paracétamol.
Les médicaments contenant du paracétamol sont normalement très sûrs pour les enfants. Mais pour éviter les décès liés au sirop pour la toux à l'avenir, les parents et les professionnels de la santé doivent envisager la possibilité d'un empoisonnement au glycol si les enfants commencent à présenter des symptômes d'intoxication et de somnolence après avoir pris le médicament.
Ces incidents se produisent généralement dans des pays classés dans la catégorie des pays du Sud. Les fabricants et les autorités de régulation de ces pays ont également la responsabilité de protéger les enfants.",Le sirop contre la toux peut nuire aux enfants : les experts mettent en garde contre les risques de contamination,science + tech
"Le système immunitaire est sans doute le système le plus complexe du corps humain. Mais les scientifiques ont fait beaucoup de progrès dans la compréhension de son fonctionnement.
Il est important pour comprendre les maladies et savoir comment les gérer. Par exemple, il faut comprendre qu'une réponse immunitaire met plusieurs jours à se développer pleinement. Cette connaissance devrait permettre d'éviter que les gens ne s'impatientent et ne recherchent des soins inappropriés.
Le système immunitaire est constitué d'un réseau complexe de cellules, de tissus et de molécules. Ceux-ci contrôlent l'équilibre délicat entre l'élimination des cellules cancéreuses ou infectées et le fait de ne pas nuire à l'organisme au cours du processus.
Un système immunitaire qui fonctionne mal peut causer divers problèmes de santé.
Il peut conduire une personne à contracter des infections récurrentes. Selon la nature de la déficience immunitaire, les infections peuvent être virales (rhume, grippe, zona et boutons de fièvre), bactériennes (tuberculose) ou fongiques (muguet).
Le dysfonctionnement du système immunitaire peut également se manifester par une inflammation excessive, voire une auto-immunité. Dans ce cas, l'organisme commence à considérer ses propres tissus comme étrangers et les attaque. La polyarthrite rhumatoïde, le lupus et le psoriasis sont des exemples de ces pathologies.
Les facteurs qui affectent notre système immunitaire vont de choses que nous ne pouvons pas changer, comme notre constitution génétique et notre exposition à des agents pathogènes passés, à des choses que nous pouvons contrôler ou modifier.
Je suis immunologiste et, dans cet article, je présente les changements que vous pouvez adopter aujourd'hui pour aider votre système immunitaire à mieux fonctionner. Il s'agit notamment de l'alimentation, de la gestion du stress et de la limitation de l'exposition aux facteurs environnementaux, tels que les germes, la pollution et les toxines.
Une fonction immunitaire optimale joue un rôle important dans le maintien de la santé. Étant donné l'immense complexité du système immunitaire, les solutions simplistes ne sont pas efficaces. Il est important de comprendre certaines choses que vous devez - et ne devez pas - faire.
Ce qu'il ne faut pas faire
De nombreux produits prétendent “booster” le système immunitaire. Mais étant donné l'interaction complexe entre les cellules de notre corps, il n'est pas vraiment possible de “stimuler” une seule partie du système immunitaire.
Et même si c'était possible, “booster” un aspect de votre système immunitaire peut déclencher de mauvaises réactions en perturbant l'équilibre délicat qui compose notre corps. Par exemple, “booster” la capacité du système immunitaire à combattre les infections pourrait également “booster” d'autres aspects, comme l'inflammation, qui pourraient nuire aux tissus normaux.
Il est vrai que le système immunitaire s'appuie sur les vitamines et les minéraux pour fonctionner. Mais il n'existe aucune preuve solide que la prise de suppléments de vitamines et de minéraux améliore son fonctionnement.
L'exception est lorsqu'une personne présente une carence connue, comme une carence en vitamine D. La plupart des personnes souffrant d'une carence en vitamine D ne présentent aucun symptôme ou seulement des symptômes vagues et non spécifiques, tels que la fatigue ou des douleurs lombaires. Les personnes souffrant d'ostéoporose, de diabète, de maladie rénale, d'obésité ou de dépression, ou celles qui s'exposent peu au soleil, en particulier les personnes âgées, ont un risque accru de présenter une carence. Il est important de s'attaquer à ce problème car il peut augmenter le risque de fractures, ainsi que d'infections dues à divers agents pathogènes, notamment ceux qui affectent les poumons, comme la grippe et le COVID-19.
Si vous pensez souffrir d'une carence en nutriments, vous devez consulter un professionnel de la santé pour obtenir un diagnostic précis. Il pourra vous proposer une stratégie de prise en charge fondée sur des données probantes.
La raison pour laquelle vous devez demander l'aide d'un professionnel est que la prise de suppléments peut être mauvaise pour vous.
Tout d'abord, certaines vitamines, comme les vitamines A, D, E et K, sont liposolubles et sont stockées dans l'organisme. Il est donc possible d'avoir des niveaux trop élevés qui peuvent causer des problèmes. Par exemple, des niveaux trop élevés de vitamine D peuvent provoquer des calculs rénaux, de la constipation et de l'hypertension artérielle. Un excès de vitamine A ou de fer peut endommager le foie et d'autres organes.
Deuxièmement, les nutriments ne doivent pas être considérés comme des composants indépendants. Il faut plutôt les considérer comme des parties d'un tout. De nombreux compléments peuvent interagir négativement avec d'autres compléments et même avec des médicaments. Par exemple, la vitamine K peut réduire la capacité de la warfarine, un anticoagulant, à prévenir les caillots sanguins.
La combinaison de différents compléments peut également conduire à des quantités excessives ou inadéquates de certains nutriments, avec des effets potentiellement néfastes. Par exemple, une supplémentation prolongée en zinc peut entraîner une carence en cuivre, qui a été associée à l'anémie et à une altération des fonctions cérébrales.
Que faire ?
La meilleure façon de s'assurer que votre système immunitaire reçoit ce dont il a besoin est d'adopter un mode de vie sain et équilibré.
Le régime alimentaire est essentiel. Mangez des aliments non transformés, sans conservateurs, et riches en vitamines, minéraux et antioxydants variés. Votre alimentation doit comprendre des légumes verts et jaunes, des fruits et des baies, des céréales complètes, des graines et des noix.
Et ce ne sont pas seulement les composants individuels des aliments qui sont importants. L'interaction entre eux est également importante. C'est quelque chose qui ne peut être reproduit dans un comprimé.
Les facteurs liés au mode de vie sont également essentiels. Le stress est un élément normal et essentiel de la vie, mais il doit être désactivé pour protéger l'organisme. Il est important de trouver des moyens efficaces de contrôler le stress, comme les exercices de respiration, le yoga et la méditation.
Parmi les activités qui se sont avérées bénéfiques pour la santé, citons le fait de se reposer suffisamment, de faire régulièrement de l'exercice, de passer du temps à l'extérieur et de rester en contact avec la société. Le tabagisme et la consommation excessive d'alcool sont clairement nocifs.
Enfin, nous oublions souvent d'être gentils avec nous-mêmes. Lorsque vous êtes malade, prenez le temps de vous rétablir. Lorsque vous traversez une période particulièrement stressante, faites un effort supplémentaire pour vous déstresser.
Mais surtout, ne considérez pas ces mesures comme des mesures d'urgence. Intégrez-les à votre mode de vie. Aussi tentant que cela puisse être, il n'est pas possible de se “supplémenter” pour sortir d'un mauvais style de vie.",Comment améliorer son immunité ? Un expert donne des conseils,Null
"Political actors in Tanzania have in recent years demanded compensation from Germany for colonial atrocities committed in the early 20th century. In early 2017, the National Assembly of Tanzania stopped short of putting the label of genocide on the atrocities committed by German troops during the Maji-Maji uprising (1905–1907).
During a visit to Tanzania recently, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, asked for “forgiveness” and expressed “shame” for the colonial atrocities committed in what was then German East Africa. This was in reference to the killing of up to 300,000 people during the Maji-Maji uprising.
German involvement in Tanzania began in 1890 when Berlin decided to take over administration of east African territories which German traders and travellers had secured. To reduce the cost of administration, governance rested on a few German officers with unchecked power, along with African and Arab fighters (called Askari) to suppress resistance.
Abuse of power was rampant in this system, which provoked rather than prevented resistance. By the end of the 19th century, German troops had brutally quashed an uprising of the Wahehe in southern Tanzania.
In 1905, the Maji-Maji uprising began as a rebellion against Arab traders and cotton plantation owners of the south-eastern coast. Usually the insurgents would first uproot the cotton plants, and then raid farmhouses or office buildings. But the raids transformed into a peasants’ revolt as the violence progressed into the interior.
The German response was brutal and catastrophic (page 265). A three-year-long mass starvation (page 274) devastated a large part of the southern territory. Entire areas were depopulated or ravaged by disease (page 274). In one location, 25% of the women became unable to fall pregnant. As many as 300,000 people were killed.
We are widely published scholars of transitional justice and international criminal justice. Our historical and legal analysis of the suppression of the Maji-Maji uprising shows that there were indeed widespread instances of war crimes committed in the conflicts between the German military and various anti-colonial groups. It also shows that German conduct in that conflict can be described as genocidal in terms of intent and impact.
There is a nuance to our finding. We could not find any genocidal directive from the imperial authorities in Berlin. But the evidence suggests that the atrocities committed against civilians were indeed intended to destroy an identifiable group in whole or in part. This is the core element of the current definition of genocide.
Finding that the violent quashing of the Maji-Maji uprising would be regarded as genocide in the legal sense doesn’t have any practical implications, such as a legal obligation to pay compensation. Today’s international law doesn’t apply to what happened then. The implications are instead political and moral: if Germany’s colonial actions were to be regarded as genocide, the German public might be open to Tanzanian compensation claims, as they were to Namibia’s.
Suppression as genocidal violence
Many of the atrocities committed during this conflict could be construed as war crimes committed by both sides. But our focus was the possibility of a genocide.
A resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1946 noted that, historically,
many instances of such crimes of genocide have occurred when racial, religious, political and other groups have been destroyed, entirely or in part.
This resolution was precursor to the Genocide Convention of 1948. The convention defines the crime of genocide and serves as the basis for the prevention and punishment of genocide as a crime under international and domestic laws.
Under international law, the Genocide Convention and its progeny don’t apply to states or individuals retrospectively. These laws cannot be invoked as a basis for a legal claim against Germany for events that occurred in the early 20th century.
But characterising an atrocity as a genocide can serve as impetus for acknowledgement and some form of voluntary compensation.
The genocide question
We analysed first-hand archival records from Germany and Tanzania to examine whether German actions constitute genocide according to the Genocide Convention or the International Criminal Tribunals’ jurisprudence.
German documents and letters from the time rarely distinguished between ethnic groups and usually referred to “Negroes” (Neger) and “Blacks” (Schwarze) in a sweeping way. Racialisation didn’t indicate victimisation in itself, because some of these populations were regarded as friendly to the German colonial authorities.
One could conclude that the German authorities targeted their political (anti-colonial) opponents rather than a group that’s protected under the current definition of genocide. The protected groups are national, racial, ethnic or religious.
But a more expansive reading of genocide law leads to a different conclusion.
The first genocide conviction delivered by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was in the case of Akayesu. In this case the judges reasoned that the four protected groups should not be seen as inflexible categories. They stretched the limits to accommodate groups that have similar qualities to the groups explicitly protected.
Subsequent decisions by international criminal tribunals followed that reasoning. They took into account the way the perpetrator saw the group. A group protected by the Genocide Convention does not have to exist objectively. It is enough if it exists in the mind of the perpetrator and he wants to destroy it in whole or in part.
The “Blacks” the Germans had in mind when they wrote and spoke about their enemies did not exist as such a group. Instead they consisted of a plethora of ethnic groups, tribes and extended family clans. They had as much in common with each other as the Germans had with their colonising British neighbours in the Uganda protectorate.
But in the German officers’ minds these “Blacks” did exist as such a group. That is why they would have been protected if the Genocide Convention and the respective jurisprudence had been in force then.
This has relevance for the question of whether the German conduct during the Maji-Maji uprising was genocidal.
The lack of genocidal directives doesn’t imply a lack of genocidal intent. Circumstantial evidence suggests the German administration wanted to destroy not only hostile individual members of a racialised group, but the group in whole or in part.
The trial and appeals chambers of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia accepted this kind of reasoning: the basis for establishing a perpetrator’s genocidal intent does not always have to be written evidence or witness testimony. Sometimes the perpetrator’s own behaviour allows such a conclusion.
In Srebrenica it was the policy to separate men from women and children and then to kill the men in mass executions. In a patriarchal society like the Bosnian Muslims’ the whole Muslim group would not survive without its men.
We apply a similar standard to the German conduct to eradicate the traditional leaders of the communities that took part in the Maji-Maji uprising. These communities would have perished without their leaders. In some cases, they did perish. And depriving these groups of their ability to make collective decisions and to “survive as groups” (rather than as individuals or nuclear families) was the explicit aim of the German commanders.","300,000 Tanzanians were killed by Germany during the Maji-Maji uprising – it was genocide and should be called that",politics
"South Africa’s crime statistics for the third quarter of 2023 show that people continue to face a serious problem of violent crime, especially murder and attempted murder. The country’s per capita murder rate for 2022/23 was the highest in 20 years at 45 per 100,000 (a 50% increase compared to 2012/13).
In response to this crisis, the South African Police Service has reconfigured its policing strategies and plans. Yet, these approaches offer very little innovation. They mostly reaffirm the way the police have typically pursued policing for the past three decades – fighting a “war” on crime and “sweeping away” criminals.
In my view the police have adopted unsuitable crime fighting strategies. This is a “war” the police can’t win on their own, because violent crime is a complex phenomenon. It requires whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. Government departments, civil society groups and the private sector should pool resources and work together in a co-ordinated manner. They must be guided by a common plan. Otherwise crime prevention efforts will be piecemeal, lacking effectiveness.
Determinants and complexity of violent crime
The scholarly literature on violent crime in South Africa, including my research, indicates that interpersonal violence is typically the outcome of a combination of risk factors over time.
One of them is the idea that violence is a legitimate means to resolve conflict between people.
Another is childhood experiences of violence.
Socio-economic elements, such as poverty, unemployment and inadequate living conditions, underpin violence, mainly for younger men. Feelings of stress, frustration and humiliation, combined with substance abuse (chiefly alcohol), inequitable gender norms and the availability of weapons, especially firearms, often results in violent behaviour.

Given what studies say about the determinants of violence, I predicted during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 that South Africa would soon face a crime catastrophe. The pandemic and lockdown regulations had increased poverty, unemployment and food insecurity. This would exacerbate existing risk factors for violence, such as:
domestic abuse
learners dropping out of school
diminishing prospects of meaningful jobs, especially for young, marginalised men.
In 2021/22 there was a significant increase in all categories of violent crime.
Since then there’s been no reduction in these risks, especially food insecurity, youth unemployment, child abuse and the school dropout rate. The murder rate per capita has increased from 33.5 per 100,000 during the COVID-19 period (2020/21) to 45 per 100,000 in 2022/23.
Police and the prevention of violent crime
Even though the police are not able to do anything directly about many of the underlying risk factors for violence, studies have shown that specific policing interventions can make a difference in reducing violent crime.
The police can work closely with communities to devise cooperative solutions to crime problems. They can also collect and use relevant intelligence to design and implement evidence-based crime prevention actions. These should focus on the areas where criminal offending is most concentrated, and on the situations that tend to drive that behaviour.
Interventions require a competent, adequately resourced and professional police organisation and a fair and effective criminal justice system.
Since the 1990s the work of the police has included community-oriented approaches. Best practice is for police to treat community safety groups as equal partners. Solutions to crime problems are co-created.
But the police’s approach has been the converse. They have co-opted community safety groups, such as community police forums and neighbourhood watches, to be force multipliers. Studies have shown that such a method is often ineffective.
For the past three decades, South African police have prioritised militarised policing approaches, such as Operation Shanela (“to sweep” in isiZulu). They encourage police to be more forceful in their interactions with alleged criminals.
There is very little evidence to suggest that militarised policing brings down violent crime rates. Instead, it can erode public trust in the police. This is certainly evident in South Africa, where only 27% of the population view the police as trustworthy (from 47% in 1999).
Police effectiveness in combating crime has also been undermined by declining personnel numbers. In 2018, there were 150,639 police personnel, but this is now 140,048. There has also been a substantial decline in the police reserve force.
High levels of crime have placed considerable pressure on the criminal justice system too. Conviction rates for violent crime are very low. For example, between 2019/20 and 2021/22, police recorded 66,486 murder cases. Of these, only 8,103 (12%) resulted in a guilty verdict.
What can be done?
The good news is that the government does not exclusively depend on policing plans to tackle crime. It has also developed multi-departmental and evidence-based strategies and plans to prevent crime. These are derived from Chapter 12 of the National Development Plan. It calls for:
police to be more professional, demilitarised and work in partnership with communities
an improved criminal justice system
an integrated crime prevention strategy.
In 2022 the cabinet approved the Integrated Crime and Violence Prevention Strategy. It seeks to achieve a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach given the multi-dimensional nature of the risk factors that drive violent crime. Furthermore, this strategy encourages government and other elements of society to jointly address common crime problems and collaboratively determine prevention strategies, especially at the community level.
Read more: South Africans are feeling more insecure: do Ramaphosa's plans add up?
There was also the recognition that various government departments (and not just the police) needed to work closely with civil society and the private sector to drive down crime levels.
The problem is that the implementation of strategy is in limbo. No government agency has been willing to take responsibility for it. That’s because there is no direct budgetary allocation, given the highly constrained government purse.
High levels of crime and low levels of policing have substantial negative effects on economic performance. So investing adequate resources to carry out the Integrated Crime and Violence Prevention Strategy will not only reduce violent crime, but also contribute to economic growth.",South Africa’s police are losing the war on crime – here’s how they need to rethink their approach,politics
"November marks a sombre anniversary in Uganda’s recent political history. In 2020, the east African country’s leading opposition politician, Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, was arrested. He was on the campaign trail ahead of the 2021 presidential elections.
Mass demonstrations demanding the release of the popular musician-turned-presidential-candidate broke out in and around the capital, Kampala. Over two days, security agents of the regime of Yoweri Museveni – in power since 1986 – cracked down on the protests.
They fired live ammunition into crowds of protesters, killing at least 54 people and injuring many more. The regime arrested over a thousand people. Hundreds more have since been reported disappeared.
Three years on, the effects of the massacre loom large over Uganda’s contemporary politics.
The Ugandan Human Rights Commission recently announced it was closing the files of 18 opposition supporters who remain missing. This has renewed demands for justice and government accountability in connection with the 2020 killings.
In my research, I have charted Kyagulanyi’s unlikely political rise from his landslide victory as an independent candidate in a 2017 parliamentary by-election to his 2021 run for the presidency against Museveni.
Kyagulanyi and his supporters have been subject to arrest, abduction and unlawful detention. They have been tortured and some have been killed.
Given this history, it’s not surprising that the Kyagulanyi-led opposition party, the National Unity Platform, has been at the centre of calls for justice.
Over the last month, the party has spearheaded a boycott of parliament in protest of the Museveni regime’s worsening human rights violations. The opposition has demanded that the state take full accountability for the November 2020 killings and inform Ugandans of the whereabouts of those who remain missing.
With just a little over two years to the next presidential election in 2026, I trace the fallout from the November 2020 massacre to highlight its implications for both the Museveni regime and the Kyagulanyi-led opposition.
Calls for accountability
The initial impetus for a parliamentary boycott came on Uganda’s independence day on 9 October 2023. This followed security officers storming the National Unity Platform’s headquarters. They broke up a prayer meeting of party leaders and families whose loved ones have either died or been disappeared. In the raid, 14 people were arrested.
In addition to the boycott, the National Unity Platform has released a list of 20 Ugandans who have been disappeared, 19 of them since the November 2020 protests. The party routinely posts briefs of the missing on its social media platforms in commemoration of what it calls “Black November”.
The Museveni regime hasn’t budged. However, this pressure has led to some action. According to the leader of the opposition in parliament, Mathias Mpuuga, the human rights commission has started to re-contact the families of the missing to get statements.
International repercussions
The 2020 killings and subsequent arrests and disappearances have had recent international repercussions. At the end of October 2023, for example, US president Joe Biden announced his intention to end Uganda’s participation in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) trade programme. Agoa gives exports from qualifying African countries duty-free access to the US market.
In justifying this decision, the White House pointed to the Museveni regime’s “gross violations of internationally recognised human rights”.
This official censure was additionally inspired by Uganda’s recently passed anti-homosexuality law. The White House branded it in May 2023 “a tragic violation of universal human rights”.
There had also been earlier warnings from the US Bureau of African Affairs amid rising levels of state repression during the 2021 election campaign. The bureau said
there will be consequences for those who are continuing to undermine democracy (in Uganda).
Museveni is considered one of the United States’ closest and most reliable military allies in Africa. He has been a “donor darling” of the west for decades. In a New York Times op-ed in 2020, Kyagulanyi labelled Museveni “America’s Favorite African Strongman”.
Indeed, despite the Museveni regime’s worsening human rights record, the US has provided Uganda with hundreds of millions of dollars in development and military aid. This has helped fund the Museveni state’s robust militarisation.
Time will tell if the Biden administration’s Agoa decision is anything more than a slap on the wrist. There are certainly reasons to be sceptical that it is. But given that Uganda currently trades approximately US$200 million in exported goods to the US annually, the decision will have real economic impact.
The Museveni succession
So where does all this leave Kyagulanyi’s party, with just over two years until the country’s next presidential election?
Political rumours about a possible Museveni succession are rife. Some suggest that his son is being groomed to be his political heir.
Despite the Ugandan president “officially” turning 80 next year, opposing him presents the opposition with familiar obstacles.
First, they must contend with unceasing state repression. In September 2023, for instance, Kyagulanyi was received warmly by massive crowds during his tour of Uganda to drum up grassroots support. This campaign, however, was cut short by the government, which accused him of using the rallies to “incite violence (and) promote sectarianism”.
Second, since securing a sixth consecutive victory in elections in 2021, Museveni’s government has co-opted, infiltrated and divided the country’s fragmented opposition.
The country’s second-largest opposition party, the Forum for Democratic Change, for instance, has been mired in a political scandal. It’s been alleged that some of its top leadership accepted campaign funds from Museveni to foil a possible electoral alliance with the National Unity Platform in 2021. Kyagulanyi recently conceded that his party isn’t “really safe from Museveni’s infiltration”.
Finally, Museveni’s grip over Uganda’s military remains strong. This means that any transfer of power through electoral means from Museveni to a Kyagulanyi-led opposition seems unlikely – regardless of how Ugandans actually vote in 2026. Indeed, Kyagulanyi has little connection to Uganda’s powerful military establishment.
All this suggests that as Ugandans memorialise a tragic part of their recent past, their post-Museveni political future remains deeply uncertain.",Black November: remembering Uganda’s massacre of the opposition three years on,politics
"It’s more than a year since President William Ruto was sworn into office as Kenya’s fifth president. He assumed power at a time when Kenya was beset by rising food and fuel prices, high unemployment and a worrying debt burden.
During the election campaign, Ruto promised to fix an economy afflicted by corruption and ineptitude. He promised to entrench good governance and place the poor at the centre of economic policy. He pledged to address ethnicised politics and to uphold constitutionalism and the rule of law.
Ruto’s promises were significant. The rule of law and constitutionalism are key to economic planning and development, governance and equitable sharing of national resources. They are the guardrails against impunity, democratic backsliding, lawlessness and political instability. Throughout Kenya’s postcolonial period, the political elite have exploited ethnicity to obtain power at the expense of the collective wellbeing and social cohesion. Elite entitlement has also weakened state institutions, leading to corruption and impunity.
I have studied democratic transitions, conflict and state building and elections in Africa. My 2018 book examined how the political class had exploited ethnicity for political and economic advantage, resulting in weak and even dysfunctional state institutions in Kenya.
In his election campaign Ruto identified the major issues that required urgent attention. He addressed issues that needed swift action without constitutional changes, such as thawing the tension between the executive and the judiciary, decoupling the police finances from the executive, and taking port operations back to the coastal city of Mombasa from the inland town of Naivasha. But resolving Kenya’s economic hardships has proved a hard nut to crack, as his 9 November 2023 state of the nation address acknowledged. Just over a year since he was sworn in, Ruto is no nearer to turning the Kenyan ship around.
Economic turbulence
As a candidate, Ruto portrayed himself as an outsider to Kenya’s power matrix who was best placed to improve the living conditions of the poor and excluded. But the economy has not improved under his watch. If anything, living conditions have worsened.
The cost of living is higher after a steep increase in the petrol price and the local currency’s loss of value. Ruto’s government has imposed new and increased taxes on Kenyans, ostensibly to reduce or remove the need for external borrowing.
Read more: William Ruto is now in charge of Kenya’s shaky economy: where to start
The government was quick to remove fuel and food subsidies, but has been slow to address government wastage.
The government key strategy was to subsidise fertiliser to boost harvests and achieve food security. It remains to be seen whether this will happen. More deliberate measures are required to turn around agriculture as the mainstay of the economy.
On the question of centring the poor and marginalised in governance, Ruto focused on the financial sector. The government rolled out the “Hustler Fund” to make credit more affordable.
But the fund’s impact on overall living standards through job creation, for instance, is likely to be cancelled out by a punitive tax regime and a struggling economy.
Rule of law
Ruto’s first public event as president was to approve the appointment of six judges left in limbo by his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta. He also made good on his promise to allocate more funding to the judiciary.
Read more: William Ruto: how Kenya's new president took on powerful political dynasties
However, to entrench the rule of law and constitutionalism calls for more than this. Judicial officers must act with utmost integrity. To affirm equality before the law, errant senior state officers and the political elite must face the law and if found guilty sanctioned decisively.
The Kenyan judiciary is still bedevilled by corruption that impedes access to justice. Disturbingly, it is seen as more inclined to punishing the poor while letting the rich and political elite act with impunity. Ruto himself has obeyed court rulings that went against him, unlike under Kenyatta, when disregard for the law was the norm. Critics, however, including the Law Society of Kenya, have accused his administration of disobeying court orders like his predecessor.
Ruto spoke out against extrajudicial and summary executions and enforced disappearances perfected by the police over the years. He sought to accord the police financial and operational autonomy. Thus he transferred accounting for the police budget to the police as he had promised.
Despite these changes, a culture of impunity and lack of transparency continues to undermine the Kenyan police. Extrajudicial executions continue. The police must be placed under civilian oversight as envisaged under the constitution.
The failure to set up a commission of inquiry into state capture under his predecessor, as promised during campaigns, dented Ruto’s commitment to the fight against corruption. A year later, a commission of inquiry has not been formed and the issue seems to have been abandoned altogether.
It is unlikely that Ruto will fulfil his manifesto unless he reins in runaway corruption and the culprits are held to account. The rule of law demands that proceeds of crime be recovered and offenders charged for economic sabotage. This approach would obviate the need to burden Kenyans with taxes and more borrowing.
National cohesion
Appointments to government positions have been undermined by the age-old problems of recycling appointees, patronage, nepotismand ethnicity. Just as worrying are senior government officials publicly advancing exclusionary ethnic politics with impunity. Ruto must rein them in.
It is also a setback that Ruto acceded to talks to assuage the opposition elite who had resorted to violent protests against his historic victory. These elitist self-serving talks could lead to constitutional amendments creating more political positions under a cynically flawed logic that this approach enhances national cohesion. This is an about turn on Ruto’s part.
Ultimately national cohesion is Ruto’s pressing challenge. Kenya is divided on many fronts – economic, ethnic, regional and religious – a legacy of previous governments. Ruto needs to look beyond ethno-regional appointments. For legitimacy and transformation, he needs to ideologically reconnect with and dignify the “hustler nation”, the disenfranchised constituency that propelled him into power. Bar this, he could face an intensely contested reelection bid like his predecessors.","William Ruto’s first year: he promised to make life easier for Kenyans, but things got worse",politics
"The Democratic Republic of Congo is expected to hold elections on 20 December 2023. The country’s electoral commission has announced President Felix Tshisekedi will be seeking reelection alongside 23 other candidates. They include Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege and the runner-up in the 2018 presidential election, Martin Fayulu. The courts will confirm the final list of candidates. One key political figure has yet to make his intentions known: Joseph Kabila. He was president for 18 years until Tshisekedi took over in 2019. The DRC’s constitution allows two five-year terms, but he remained in power by delaying elections. He holds substantial political, military and business sway. Jonathan R. Beloff is a political scholar who researches the politics and security of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. We asked him some questions.
What is the Kabila family’s place in the DRC’s politics?
Joseph Kabila was the country’s fourth president. He took office after the assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who was killed by his bodyguard in 2001. Joseph later won presidential elections in 2006 and 2011.
The surprise 2018 election of Felix Tshisekedi, who took power in January 2019, as president interrupted more than two decades of the Kabila family’s rule. At the time, Joseph was constitutionally barred from running for president – and he had already overshot his second term by more than three years.
The Kabila family became a political powerhouse after gaining control in 1996. With the assistance of other countries – such as neighbours Uganda, Angola and Rwanda – the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, under the leadership of Laurent Kabila, overthrew the long-standing Zairian dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. This was during the First Congo War (1996-1997).
Laurent’s tenure was riddled with ineffectiveness and corruption. In less than two years, he had dismissed his minister of defence, the Rwandan James Kabarebe, and begun arming anti-Rwandan forces. These forces contained actors who participated in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.
Laurent claimed his government only backed these forces after Rwanda attempted to overthrow his regime.
The bloody Second Congo War (1998-2003) led to at least two million deaths, many of them from disease and extreme poverty rather than warfare itself. While Kabarebe’s invasion attempt on the capital Kinshasa in 1998 failed, the vast DRC was divided into spheres of influence for different nations and their aligned rebel groups. This status quo only began to break after Laurent’s assassination, which led to the rise of his son Joseph.
Joseph learned military strategy, tactics and politics under Kabarebe. The two worked together after the Second Congo War to flush out many anti-Rwandan forces. This included the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. They also campaigned together during the 2011 presidential elections, which Joseph won.
Joseph initially cast himself as a reformer who would end the Second Congo War and pursue policies to spur political and economic development. However, instability in eastern Congo persisted under his rule, with accusations of massive corruption that undermined the nation’s development.
How much sway does Joseph Kabila hold today?
Joseph Kabila remains a strong presence within Congo’s political, economic and military institutions. He has strong networks developed over 18 years in power. He could use this influence to sway the vote towards any of the candidates.
His influence stems from favourable business and political alliances he created when he was president. Like Mobutu, Kabila used his vast financial resources to secure favourable relationships with Congolese and foreign business leaders. A document leak in 2021 revealed that Kabila received over US$138 million from corruption and bribes.
There were claims that the former president originally convinced Tshisekedi to accept a power-sharing agreement. Under it, Tshisekedi would be president, while Kabila would control political decisions behind the scenes. The near appointment of Ronsard Malonda as the president of the electoral body illustrated Kabila’s political influence. Malonda held senior positions during the country’s 2006, 2011 and 2018 elections. He has been accused of rigging results in favour of Kabila.
Such accusations have benefited Tshisekedi’s election campaign. He is depicting himself as a candidate not tied to the corruption within DRC.
If Kabila does decide to campaign, political dynamics within much of Congo’s civil society, military and economy will be divided. Government ministers and officials will be forced to choose to support either the incumbent or Kabila’s preferred candidate.
What was Tshisekedi expected to change after he routed Joseph Kabila?
There was initial hope that Tshisekedi’s government would foster peace in eastern Congo, establish greater national unity and help solve the nation’s economic woes after decades of corruption and conflict. However, these problems have persisted.
Initially, Amnesty International praised Tshisekedi for pardoning political prisoners and allowing greater public space for criticisms of the Congolese government. He also began investigations on past mineral deals during the Kabila governments. As the African Union chair from 2021 to 2022, he pushed for greater attention to the COVID-19 pandemic and promoted the African Continental Free Trade Area.
Despite initial attempts to foster more significant relations with Rwanda, relations soured in 2022. This was after the Congolese government accused Rwanda of supporting the resurrected M23 rebels.
Rwanda denied the allegations. It has also accused Tshisekedi’s government of being hostile to the Congolese Tutsi population – the Banyamulenge – who are historically related to Rwandans.
The US Department of State has expressed concern about Tshisekedi’s anti-Banyamulenge rhetoric, as well as democratic transparency in the upcoming election.
Tshisekedi’s campaign strategy seems to focus on promoting security in eastern DRC by not only defeating the M23, but also attacking Rwanda for interfering in Congolese affairs. The securitisation of the Banyamulenge and Rwanda – the political manipulation to stir public fear – has helped deflect internal criticisms of the Tshisekedi regime.
Whether the elections take place is another area of concern. There are concerns that Tshisekedi will delay or cancel the election by citing security concerns. If this happens, it might be perceived by domestic and international partners as political interference by the ruling regime.",DRC elections: the Kabila family legacy looms large over the country’s polls,politics
"On his official visit to Kenya, King Charles III acknowledged Britain’s colonial era “wrongdoings”. He also paid tribute to Kenyan soldiers who had participated in the first and second world wars on behalf of Britain. His visit coincided with Kenya’s 60th independence anniversary.
British colonial rule in Kenya was characterised by injustices. Among these were forceful dispossession of indigenous people’s land, torture, detention and brutal suppression of anti-colonial movements.
An excerpt from King Charles’s speech is useful to decipher the value and implications of his apology, from an international law perspective:
The wrongdoings of the past are a cause of the greatest sorrow and the deepest regret. There were abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence committed against Kenyans as they waged, as you said at the United Nations, a painful struggle for independence and sovereignty – and for that, there can be no excuse. In coming back to Kenya, it matters greatly to me that I should deepen my own understanding of these wrongs, and that I meet some of those whose lives and communities were so grievously affected.
The legacy of colonial rule is similarly apparent in other east African contexts. German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier recently extended a similar gesture in Tanzania over the brutal suppression of anti-colonial movements. In 2020, Belgium’s King Philippe expressed regrets about the colonial legacy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Are public acknowledgements like this just symbolic? Or do they have the potential to elicit reparations under international law?
As an academic and practitioner of international law and transitional justice, I have worked (as a visiting professional) in the Office of Public Counsel for Victims at the International Criminal Court.
It is my view that these public acknowledgements of colonial legacy in east Africa by Britain, German and Belgium can be classified under the broad framework of transitional justice, as opposed to mere international relations or politics.
Transitional justice generally implies both the judicial and non-judicial measures aimed at redressing legacies of human rights abuses. It is different from the traditional view on justice as it provides avenues to redress mass atrocity, in this case, colonial legacies. Measures under transitional justice range from the formation of truth commissions to criminal prosecution and reparation programmes. The process of memorialisation through museums and monuments is another important tool in the transitional justice process.
The options
International human rights law provides the standards on transitional justice. It has four pillars: prosecutions, truth telling (truth commissions), reparations and institutional reform.
Truth commissions: These are temporary quasi-judicial inquiries. They are normally commissioned by states to investigate previous wrongdoings and make recommendations.
Belgium, for instance, set up a Special Parliamentary Commission to deal with the country’s colonial legacy. It was the first of its kind in Europe and ended in December 2022. No concrete proposals came out of it. The government did not show serious interest in the work of the commission.
Criminal prosecutions: This is not a real option because colonial crimes are state crimes. The International Criminal Court deals with cases of individuals, not states. And it only considers crimes committed after the Rome Statute came into force, in 2002.
Reparative justice: Apologies and memorials are forms of reparation. But these are incomplete without material aspects like restitution or monetary compensation to a group of victims. International law does not offer specific guidance on reparations for colonial state crimes.
Britain could be guided on reparations by UN’s Articles on responsibility of states (for internationally wrongful acts) adopted by the International Law Commission in 2001. The UN also has a set of basic principles on remedies for victims of human rights violations.
Reparations for state colonial crimes should take full account of individual and collective harm. But this has never been done before.
The governments in the former colonies are politically oriented to maintain friendly bilateral relations with the western powers. Thus the voices of the families of victims of colonial atrocities remain peripheral.
International law and the framework of transitional justice push the envelope beyond symbolism, and offer potential for actual reparations, but also foster reconciliation.
Why it matters
There is a historical background to this admission of guilt and commitment to Kenya. In the past decade, Kenyan groups have filed a series of colonial-era compensation claims in the UK, relating to Britain’s brutal suppression of the Mau Mau insurgency. In 2013, when Kenya was marking its 50th independence anniversary, the UK Foreign Office announced it would be settling claims of Kenyans relating to the Mau Mau events. The British government also promised to fund the construction of a memorial in Nairobi. This was largely a negotiated settlement out of court, and not an outcome of a judicial inquiry.
King Charles III’s recent apology is not an isolated event, but rather a reflection of the progress Kenya has made in seeking redress.",British king acknowledges colonial atrocities in Kenya – here’s what could happen next,politics
"President William Ruto of Kenya recently announced that Kenya’s borders would be open to visitors from the entirety of Africa, with no visas required, by the end of 2023. He said
When people cannot travel, business people cannot travel, entrepreneurs cannot travel, we all become net losers.
A few days later, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda followed suit, saying all Africans would be able to enter Rwanda without visas.
Neither Kenya nor Rwanda will be the first. By the end of 2022, Benin, The Gambia and Seychelles had already implemented a system of visa-free access for all Africans. Perhaps more will follow soon. Some regions, some sub-regional groups and some bilateral arrangements have also resulted in visa-free access and even passport-free access in certain cases.
Within the broader East African Community, Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya allow cross border travel without passports. Botswana and Namibia recently signed a similar agreement.
Despite this progress, by the end of 2022 only 27% of African routes allowed Africans to travel visa-free.
Actions such as those of Kenya and Rwanda take the African Union’s agenda further. Regularising freer movement of people across African borders is one of the continent’s great developmental challenges. It is one of the flagship projects of the African Union’s Agenda 2063.
But even if all African countries no longer required visas from Africans, this would not necessarily give the visitors a right to apply for jobs, establish a business or build a home in the receiving country. The 2018 African Union Free Movement of Persons protocol aims for full free movement, through three phases – entry, residence and establishment. This includes full economic rights, including employment. It has not been widely ratified, however.
Our new study of migration trends underscores the potential contributions of migration to economic development in the countries of origin and destination. This is realised through the transfer of skills, knowledge and remittances. The study also shows that intra-African migration is firmly rooted in geographical, social and economic ties. Movement is predominantly within regions, and moderately between them.
Free trade and movement of people
African Union policies support freer intracontinental trade, investment and movement of people to promote the continent’s economic, social and political development. The continent has made progress on the aspects of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement that deal with trade and investment. There hasn’t been much progress on the free movement of people. And yet the success of the trade agreement requires freer movement of people.
This interdependence between trade and free movement of people was the focus of the recent Pan-African Forum on Migration held in Gaborone, the Botswana capital. The forum brings together African Union member states, the continent’s regional economic communities, UN agencies and intergovernmental organisations to deliberate on migration and human mobility issues in Africa.
Read more: Free movement of people across Africa: regions are showing how it can work
The conference noted that most African countries had failed to ratify the African Union’s Free Movement of Persons protocol. At the same time, there was evidence of improvements in policies and practices at national, bilateral and multilateral levels that facilitate the freer movement of Africans.
Apart from recent announcements by Rwanda and Kenya, other instances would be a growing number of reciprocal arrangements between countries.
Regional migration a norm
The history of African statehood, with strong social ties across national boundaries, makes regional mobility a norm rather than an exception. This can be seen from the migration routes, mostly found within the same regions and which proceed in both directions.
For example, Burkina Faso to Côte d’Ivoire is the largest migrant route in the continent and within the Economic Community of West Africa (Ecowas) – the economic bloc of 15 west African states. Côte d’Ivoire to Burkina Faso is equally popular. This trend is ubiquitous throughout the continent, except within the Southern African Development Community region, where most migrant routes tend to lead to South Africa.
Among the major regional economic communities, Ecowas has the most intense regional migration. It is followed by the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community. By contrast, Ecowas has the least inter-regional migration while the East African Community has the most.
Variations in development across Africa mean that some countries experience contrasting patterns, particularly in extra-continental migration. While most African migrants migrate to and from other parts of the continent, in middle income countries such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria extra-continental emigration is greater.
Immigration and emigration are generally low in low income countries and higher in middle income countries. In rich countries, people tend not to emigrate. The relatively low level of migration in Africa follows this pattern.
Only 14% of total world emigrants come from Africa. The average migrant density, or percentage of migrants living on the continent, is 1.89% compared to a global average of 3.6% where Europe and North America are at 12% and 16% respectively. African migration is thus not only comparatively low compared with the global averages, but characteristically depicts low income.
High income countries tend to have more immigrants than emigrants. The converse is true for low income regions. Africa as a whole has more emigrants than immigrants, confirming the link between migration and development.
Legal restrictions matter little
Much migration in Africa is impervious to legal constrictions or definitions of national boundaries, and even to logistical constraints. Government dictates succeed in making much of this migration irregular but fail to stop it. Though regional integration and liberalisation of migration rules are helpful, they do not yet solve this challenge.
The main migrant sending country to Kenya is Somalia, despite not being in the same regional economic community. And despite efforts by the government of Kenya to deter Somali migrants to Kenya. The main destination country for Nigerian emigrants in Africa is Cameroon, even though it does not belong to Ecowas.
While African migration governance reforms are making considerable progress it will still be a while till they catch up and are able to deal fairly and rationally with the reality of migration patterns in Africa.

"Madagascar is set to elect its president on 16 November 2023, for the next five years.
There’s a lot at stake. I’ve studied Madagascar’s politics – focusing on democratisation and political transitions – and believe that this election is crucial for the consolidation, or deepening, of democracy.
Democratic consolidation is vital. It fosters political stability, protects individual rights, and ensures that power is exercised by elected representatives who are accountable to the people.
Madagascar has, over the past couple of decades, struggled to consolidate its democracy. The so-called 2009 coup d'état – in which the military transferred power to Andry Rajoelina – reverted governance to an outright autocracy. Madagascar eventually returned to electoral politics in 2013 and is now considered a “partly free country”, or “hybrid regime”.
American political scientist Samuel P Huntington argues that two consecutive peaceful transfers of power are the most important measure of democratic consolidation. I share this view.
If this election is successful it would be the second peaceful transfer of power since the 2009 coup d'état. The first peaceful transfer of power occurred in 2019, when Hery Rajaonarimampianina (2014 to 2018), handed power to Rajoelina after a bitterly contested election.
The election is also important for the improvement of the economic and social conditions of Madagascar’s population. Today, the large island nation is ranked among the poorest countries in the world.
If the country fails to have a successful power transition, and is engulfed in another political crisis (maybe even a civil war), the situation will get worse.
It would also mean another lengthy process of transition. A new constitution and electoral law would have to be drafted and ratified, and a government of consensus set up before another presidential election could be held. In other words, the process of democratisation would have to be restarted, just like in 2009-2013.
Uncertainty ahead
Thirteen candidates are running, including the incumbent president Rajoelina. Rajoelina has held this office twice, as the president of the High Transitional Authority of Madagascar (2009–2014) and president (2019-2023). He resigned in September as the constitution requires that the incumbent president transfer power to the president of the Senate if they run for reelection.
The election has gotten off to a rocky start.
Eleven opposition candidates (now 10) – who call themselves the “Collectif des Candidats” (group or coalition of the candidates) – have been protesting against the election’s organisation.
They demand the disqualification of Rajoelina as a candidate due to his acquisition of French citizenship in 2014. Only Malagasy citizens can run for office. And, according to Article 42 of the 1960 law on citizenship, an adult loses Malagasy citizenship if they voluntarily acquire a foreign citizenship.
Madagascar’s Ministry of Justice and High Constitutional Court dismissed this demand, refusing to declare Rajoelina’s candidacy void over his dual nationality.
The Collectif des Candidats also call for the reshuffling (if not replacement) of the Independent National Electoral Commission, the High Constitutional Court, and the current government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Christian Ntsay. They make these demands because they believe that these institutions are biased towards supporting Rajoelina.
Finally, they want a negotiation involving all political parties to resolve these issues before 16 November.
Demands unlikely to be met
The Collectif des Candidats started mass street protests on 2 October. They’ve generally been peaceful, but the authorities have used all means, including violence, to suppress them. The coalition aims to continue these protests until its demands are met. But it doesn’t look like they will be.
For one, forcing Rajoelina to participate in a negotiation that would result in his own disqualification as a candidate is not likely to happen.
Secondly, it’s unlikely that the current government, electoral commission and constitutional court will enter into negotiations regarding their reshuffle or dissolution.
My concern is that the only likely situation for the Collectif’s demands be met would be another severe political crisis. This could necessitate the involvement of the international community – including regional institutions such as the Southern African Development Community and the African Union – to mediate the conflict and lead the country out of crisis. This is what happened during the 2009-2013 transition.
Meanwhile, Rajoelina and the other two presidential candidates – Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko and Sendrison Raderanirina – have continued with their electoral campaigns.
Free and fair election?
Because of all these tensions, there are doubts over whether the presidential election will go ahead on 16 November. There are concerns that the tensions between the two camps could escalate.
I believe that one thing is certain: the current government, electoral commission and high court are, to an extent, supporting their former boss, Rajoelina. It’s in his interests for the election to go ahead.
Another critical question is whether this election will be considered “free and fair” and the results accepted by all.
As Winston Churchill said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.” This is not to mean that democracy is a bad system of government, but only that it is a complex system which is difficult to manage.
Nevertheless, the alternatives to democracy can be far worse. And so all eyes are on the elections, with the hope that Madagascar can peacefully pass this test.

"The relationship between Ghanaian citizens and officers of its police service is a tenuous one. Recent reports by the research network Afrobarometer show a decline in trust between citizens and officers amid complaints of harassment and bribery. There have also been accusations of the police being used by the political hierarchy to stifle dissent by force during protests. The Conversation’s Godfred Akoto Boafo speaks to criminologist Justice Tankebe about the reasons behind the breakdown in trust and ways to improve it.
Do Ghana’s police serve the interests of citizens?
We can think of these interests in terms of people’s expectations of policing. My research has identified four dimensions of these interests.
First is the effective use of police authority to protect citizens from violence and threats to their constitutional rights. Fear of crime is a reasonable indication of police effectiveness. Data from Afrobarometer shows that, in 2002, 16.8% of Ghanaians feared becoming victims of crime at their homes. This declined to 9.2% in 2012 but has now risen to 24.6%.
The second dimension is lawful police conduct. Police officers do not serve this interest when they engage in illegal practices such as robbery, unlawful killing of civilians or bribery. A recent survey funded by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime showed that 53.2% of Ghanaians who interacted with police officers paid them a bribe.
Thirdly, policing serves the interests of Ghanaians when it treats people equally. Simply put, people’s social class, ethnicity, religious beliefs, or political affiliation should not influence the decisions of police officers.
Finally, policing must listen to citizens, explain decisions to them, treat them with respect and care for their wellbeing. Fair treatment communicates symbolic messages about a person’s social standing and inclusion; hence it matters greatly to citizens. A survey of Ghanaians shows a little over half of them think the police treat them fairly.
Why are the police struggling to serve Ghanaians?
The first reason is the colonial roots of the Ghanaian police, which continue to show in three ways:
police officers expect people to accept decisions without question
officers are subservient to elites, who have undue influence on police work
the police are not sufficiently accountable to local communities.
Some officers try to curry favour with politicians in the hope of future advantages such as promotions. This is exemplified in the leaked audio of an alleged plot to replace Ghana’s police chief, which is now the subject of a parliamentary investigation.
Beyond the colonial legacy, political interference means there’s a risk of unsuitable people being recruited to the police. They may lack the appropriate motivation and ethical inclination. The adequacy of training and the quality of supervision are also doubtful. The absence of credible accountability structures also limits scrutiny of how officers behave.
Finally, the behaviours that supervisors model to frontline officers can affect how they interact with citizens. For example, a survey found that officers who felt their superiors treated them with disrespect and partiality were less committed to fair treatment of the public.
What are the consequences for democracy?
Police scholar David Bayley has argued that the quality of policing is an important measure of democratic governance. A country cannot claim to be democratic if the police arbitrarily arrest people, humiliate them, suppress political dissent, and exceed their legal mandate.
When citizens lose faith in democracy, they become tolerant of military interventions. So efforts at democratic consolidation must pay attention to the state of the police. Indeed, some scholars argue that this may help save democracy from the threat of the military taking control.
This matters greatly in a sub-region of increasing political instability and terrorism threat.
What reforms are required?
First, there is a need for ideological re-orientation. The Ghana police say their mandate is to “prevent and detect crime, to apprehend offenders and to maintain public order and safety of persons and properties”. This is indistinguishable from their colonial mandate. Unsurprisingly, police tactics are militaristic and prioritise order over the democratic rights of citizens.
A democratically oriented police service would view its mandate as creating conditions for citizens to enjoy their constitutional rights. It would ask: “how can we facilitate protests and protect protesters?” rather than “what reasons can we find to prevent a protest?”.
The second area for reform is police accountability. Ghanaians have limited information about the internal accountability mechanisms, such as what happens to complaints filed against police officers. Research evidence shows the lack of appropriate signals from the Ghana Police Service deters officers from reporting unethical colleagues.
As I have previously argued, the Ghana Police Service needs independent democratic oversight.
Thirdly, reforms are required to insulate the police from political capture. Ghana’s constitution grants the president the right to appoint the police chief. The president also effectively controls the promotion of senior officers through the police council. The same processes as those used in recruitment into civil service should be considered. Yet this is unlikely to make a difference unless police officers are fully committed to their democratic mandate. They must maintain ethical relationships with politicians and other elites who seek to capture the state for their personal interests.
Finally, there is a need to develop a culture of evidence-based policing. This requires a closer relationship between the police and academics who have the methodological tools to support the police in evaluating the effects of their interventions.",Ghanaians don’t trust the police.

"King Charles’ visit to Kenya this week is the British monarch’s first to a Commonwealth nation since his coronation in September 2022. The visit comes during the country’s 60th anniversary of independence from Britain.
By choosing Kenya, the British government and monarchy seek to highlight the importance they attribute to the east African nation. It also shows other Commonwealth members that it’s possible for a republic to have a positive relationship with Britain. Some Commonwealth states like Jamaica are contemplating removing the king as head of state.
King Charles’ visit is meant to celebrate the warm relationship between the two countries. It will also acknowledge the more painful aspects of the UK and Kenya’s shared history.
The relationship with Kenya remains one of Britain’s more positive post-colonial relationships. However, there have been calls for Britain to apologise and make reparations for its brutal suppression of freedom fighters. People in Kenya, Britain and other former colonies will be watching closely to see what the king has to say.
I’m a historian who has studied and written about the political relationship between Britain and Kenya in the decades after independence. In my view, the relationship has taken a positive tilt since independence for three reasons. These are: the choices of Kenya’s first independent president; diplomatic, economic and ideological alignments; and military ties.
Kenya and Britain’s history
Kenya became a British colony in the late 19th century. A small minority of white British settlers held almost all of the political and economic power. The British government planned to make Kenya a “multi-racial” state. The small white European and Asian populations of 55,700 and 176,600 people, respectively, would have equal or more power than the black majority of 8.3 million. Only in 1960 did the British government accept that Kenya should have majority rule and independence.
Independence celebrations in 1963 were preceded by a difficult period of negotiation and violence. A state of emergency was declared in 1952 in response to the Mau Mau uprising. This was an armed rebellion among one of Kenya’s major tribes, the Kikuyu, fighting for land and freedom.
The emergency lasted until 1960. Over this period, thousands of Kenyans were killed, and tens of thousands were detained in camps without trial. The camps became sites of violence and abuse.
With this past, a close post-colonial relationship between Kenya and Britain can appear surprising. It was expected that Kenya would turn away from Britain and towards other international partners, such as the US or the Soviet Union.
Instead, the relationship has largely been close and friendly, with trade benefits, alignment on significant issues and strong military ties.
Positive relations
Kenya’s first president, Jomo Kenyatta, had been imprisoned by Britain as a leader of the Mau Mau. But once he took leadership, he opted to work primarily with Britain.
Kenyatta saw the benefits he could get from this relationship. These included financial and military backing during the Cold War, and personal backing. In 1965, Britain made plans to protect Kenyatta if a coup was attempted.
British officials were surprised but pleased by Kenyatta’s position. They had many interests in Kenya, ranging from trade to diplomacy. One key interest was Kenya’s white European and Asian populations who held British passports. To help achieve their security, the British government financed the purchase of their land, which could then be sold to Kenyans. Before independence, many in Kenya had hoped for land redistribution. Instead, European settlers got financial benefits.
For decades after independence, Britain was Kenya’s primary economic partner. Currently, Britain is the largest European investor in Kenya and Kenya’s second-largest export destination. There are more than 200 British businesses operating in Kenya.
The British and Kenyan governments have broadly aligned on international diplomatic issues like the Cold War, and later the “war on terror”. There were some exceptions, and the Kenyan government did criticise British policies towards white rule in Rhodesia and apartheid in South Africa. But in private the relationship remained cordial.
Military connections
Military ties have been especially close. Britain remains a training partner. The royal visit includes meeting Kenyan marines trained by British marines.
Britain has also sold arms to Kenya and provided support to set up a navy and air force after independence.
After independence, many African countries expelled their British military commanders to replace them with Africans. Kenya under Jomo Kenyatta chose to keep British commanders. The Kenyan army was led by a British officer until 1966, the navy until 1972 and the air force until 1973.
Most important for Britain is that its military is allowed to train in Kenya. This allows them to practise in different and difficult terrains.
Closeness despite challenges
The relationship between the two nations since independence has not always been smooth, however.
In 1967-68, Kenya increased policies that discriminated against Kenyan Asians. The 1967 Immigration Act and 1968 Trade Licensing Act, for instance, meant non-citizens (including many Asians) needed work permits. This led to the immigration to Britain of 13,600 east African Asians in 1967.
The British government then passed legislation to limit their right to enter the UK despite their holding British passports.
After Ugandan president Idi Amin expelled the Asian population in 1972 – about 40,000 Asian Ugandans moved to the UK – Britain offered aid to Kenya to ensure it didn’t follow a similar policy.
In 1982, after the Kenya Air Force attempted a coup, many in Kenya’s elite became suspicious of Britain’s aims in the country.
Since independence, some in Kenya have questioned why British troops still train in the country. The killing in 2012 of a Kenyan woman, Agnes Wanjiru, seemingly by British soldiers, exacerbated these grumblings.
The issue of the Mau Mau has also been a source of recent tension.
Kenya has repeatedly asked for archive files related to the Mau Mau, which the British government denied having. These files were only acknowledged and released after 2011.
In 2013, the British government finally acknowledged that the government had known about and been complicit in torture and violence during the emergency, and victims would be paid compensation of £19.9 million. The then foreign secretary William Hague stated:
The British government sincerely regrets that these abuses took place.
Pushing forward
Despite moments of tension, the two governments have always sought to dispel difficulties. The king’s visit, for instance, is on the invitation of Kenya’s president William Ruto. Ruto made his first overseas visit as president to the UK for Queen Elizabeth’s funeral in September 2022.
Over six decades, the challenges that have arisen have not been enough to derail the relationship.","King Charles in Kenya: despite past tensions, the visit is a sign of a strong relationship with Britain",politics
"The World Bank issued a statement on 8 August 2023, announcing that it had effectively suspended all new public financing to Uganda over concerns with the country’s anti-homosexuality law, which “fundamentally contradicts the World Bank Group’s values”.
According to Human Rights Watch, the anti-homosexuality act violates multiple fundamental rights guaranteed under Uganda’s constitution and a number of international human rights agreements which the government of Uganda has signed. The act was first proposed in March 2023, and adopted by the Ugandan parliament in early May.
The World Bank, and the diplomatic and donor community writ large, follow closely what happens in Ugandan politics.
It took three months for the bank to react and issue the statement. This was fairly fast. The World Bank is usually a slow mover because of its due diligence bureaucracy. It takes time to have members on board behind political statements. So, because it took only three months, one could argue there was an internal push from central people or member states. This says something about the bank’s ambiguous relationship to its client states’ domestic politics and how it deals with political concerns.
The World Bank has an apolitical mandate. Article IV (section 10) of the Bank’s articles of agreement says
the Bank and its officers shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned.
On the other hand, its mission statement “to end extreme poverty and promote prosperity in a sustainable way” is not only political but requires political action.
As a social anthropologist, I have researched international aid in eastern Africa and particularly followed the relationship between the World Bank and Uganda since 2006.
The World Bank’s engagement with Uganda has always filtered through into the country’s domestic affairs. In my view, the recent suspension of funding over the anti-homosexuality law was in keeping with that tradition. The previous interventions in domestic issues involved presidential term limits, market reforms and governance reforms.
I believe the interventions should be viewed in the context of informal and indirect means through which the World Bank seeks to control its clients. Despite its insistence on national ownership of its projects, the World Bank uses its lending portfolio to govern and control its clients.
Presidential term limits
In 2005/6, the World Bank cut its loans to Uganda by 10% due to technical issues referred to as “prior actions” which the government had failed to implement before signing the loan agreement, causing expenditure overruns in the public administration budget. The real reason for cutting aid, in my opinion, was politics. The World Bank was frustrated when President Yoweri Museveni lifted the presidential term limit to seek re-election again.
The recent reaction to the anti-homosexuality act thus demonstrates a continuity in how the World Bank responds to domestic political affairs. It also shows a change, as the reaction is not rooted in politics or concealed as a form of techno-bureaucracy, but explicitly linked to values. The tone is different. The World Bank always sought to appear neutral on values. It suggests to me that the institution’s most prominent owners and shareholders have weighed in.
Market reforms
During the structural adjustment era, lasting until around 2000, World Bank loans to Uganda and other recipients came with strict conditions and ready-made policies baked into them. The bank could make loans conditional on the recipient state privatising state-owned enterprises or liberalising the economy. Those are highly political and ideological measures in the client state’s sovereign domain. For instance, Museveni bought into a lot of the structural reform programmes which included market reforms and power sector development. This is in contrast to Ethiopia, which until very recently has been considered more resistant to World Bank proposed reforms.
A later disbursement tactic was to make concessional lending contingent on the government making its own national poverty reduction strategy. Once that was endorsed by the bank, the bank would provide financial assistance to help the government implement its own strategy. This bypassed questions about external governance and policy imposition.
Governance reforms
As the World Bank withdrew from direct control, it aimed to retain power through other means – while respecting national ownership. Whatever is proposed by aid recipients still needs the bank’s endorsement to become effective.
The World Bank’s power and control don’t just lie in the ability to decide what to fund and when to stop funding. It is just as much a result of the bank’s ability to frame partnership and the conditions under which the recipient exercises the freedom it has been granted.
One of these freedoms concerns the formulation of national development policy. National policy needs the bank’s approval to become effective. So the client government should do as the bank wants it to do, but voluntarily.
The bank can govern at a distance. The policies funded by the bank are defined as the state’s own polices.
The World Bank, and indeed donors in general, always emphasise the principle of national ownership, even as their policies undermine it. This gives donors the advantage of placing the responsibility for failure on their clients if aid programmes do not succeed. And indirect governance structures imply that client governments appear both as objects to be shaped by donor policies and as subjects with whom agreements are made.
What next
How the World Bank governs and relates to its clients (not just in Uganda) has changed over time, from direct power and policy imposition to more indirect and tacit dynamics concealed as mutual partnership.
The fact that the Ugandan government went on to adopt the anti-homosexuality bill, despite the bank’s indirect governance and technocratic micromanagement, can thus be read as a failure of the partnership arrangement and the bank’s ability to govern at a distance.
Nor did lobbying and arm-twisting by international donors, the US and the EU among others, persuade the government to kill the bill.
More actors and emerging economies are becoming increasingly active as sources of financing, such as China, the Gulf states, Russia, and private actors. These are potentially replacing traditional western donors, marking a shift to more geopolitical rivalry on the African continent. But few lunches are free, and the new, emerging actors pose new conditions and expectations. The World Bank, given its commitment to transparency and democracy, may after all be preferable.
A return to more direct, conditionality-based governance, as practised during the structural adjustment era, could be a way to deal with values, but could jeopardise national ownership and mutual partnership.",World Bank suspension of Uganda funds over anti-homosexuality law: what this says about the struggle over funds and sovereignty,politics
"Many analysts blame state capture – the corruption of the management of public affairs – for the weakening of state capacity in South Africa. A judicial commission of inquiry into the problem laid it bare.
They say the COVID pandemic worsened the situation as public resources had to be redirected from developmental commitments to address the emergency.
The claim has merit. But it ignores the role played by a public administration education that is not fit for purpose. The universities responsible for producing the human capital needed for building state capacity must shoulder much of the blame.
Our experience in public administration in academia and government spans decades. We have wrestled with the question of why, after various policy and administrative reforms in post-colonial Africa, state capability continues to be a challenge for many countries.
In our view the biggest problem facing South Africa is that the training of current and future civil servants is not delivering what the country needs. That’s because the training:
lacks the interdisciplinary approach needed to meet the country’s complex challenges
fails to grasp that technology will play a far greater role in the future
remains trapped in colonial theorisations.
We say this taking our cue from business administration education.
Self reflection
After the 2008 global financial meltdown, British journalist Philip Delves Broughton published an article in The Times, arguing that some Harvard-trained MBA graduates had played a leading role in creating the crisis.
The dean of the Harvard Business School subsequently called for “great introspection”. Harvard’s courage in dealing with the question of its business education is an inspiring lesson on how to confront the flaws of teaching for other fields.

Likewise, almost 15 years later, the South African Association of Public Administration and Management (SAAPAM) raised the issue of public administration education at its recent 22nd Annual Conference. It asked: what do the schools and departments of public administration in South Africa teach?
This question is important because the quality of available talent determines what the state is capable of.
Worrying trends in the teaching of public administration
If public administration education is designed and delivered poorly, it sets a course for the systematic destruction of state capability. In many ways, this is what’s happening in South Africa.
Our analyses indicate that much of what is taught in public administration is not what the country needs to become a capable and developmental state. The discipline is tangled up in its own “self-interpretive closet”. This is despite the trend towards interdisciplinarity, where ideas and methods from different fields of study enrich each other to make sense of societal complexities and find solutions.
Public administration education does not appreciate the imperative of socioeconomic transformation for social and ecological justice, or the role of technology. It remains trapped in colonial teaching about systems and processes.
The “grand narrative fiction”, to borrow New Mexico State University professor David Boje’s phrase, that shaped curriculum development is that government should be run like a business. This is contrary to the constitutional principle that public administration must have a developmental orientation.
In the 1980s, “New Public Management” become a staple diet pushed down the throats of students of public administration. It emphasised the economic value of efficiency and maximisation of output with minimum input costs. The citizens are customers.
The falsehood that government is like a business opened the way to governance by consultants. This, despite the notoriety of “corporate consigliere[s]” deluding managers with
management gibberish and glossy charts while gorging on fat fees.
They hollowed out the capacity of the state. All this occurred because of the void in the teaching of public administration.
But what must be done
The teaching of public administration must respond innovatively to the task of building a capable and developmental state. The way to do this may lie in forging strategic partnerships between academia, professional associations and government. It must aim to improve the talent pipeline for the state.
Universities are the citadel of originating ideas. Professional associations exist to inculcate a culture of professionalism that many lament is lacking in the management of state affairs.
Any effort towards human capital formation needs to start by creating an opportunity for these partnerships to evolve. Universities must shake off their autonomous posture and “ivory towering”.

Government must outgrow its suspicion of universities and embrace evidence-driven policy practices.
Professional associations in the public sector should understand that they exist to pursue the public interest, not to create an elite class in the bureaucracy.
For far too long, collaborative efforts in the teaching of public administration have been a cursory pursuit bereft of strategic intent. This needs to change. They must be institutionalised.
The partnership we are calling for is not only for training interventions. It is also for re-imagining public administration education to be relevant to what the country needs. This must be grounded in the African philosophy of humanism, if the “people first” approach to statecraft is to have meaning. In other words, students of public administration need to be steeped in the orientation that managing state affairs is about giving democracy a human face.
Theories of the state and citizenship, and the principles of democracy, need to underpin the teaching of public administration too. Students must learn how to provide the public good in a way that creates a public value to satisfy public interests. And public administration as practical science must respond to the impediments to human progress in the 21st century: terrorism, global warming, an increasingly unstable global economy, and pandemics.

"Governments around the world use surveillance technology to monitor external threats to national security. Some African governments are also spending vast sums on mass surveillance of their own citizens.
They are using mobile phone spyware, internet interception devices, social media monitoring and biometric identity systems. Artificial intelligence for facial recognition and car number plate recognition is another digital surveillance technology in their growing toolkit.
I recently led research which found that governments in Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco, Malawi and Zambia were collectively spending over US$1 billion a year on these digital surveillance technologies, supplied by companies in the US, the UK, China, the EU and Israel. These are enormous amounts of public expenditure in countries where public services such as education and healthcare are under-funded.
The research also uncovered the harms that this digital surveillance causes.
We found that states were using surveillance technology contracts to spy on opposition politicians, journalists and peaceful activists. They were singling them out for harassment, arrest and even torture. This is in violation of countries’ constitutions, international human rights law and domestic laws. All the five countries studied have signed international conventions on the right to privacy and have incorporated privacy rights into domestic constitutions and national laws.
Our findings give cause for concern about the chilling effect of mass surveillance on citizens’ freedom of speech, stifling debate, closing civic space, and damaging democracy. The report documents the use of surveillance to monitor, arrest and threaten journalists and peaceful activists who criticise government policies or ministers.
The study
We examined over 2,400 database records of contracts for the supply of surveillance technologies for the five countries. Ten countries were originally selected for this study to represent Africa’s main regions and economies. However, we were forced to discontinue research in Egypt, Ethiopia, Algeria and Tunisia due to security risks for the researchers. The author of the Côte d'Ivoire report had to withdraw for unrelated personal reasons.
This study covers only 10% of the countries in Africa, so the total expenditure on surveillance technologies is certainly much higher.
Despite these limitations, our report provides the most detail to date on the size of the market. It also details companies and countries supplying the surveillance technologies.
According to the evidence available to us, Nigeria has procured more than any other country on the continent. The government is a customer of nearly every major surveillance technology company that we examined. It spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually, and at least US$2.7 billion on known contracts between 2013 and 2022. This is the equivalent of $12 per Nigerian citizen.
However, this is only a fraction of the true total as the monetary value of many known contracts is not public knowledge and many contracts are not in the public domain at all.

The findings
We found that different African countries had distinct surveillance profiles.
Morocco has been an avid consumer of internet and mobile phone interception technologies. It has even conducted mobile surveillance of its own king. Ghana focuses on mobile phone spyware and on surveillance of public space. It spent over US$250 million between 2018 and 2021 on a “safe city” project. This involved over 8,400 CCTV cameras on streets, equipped with facial recognition technology and streaming information to a national surveillance data centre with equipment from Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE.
Zambia has also made a huge investment in a safe city surveillance system. In Nigeria, facial and car number plate recognition is used across Lagos and Abuja. Malawi’s investment in surveillance systems is comparatively modest; so far it has rejected the safe city surveillance package being rolled out across Africa by Chinese companies.
Human rights cost
Beyond the financial cost, the widespread use of digital surveillance products has taken a toll on human rights. It has caused long-term physical and psychological harm to individuals unjustly targeted by surveillance tech and held without trial or even tortured by authorities, as documented in the report by the “surveillance stories” case studies from each country.
Journalists and activists, or regular citizens, have been tracked, arrested and detained just for posting a critical message on social media. Under the pretext of national security, governments have exceeded their legal powers of surveillance. They have done so with impunity. As our reports document, even when courts find that security agencies have exceeded their legal power, nobody has been prosecuted or even demoted.
The few rules of surveillance supply that are in place are not being followed. For instance Frontex, headquartered in Warsaw, Poland, and the European External Action Service, the EU’s diplomatic agency, are being investigated by the European Ombudsman over failures to conduct human rights assessments of their surveillance technology transfers to non-EU countries. Self-policing of companies has proved inadequate in preventing violation of human rights.
Surveillance is a violation of the right to privacy of communication and correspondence. Privacy is important in its own right. It is also important in making possible free trade, freedom of expression and open democracy.

What to do about it
Our study points to an urgent need for international governance in the absence of effective national checks for the use of artificial intelligence in surveillance. Authoritarian governments could misuse it to violate privacy and repress peaceful opposition.
On the supply side there’s a need for robust legal frameworks to abolish the export of surveillance technologies used to violate human rights. Companies supplying these to known human rights abusers should be sanctioned, as is the case with companies that breach legal controls on the export of weapons and munitions.
On the demand side the public needs to be more aware of their privacy rights and of the expansion of mass surveillance. Civil society has a role to play in getting the courts to protect their rights and freedoms.
Public expenditure on surveillance should be defunded and the money redirected to productive social services such as education and health. The goal should be the abolition of all rights-violating surveillance technologies.",Some African governments are spending millions to spy on their citizens – stifling debate and damaging democracy,science + tech
"On 16 September 2023 in Bamako, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger established the Alliance of Sahel States, a mutual defence pact. The agreement was signed against the backdrop of an ongoing political crisis in Niger following a coup on 26 July 2023. The regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), threatened military intervention.
The leaders of the three countries signed the Liptako-Gourma charter, named after the Liptako-Gourma region, which straddles the three countries and is at the heart of security concerns in the central Sahel.
The alliance was set up to help counter possible threats of armed rebellion or external aggression. According to the member states:
any attack against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of one or more contracting parties will be considered as aggression against the other parties.
However, the different bodies and mechanisms of the alliance have yet to be created.
The Sahel region has been facing a jihadist insurgency since the early 2000s. This situation has triggered many other conflicts in the region – war in Mali and insurgency in Burkina Faso. The member states of the military alliance have experienced military coups in recent years, leading to a deterioration of their relations with the rest of Ecowas and the international community.
They have all hosted troops from the former colonial power, France, on their soil.
The alliance was created while Ecowas was threatening to intervene militarily in Niger to help restore constitutional order following the coup d'état led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani. Its formation, however, raises a number of questions.
Our research focuses on security issues in the Sahel. In this article, we analyse the reasons for the creation of this alliance, its likely implications for regional cooperation and its chances of success.
A desire for regional solidarity
For more than a decade, the fight against insecurity in the Sahel was led by France, as the coordinator of local and international interventions. This changed with the withdrawal from Mali of the French military from Operation Barkhane in 2022 and the departure of France’s Operation Sabre from Burkina Faso in 2023.
The new pact reflects a desire to break with the way terrorism and organised crime have been combated. For example, the perceived ineffectiveness of the G5 Sahel Joint Force and Operation Barkhane contributed to Mali’s decision to seek other partners such as Russia.
The resurgence of insecurity in the Sahel, however, shows that, in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, will and solidarity are not enough. Liptako-Gourma, a vast region of 370,000km² and home to 45% of the total population of the three states, has been experiencing a serious security crisis. This is due to the presence of armed groups who are taking advantage of the withdrawal of Barkhane.
By February 2023, the number of deaths linked to political violence had increased by 77% in Burkina Faso and 150% in Mali compared with 2021. Burkina Faso is now the country with the highest number of victims of acts of terrorism in the world, ahead of Afghanistan.
Constraints on cooperation
The Alliance of Sahel States has been created at a time when regional and international cooperation in the Sahel is struggling. The G5 Sahel Joint Force, which raised a lot of hopes when it was launched in 2017, has been on the brink of collapse since Mali withdrew in 2022. Cooperation with European partners has been hampered by a succession of events and decisions. These include the denunciation by Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger of several defence agreements with Paris and the withdrawal of French troops.
Although some partners, such as the United States, maintain a presence in the Sahel, these changes have put constraints on the cooperation dynamic that has existed in the region for almost 20 years.
Ecowas has not yet committed resources to the fight against terrorism in the Sahel. The organisation has been very active in resolving political crises linked to coups in the region, but has not succeeded in encouraging transitions to civilian power.
Ecowas’ threats to intervene militarily in Niger played a role in the creation of the new alliance.
What will be the relationship between the Alliance of Sahel States and Ecowas? It is still too early to say. The same applies to the relationship between the alliance and other initiatives such as the G5 Sahel Joint Force and the Accra Initiative. For now, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger are in a political stalemate with Ecowas on multiple fronts.
Lack of aerial resources
The Sahel States Alliance appears to be an extension of an effort by the three countries to make the fight against terrorism their own. The resurgence of insecurity in the Sahel shows, however, that in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the desire to be autonomous is not enough.
The members of the new alliance are committed to financing the initiative through their own contributions. However, given their limited capacities, it is unlikely that they will be able to carry out the financially intensive war on terrorism on their own.
Their armed forces also have major capacity weaknesses. Chief among them is a shortage of air assets. The army personnel with whom we spoke during our interviews in the Sahel are convinced that their defence and security forces could fight terrorism effectively if they had significant air capability.
Through this new pact, the member countries are banking on the military approach. However, the fight against security threats does not depend only on military means. Experience in the Sahel has shown that a security-based approach tends to encourage escalation and violence against civilians.
Admittedly, through the Sahel Alliance – not be confused with Alliance of Sahel States – the European Union and other partners have, in addition to military intervention, funded development projects, but without any major impact.
As a system of defence and mutual assistance, the Liptako-Gourma Charter does not address economic and social development. This is essential in the fight against insecurity. For the time being, the new alliance remains a geopolitical signal linked to an embryonic security structure.","Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have a new defence alliance: an expert view of its chances of success",politics
"Changes to Kenya’s constitution in 2010 on the independence of the judiciary created room for judges to act as guardians of the electoral process.
Before this, the law gave Kenya’s presidents considerable influence over courts’ actions. Historically, the judiciary was not an independent branch. It was categorised as a governmental department working under the authority of the attorney general. The president was responsible for appointing judges.
For instance, Daniel Moi, who was president from 1978 to 2002, systematically appointed loyalists. The close links between the government and the judiciary made it pointless to go to court to challenge electoral disputes.
The 2010 constitution changed this. And in 2017, the Kenyan supreme court, the highest court in the country, annulled the re-election of the presidential incumbent, Uhuru Kenyatta. The ruling asked the electoral commission to organise a rerun of the presidential election. This was despite the threats and pressure the judges faced.
As a political scientist and former lawyer researching judicial politics in non-democratic settings, I found this change in behaviour puzzling. In a recent paper, I sought to understand why a court would take such a risk. Where judges face retaliation and pressure from political actors, why – and when – would courts take the risk of nullifying the elections of ruling party candidates?
I found that courts take such risks when there has been institutional reform. But to have this effect, the reform must meet two conditions.
First, a legal framework must shield the judiciary from political interference. It must create distance between the executive and the judiciary branch. Second, legal reforms must also mobilise judicial activists, lawyers and scholars to train and monitor courts on electoral issues. The Kenyan case illustrates how this works.
The legal framework
Kenya’s 2010 constitution put in place mechanisms to shield the judiciary from executive branch interference. First, the judiciary stopped operating under the leadership of the attorney general, an executive office. This made the separation between the two branches of power official. Second, the constitution removed the president’s prerogative to appoint judges.
My study found that constitutional reforms should not give the executive branch any decision-making power over the functioning and organisation of the judiciary.
In Kenya, the Judicial Service Commission, an independent body established under the constitution in 2010, is responsible for all appointments. Judges go through a rigorous process where their legal skills and personal ethics are questioned before they are appointed. This process prevents the president from appointing regime supporters.
Kenya’s reforms also modified the structure of the judiciary by creating the supreme court and diluting the authority of the chief justice. A new special fund gave the judiciary financial autonomy.
The constitution also contains specific provisions regulating how the judiciary settles electoral disputes. Before 2010, it took years to settle them. The constitution established a mandatory timeline. Courts have six months to deal with electoral disputes and 14 days to rule on presidential elections.
Strong judicial networks
These legal mechanisms are not sufficient on their own. They must create the space for civil society groups to interact with the judiciary, and encourage collaboration between activists, lawyers and scholars. By teaming up, these groups bring together more resources, expertise and experience.
They can help courts to resist government pressures. In Kenya, I found that these networks of lawyers, activists and scholars used three strategies to empower courts.
1. Strategic petitions
Lawyers, activists and scholars in Kenya have engaged in strategic litigation to improve the quality of election petitions, pushing courts to depart from the old English precedent, Morgan v Simpson. The 1974 ruling requires plaintiffs to show that electoral fraud occurred, and that the fraudulent behaviour affected an election’s outcome. These Kenyan networks have given courts the opportunity to change their electoral jurisprudence.
In the 2017 presidential election petition filed by Raila Odinga, the supreme court changed its jurisprudence. It established that petitioners had to prove either that electoral fraud took place, or that these irregularities affected election outcomes. This means plaintiffs don’t need to meet the two conditions at the same time, making it easier for opposition candidates to win a case.
2. Judicial training
These networks hold training and professionalisation workshops with the Judiciary Committee on Elections. The sessions help judges to deal with issues such as tight constitutional timelines. They also aim to build a more coherent approach to electoral petitions and discourage arbitrary decisions.
3. Increased scrutiny
The mobilisation of these networks has put the judiciary under intense scrutiny. They can detect inconsistencies or flawed legal reasoning in courts’ decisions. This scrutiny has direct effects on courts’ behaviour.
Most of the judges I interviewed for my paper remember the atrocities committed following Kenya’s 2007 election. For many, the judiciary’s inability to settle the electoral dispute effectively plunged the country into violence. More than 1,100 people died. The conflict almost put the future of judicial institutions into jeopardy.
The supreme court knows that any future misstep could threaten the institution’s survival and the country’s political stability.
The lessons
Policymakers can draw important lessons from the Kenyan case.
First, to prevent political actors from using courts for their own political gain, policymakers must design judicial institutions that cannot be influenced by the government’s agenda. They should identify all pathways through which governments could influence courts – not only through appointments.
Second, by funding and supporting civil society’s judicial activities, donors can help courts uphold electoral integrity and put states on the path to democratisation.",Kenya’s courts were under political pressure: how a constitutional reform empowered judges,politics
"China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which now includes 44 African countries, got under way 10 years ago. President Xi Jinping launched it in 2013 with a first speech in Kazakhstan and a second one in Indonesia. The initiative is something of a trial-by-doing development policy enigma: it keeps China watchers chasing Xi’s next move to help define just what it is.
The two speeches, however, give some lasting guidance. The Kazakhstan speech outlined five elements of the “Belt”: strengthening policy communication; road connectivity; currency circulation; people-to-people ties; and promoting unimpeded trade. In Indonesia, the five points were more abstract and diplomacy-oriented. They were framed as pursuing win-win cooperation, mutual assistance and affinity, and remaining open and inclusive.
So, what’s happened since then? As an economist with a keen interest in the political economy of China-Africa relations, I have studied the Belt and Road Initiative since its inception.
Among the more tangible achievements so far is fostering “road connectivity”. China has helped to finance and construct highways, rail and energy projects in various countries. People, goods and commodities flow more smoothly in many places than before, within and between countries. But at a cost. Most of these projects have been funded by loans from Chinese banks, including the China Export Import Bank and China Development Bank.
Marking the 10th anniversary at a forum in October, Xi outlined the progress of the initiative. He also made a commitment to raise the quality of development cooperation, and provided more details on people-to-people ties and on areas of policy dialogue especially.
Much is made of a fall in spending on the Belt and Road Initiative. But if these promises take shape, the early big spending years may come to reflect a down payment. That down payment was made in times of low interest rates and kick-started some important and highly visible infrastructural projects.
Xi’s announcement at this year’s forum offered old and new news for the Belt and Road Initiative and its signatories. For African signatories (and their regional organisations and development banks) to make the most of what China is now offering, they need to understand the origins of the Belt and Road Initiative and also what has and has not changed since.
In addition, Xi’s announcement comes at a time when China’s relationship with the African continent is changing, as I outlined in a recent article. The change sees the China-Africa relationship move beyond a focus on oil, extractive commodities and large infrastructure projects. It shifts attention to industrial production, job creation and investments that lead to African exports, and productivity-enhancing agricultural and digital technology opportunities. This model, called the “Hunan model”, is named after the province in southern China that is leading the push. This also helps to explain why China’s lending is moving from bilateral development finance to include more commercial and trade finance lending.
Comparing promises 10 years on
Xi made eight major commitments at the October 2023 forum. More than half of these draw directly from the policy focus areas announced a decade ago.
Xi promised to build a multidimensional Belt and Road connectivity. He referred to roads, rail, port and air transport and related logistics and trade corridors.
He promised to open China’s economy more to the world. Higher trade levels would be one way. Alongside a new emphasis on the digital economy, Xi added that China would establish pilot zones for e-commerce-based cooperation. In Africa, a guide to those may be provided by the two existing digital commerce hubs set up by Alibaba in Ethiopia and Rwanda under its electronic World Trade Platform Initiative.
He spoke of “practical cooperation”. This seems to refer to financing for expensive infrastructure projects, smaller livelihood projects and technical and vocational training. This has an aspect of crossover with currency circulation, people-to-people ties, unimpeded trade and more.
Xi’s recent speech also promised to support people-to-people exchanges. This is a direct take from the first launch speech of 2013. But he added detail about establishing arts and culture alliances. Also that China would host a “Liangzhu Forum” to enhance dialogue on civilisation.
Finally, in line with the earlier commitment to elevated policy dialogue, Xi promised to strengthen institutional building for international Belt and Road Initiative cooperation. This relates to building platforms for cooperation in energy, taxation, finance, green development, disaster reduction, anti-corruption, think-tanks, media, culture, and other fields.
Where extending sovereign lending may present a challenge at the moment while the legacy of debt sustainability issues is addressed, Chinese policy banks are continuing to lend to institutions of the global south. For example, in the lead up to the forum the China Development Bank agreed a US$400mn loan to Afreximbank to support small and medium enterprise trade efforts, with an eye on the goal of “unimpeded trade” and Africa’s own regional integration efforts under the African Continental Free Trade Area.
Beyond the promises made in Xi’s speech to this year’s forum, elevated funding for China’s policy banks was announced. Further, agreements made between participants also signal commitment to the original principles of the Belt and Road Initiative. For example, Xi’s speech in Kazakhstan in 2013 called for elevated currency circulation. China has not only developed its mobile payments ecosystem, but is now testing its emerging central bank digital currency, the eCNY, at home and abroad.
New promises
There are three new policy promises added to those of a decade ago.
China will promote green development, including green infrastructure, green energy, and green transportation. It will hold a Belt and Road Initiative Green Innovation Conference and establish a network of experts. China also promised to provide 100,000 training opportunities in areas of green development.
China will continue to advance scientific and technological innovation. It will hold a conference on Science and Technology Exchange, and increase the number of joint laboratories that support exchange and training for young scientists. Xi also promised that China would propose a Global Initiative for Artificial Intelligence Governance, and promote secure artificial intelligence development.
China will promote integrity-based cooperation. This would include publishing details of Belt and Road achievements and prospects, and establishing a system of evaluating compliance.
These new areas are of increasing economic importance to China, amid rapid population ageing especially, and competition with high-income countries.
The future
Where the twin launch speeches of the Belt and Road Initiative had very broad agendas, Xi’s speech at the 10-year anniversary revealed progress on earlier themes and a push to elevate the quality of development. There was more detail especially on people-to-people ties and on areas of policy dialogue to be fostered.
He added some new areas such as artificial intelligence governance, green development, e-commerce, and greater emphasis on scientific and tech cooperation. These new areas are becoming more economically important to China.
Comparing the new policy signals with the earlier ones implies that the initiative is by design adaptable. Further, since the COVID pandemic, some countries that had benefited from China’s new level of Belt and Road lending have run into debt problems and interest rates have risen. This signals China’s increased interest in lending to regional and locally present multilateral development and commercial banks that are relatively well positioned to target local entrepreneurs and development. In Africa, this offers a new chance to evolve strategies that can sustainably tap Chinese resources towards fostering the independent advance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement and local socioeconomic development.","China’s Belt and Road Initiative turns 10: Xi announces 8 new priorities, continues push for global influence",politics
"“Race” continues to have much political salience in South Africa, a country where, in the past, perceived differences of skin colour were used to construct a hierarchy of “races”, with whites at the top, to justify their political economic domination.
The move to constitutional democracy in 1994 committed the country to non-racialism. However, almost three decades after the end of apartheid, politicians of different stripes continue to use “race” as a wedge issue to mobilise support.
The question is why. Two answers stand out.
The first is that racial oppression has been entrenched by the country’s brutal history. The second is that the 1994 political settlement has failed to significantly improve the conditions of the mass of South Africans.
As a sociologist and long-term observer of South African affairs, I suggest that these arguments are not easily dismissed, despite counter suggestions that life for most South Africans has improved since 1994. Both arguments suggest that, after nearly three decades, the democracy of 1994 has become a form of neo-apartheid. Only a small black elite and middle class has been admitted to the old order of white economic prosperity and privilege while the majority of the population remains poor and black.
As long as this is the case, “race” will continue to have salience in the country’s politics, contrary to the non-racial consensus to which the constitution aspires.
A fault of history
The first argument says that “race”, as an explanatory feature of the continuing inequalities in South Africa, is hard-wired into the country’s politics by the long history of racial oppression. Moeletsi Mbeki, a provocative commentator, writes that the country’s conquest by the Dutch and the British, and the reaction of its native peoples to their conquest, is the only context in which the issues of “race” and “race relations” are understandable.
Having decimated a prosperous African peasantry to produce a massive supply of cheap labour to the mines, the British enlisted a class of Afrikaner collaborators who managed the country between 1910 and 1994.
The implication is that even if South Africa’s politics officially subscribe to non-racialism, the physical and psychological violence inflicted upon the African majority cannot be wished away. It is easily exploited as a resource by unscrupulous politicians.
Read more: How South Africa's white liberals dodge honest debates about race
Some see elections as a “racial census”, spurred on by a shift away from non-racialism within the ruling African National Congress (ANC), to prioritising black African interests. The ANC characterises its principal rival, the Democratic Alliance, as the political vehicle of white people.
Failure of the 1994 settlement
The second argument about “race” is that the foundation of the 1994 settlement  was built on the premise of a non-racial South Africa. But this has failed to significantly improve the conditions of the mass of South Africans.
In its most conspiratorial form, this presents “white monopoly capital” as having concocted a deal with an incoming black political elite. This helps white people to maintain their economic dominance over the black African majority.
More convincing are suggestions that the social democracy constructed in 1994 produced only a few winners. From this perspective, South Africa’s democracy was built on the simple proposition that the rising black elite and middle class could bargain and compromise with whomsoever it liked so long as each generation of black South Africans did better than the last.
For the first 15 years or so, this held. Although inequality remained vast, the bottom quarter of the population was enabled to rise through the expansion of a welfare state. However, following the global crisis of 2008, the state capture era under former president Jacob Zuma and COVID, this “foundational covenant” has been broken.
The lives of the younger generations are likely to become worse than those that preceded them. The levels of inequality are not only intolerably high, but racially skewed. As a result, South Africa has, according to academic and commentator Jonny Steinberg, become
a perfect cocktail for populist mobilisation.
The liberal Institute of Race Relations has argued that South Africans are far more concerned about material improvement (more houses, more jobs, improved schools, and better services) than they are about “race” and that public perception is that “race relations” have improved since 1994.
They may well be right, yet this rather misses the point that social change could well have been faster than it has been. As many black (and other) commentators point out, there is as much continuity with apartheid as there has been change.
Read more: Racism in South Africa: why the ANC has failed to dismantle patterns of white privilege
Not least the fact that whites continue to be disproportionately advantaged in terms of income, wealth, housing, and opportunity relative to other South Africans. Yet, there is an unwillingness among white people to recognise that to be white in South Africa continues to be a primary marker of socio-economic advantage.
A counter view to this is that continuing inequalities are falsely ascribed to white racial privilege rather than to the broader political and economic dynamics of post-1994 South Africa. Central to such claims is that the non-racialism to which the 1994 settlement aspires has been perverted by the ANC’s policies of black economic empowerment and employment equity.
Although those policies are officially pitched as levelling the playing fields to render society “demographically representative”, critics decry how they have become instruments for the dishing out of state contracts to those with connections to the ANC.
The debate continues with a remorseless circularity.
White versus black fragility
“Race” remains central to politics in South Africa and cannot simply be wished away, even if whites have conceded political power and offer no major threat to democracy. This does not suggest that white privilege has evaporated. Nor does it mean that there has been no significant change in racial dynamics since 1994.
We also need to understand the dynamics of class as much as those of “race” to understand why “race” remains so central to contemporary political debate.
Read more: White people in South Africa still hold the lion's share of all forms of capital
To state the obvious, whites have lost control of the state, enabling ANC policies such as black economic empowerment and the widening of access to higher education to promote upward mobility and the growth of the black middle class. Indeed, South Africa’s middle class is today as much black as it is white. This, even though the black middle class is on aggregate less well-off than the white middle class.
The critics of the political settlement of 1994 largely hail from the black middle class, even though it is the black middle class that has been one of the principal beneficiaries of South Africa’s social democracy. Despite their gains, it is they who are most likely to encounter what they perceive as “white privilege”, most notably in the workplace, as the primary obstacle to material advancement and upward social mobility.",The thorny issue of ‘race’ in South African politics: why it endures almost 30 years after apartheid ended,politics
"Israel’s siege on the Gaza Strip – after a devastating Hamas attack on Israel – has caused alarm in Egypt. Egypt shares a 12km-long border with Gaza and controls the main exit point – the Rafah crossing – for the approximately 2 million people living there.
Moina Spooner, from The Conversation Africa, asked Lorenzo Navone who has done various research on the border between Gaza and Egypt for almost 10 years, to share insights into the border’s significance.
How significant is the Rafah border crossing to both Egypt and the Gaza?
Egypt’s eastern region, Sinai, borders both Israel and Gaza. This has historically given it an important role to play in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict because it controls one of the two main border crossings for civilians. The Rafah crossing is the only border Gaza has which isn’t directly administered by Israel.
It’s vital to the survival of Gazans. Since 2007, Israel has imposed a blockade (over land, sea and air) and an embargo on the Gaza Strip. This followed the withdrawal of Israelis from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and after Hamas won the 2006 elections.
Egypt has de facto supported Israel’s blockade because the Rafah border is tightly controlled, only opening on an unpredictable and occasional basis.
The Gaza Strip and surroundings. PeterHermesFurian/GettyImages
Gaza depends entirely on international humanitarian aid, the labour of the few Palestinians allowed to work in Israel, and on tunnels dug under the Egyptian-Gaza Strip border. To both Egypt and Israel, the tunnels constitute a threat since they can be eventually used for arms smuggling and terrorist infiltration.
However, the blockade of the Gaza Strip has had a dramatic impact on the lives of more than two million Palestinians living in Gaza. They lack access to fundamental rights, including food, education, jobs and health.
For almost 20 years now, the Gaza Strip has effectively been an open-air prison. The Rafah border crossing therefore holds immense significance for Palestinians as it serves as one of the few access points for the movement of people, goods, and humanitarian aid into and out of Gaza. It allows Palestinians to maintain vital connections with the outside world and access essential resources. Its operation plays a pivotal role in easing the hardships faced by Gazans.
What does the new outbreak of war mean for the Gaza-Egyptian border?
The outbreak of the current war between Israel and Hamas, together with other Palestinian resistance factions, highlights three key issues:
the importance of the Rafah crossing for the stability of the region and for Palestinians in Gaza;
the potential expulsion of Palestinian refugees from Gaza; and
Egypt’s ambiguity towards the Palestinian people.
First, although the Rafah crossing is the only way out of the Gaza Strip, it has been closed more often than it’s been open for almost 20 years. Bear in mind that a border crossing should work 24/7.
The openings were sporadic and the conditions for a transit authorisation were unclear. It’s also unclear who governs the crossing and who decides on its openings.
In recent years, Gaza’s residents have depended on the functioning of the Rafah crossing and on the tunnels. This is even more true today: it represents an actual lifeline for Gaza’s residents.
Second, a humanitarian opening of the crossing would probably mean the arrival of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Egypt. Egypt will not be willing to welcome them because it fears that they will stay permanently.
Finally, the issue of not easily accepting Palestinians refugees brings out Egypt’s ambiguous position towards them. Among the Arab countries bordering Israel and the Occupied Palestinian territories, Egypt is the only one that hasn’t allowed the establishment of Palestinian refugee camps on its land, unlike Syria which hosts over 500,000 refugees, Jordan which hosts 2 million, and Lebanon which hosts over 200,000.
On one hand, in its rhetoric, Egypt opposes the deportation of Palestinians from Gaza and supports them in their struggle to obtain a sovereign state.
On the other hand, Egypt is currently an overpopulated country with a fragile economy and will not want a new mass of poor people entering its territory. Since 1948, it’s estimated (though it’s not truly known) that there are about 80,000 Palestinians living in Egypt. Most of them won’t have citizen rights and live outside of any legal and humanitarian protection framework.
What should Egypt do given the complexity of the situation?
Right now, the situation is very volatile, but I believe that Egypt is not managing anything at all: in fact, it rather seems a passive spectator of ongoing events.
If we rule out an unlikely Egyptian military intervention to stop Israel’s assault on Gaza (which could eventually lead to a larger regional war), Egypt only has two options.
First, to use all the diplomatic avenues at its disposal to negotiate a ceasefire. This will be an immense challenges as Israel perceives the Gaza Strip and all its inhabitants (including minors, women, and the elderly) as an existential threat, meaning that it has no intention of suspending the war nor of listening to anyone.
Or second, to provide humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced people in the Gaza Strip through safe corridors. Israel cut off Gaza’s electricity, gas, internet and water supply before its assault. Thus, Gaza is currently experiencing a total blackout and starvation.
Right now the main risk, which Egypt must bear in mind when making this decision, is the immense loss of life facing Gazans.",Egypt’s Rafah crossing is a lifeline to Palestinians living in Gaza – but opening it is still unresolved,politics
"Ghana is constitutionally a secular state. This means religious liberty is guaranteed, and all citizens are free to believe and manifest any religious faith. No political parties are allowed to base their appeal on religion.
However, the situation is changing. Church leaders are becoming more vocal on issues of national interest in Ghana. The Church of Pentecost recently proposed setting up a Christian morality council to oversee private and public behaviour. Some Christian leaders are also cultivating “insider” status with political elites and developing a high media profile.
They aim to remake Ghana according to their values and beliefs. The question is what impact that will have on democracy.
Many Ghanaians regard the country as a “nation of Christians”. According to the 2021 census, about 71% of the population is Christian. Muslims make up 18%. Followers of indigenous or animistic religious beliefs make up 5%. Another 6% are members of other religious groups or don’t have religious beliefs.
As a scholar of religion and politics, I argue in a recent paper that the “Christianisation” of politics in Ghana is an attempt to deal with Ghana’s serious problem of state-level corruption and to improve democracy. But I don’t believe it will have this effect. Rather, Christian nationalism seeks to push aside people who have other beliefs. That is not a basis for democracy. And trying to influence policy through religion will get in the way of fundamental institutional reforms that are necessary to make the government more accountable and its actions more transparent.
Christianity and politics
Influential expressions of Christianity in Ghana include the burgeoning Pentecostal or Charismatic churches, which in recent years have become the most popular churches in Ghana. Census data puts them at 44% of Christians in the country. These churches tend to have a conservative political orientation, a strong belief in the veracity of the Bible, and a message that the nation is undergoing serious moral decay.
Some leading Christians would like to see Christians governing the country and all of society according to biblical law. Archbishop Nicholas Duncan-Williams, leader of the Action Chapel, one of the most prominent charismatic churches in the country, stated in an interview in 2019 that: Christians “should rule in corporate, politics, the marketplace, everywhere”. The implication is that Christianity should be a dominant social, political and economic expression in Ghana which would project a certain worldview which all Ghanaians, whether or not they are Christians, should adhere to.
The issue is what the appropriate values are to which Ghanaians should adhere. On the one hand, there is a Christian approach, as suggested by Archbishop Duncan-Williams. On the other there is what might be called a “secular” approach where values are not linked to religious belief.
Afrobarometer data indicates that most Ghanaians are socially conservative, for example in relation to the rights of LGBTQI+ people. Many also despair about the country’s perceived moral decay, characterised by serious corruption, and about democratic decline. There has been extra-parliamentary, yet peaceful and pro-democracy, opposition to the government, demanding a new constitution and a more equitable political system.
Democratic decline
Ghana transitioned from several years of military rule to democracy in 1993. It has since conducted several free and fair elections. It has a reputation as a democracy. America’s National Intelligence Council stated in 2008 that “Ghana has emerged as one of Africa’s most liberal and vibrant democracies, reclaiming a position of political leadership on the continent.”
In recent years things have changed under the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party, both of which have had turns governing the country.
Sweden’s V-Dem (“Varieties of Democracy”) Institute categorised Ghana as a liberal democracy in 2003-2014 and again in 2017-2020. This description changed to “electoral democracy” in 2021 and “autocratizer” in 2022 – indicating steep democratic decline.
The American organisation Freedom House says the decline involves “discrimination against women and LGBT+ people”. It also notes “weaknesses in judicial independence and the rule of law”. It points out corruption, poor public service delivery, political violence and illegal mining.
A Christian solution?
There are several ways to deal with these issues. One is to amend the constitution to reform government and the state, making functionaries more accountable and policies more transparent.
The Church of Pentecost, Ghana’s largest church, with more than three million members, favours another way. It suggests creating a National Morality and Integrity Council with statutory powers to oversee private and public behaviour, even at state level.
The church believes that to improve democracy and reduce corruption it is necessary for practising Christians to play a leading role in society – including government. According to Joyce Aryee, a former government appointee and Christian leader, this would “infest others with their purity” and transform behaviour for the good.
Critics argue, on the other hand, that bringing more Christians into positions of leadership and having a morality council to oversee society would weaken democracy. Ghana must nurture a diversity of beliefs, motivations and behaviours. It could then pursue the common good by drawing on a variety of worldviews, reasoning, values, aspirations and habits – not only those deriving from Christianity.
Mutual respect
Democratic development can only be realised when citizens make a moral commitment to treat each other with the same respect as they would like to receive. It is necessary to care for each other’s wellbeing as one might care for one’s own growth and happiness.
Ghana’s democracy will fail unless the moral agency of citizens works to moderate economic and social iniquities, by reforming democratic institutions.",Christian leaders in Ghana are trying to reshape government – it may not end well,politics
"In times of crisis, leaders wield more than just political power. They harness the art of rhetoric in a bid to unite their nations towards a common goal. South Africa, with a tumultuous history marked by apartheid, has seen leaders employ persuasive communication to navigate challenges.
For instance, in the 1990s then-president Nelson Mandela appealed to patriotic sentiments. He often used reconciliatory rhetoric to help smooth the transition from centuries of colonial and apartheid oppression to democracy for South Africans.
In 2020, at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Cyril Ramaphosa faced the challenge of steering the country through one of its biggest crises since democracy in 1994.

I’ve been a media and rhetoric scholar for a decade. My colleague and I examined Ramaphosa’s communicative approaches during the pandemic. Our paper on his speeches looked at how leaders use their speeches to unify citizens amid turmoil and uncertainty.
In his regular televised addresses, commonly known as family meetings, Ramaphosa tried to promote nation-building. The pandemic had exposed the nation’s deeply entrenched economic and social divisions. Fostering social cohesion and unity was vital to improving the overall response to the pandemic.
A unified and socially cohesive society was more likely to adhere to health guidelines, cooperate in efforts to control the virus, and ensure that vulnerable populations had access to necessary resources and support.
Rallying cry
We analysed the four speeches Ramaphosa delivered in the early stages of the pandemic – between March 24 and April 21. These speeches, when COVID-19 cases were still relatively low, but uncertainty loomed large, provide a critical window into Ramaphosa’s leadership and persuasive techniques.
We observed that Ramaphosa’s communication style bore distinct traits of what has been “Mandelaism” by some academics to rally South Africans behind a common cause. So-called after the iconic statesman, Mandelaism refers to rhetoric that appeals to patriotism to promote national unity and reconciliation. It is
based on mythologising Nelson Mandela, and imagining a South African nation characterised by ‘harmony, peace, reconciliation, and success, denying the significance of informational disturbances that contradict these narratives.
Additionally,
Mandelaism perpetuates a narrative of forgetting that overlooks the realities of apartheid oppression.
This rhetorical approach tends to discourage dissent, underpinning the belief that all South Africans share the same goals.

Our analysis of Ramaphosa’s rhetoric and its parallels with Mandelaism provides a case study of leadership and communication in times of crisis. It offers lessons for current leaders and scholars, highlighting the enduring influence of historical figures like Nelson Mandela on the rhetoric and leadership styles of their successors.
Ramaphosa’s rhetoric
Little scholarship exists on Ramaphosa’s political-ideological convictions and philosophy or describes his approach to persuasion. The historian Tom Lodge has observed that
Cyril Ramaphosa gives many interviews, but he keeps his personal philosophy to himself.
The COVID-19 crisis forced Ramaphosa to communicate continuously. It provided an opportunity for rhetorical critics and scholars to consider how he used persuasive techniques, and how these might point to his ideas about the South African nation.
Ramaphosa frequently began his addresses with the inclusive greeting, “My fellow South Africans”. This sought to invoke a sense of belonging and unity. As a linguistic technique it primed citizens to connect with the ideals of togetherness, inclusivity and reconciliation. These are all critical components of Mandelaism.
Ramaphosa’s rhetoric also emphasised reconciliation. He urged citizens to remember past hardships they had overcome together. This appeal to historical resilience reinforced the idea that South Africans unite in moments of great crisis. It echoed Mandela’s ability to unify a nation divided by apartheid. For example, in a speech delivered on 9 April 2020 Ramaphosa said:
I wish to thank you for reaffirming to each other and to the world that we South Africans are a people who come together … Our ability to come together in a crisis, and our commitment to each other and our common future.
He downplayed the diverse perspectives and experiences of South Africans to promote the unity narrative.
And then there is each of you, the 58 million South African citizens and residents who are standing together to confront this national health emergency.
A significant aspect of Mandelaism is its close association with corporate entities that fund Mandela-related projects. Ramaphosa also incorporated business as a force for good in his speeches. He portrayed business as integral to the fabric of a reconciled South Africa.
Lessons for uniting nations
South Africa’s journey from apartheid to democracy and its response to the COVID-19 pandemic provide rich examples of the role of political rhetoric. These historical instances serve as invaluable lessons for leaders worldwide facing the daunting task of uniting their nations during times of uncertainty and turmoil.

"Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president, died on 16 October at the age of 86. Born in eastern Finland, he was two years old when his family fled from the Russian invasion at the outbreak of the second world war.
A trained school teacher, he moved in 1960 to the Swedish Pakistani Institute in Karachi. In 1965 he joined the Finnish foreign service. His posting as a diplomat in Tanzania in 1973 was the beginning of lasting bonds to the African continent. Only two years later, he started his commitment to the struggle for self-determination of the Namibian people.
Namibia, then called South West Africa, was under the illegal control of apartheid South Africa. According to the United Nations, it was “a trust betrayed”.
Namibia and its decolonisation process have been among my interests as a scholar. Martti Ahtisaari played a crucial role in the United Nations supervised transition to independence, as documented in his biography, aptly titled The Mediator.
The government of Namibia awarded him honorary Namibian citizenship after independence. Upon the news of his death he was locally praised as
a light during Namibia’s dark days.
Namibia’s President Hage Geingob described him as a friend of the Namibian liberation struggle and a leading peacemaker. Through the United Nations, he “played a pivotal role in midwifing the birth of a new Namibia”.
Ahtisaari’s work in Namibia was the beginning of a long and successful engagement in international conflict mediation. Many more diplomatic achievements in various parts of the world followed.
Ahtisaari and Namibia
Ahtisaari’s involvement in Africa began in 1973 when he was appointed Finland’s ambassador to Tanzania. At the time, the anticolonial movements of southern Africa had offices in Dar es Salaam, home to the headquarters of the African Liberation Committee of the Organisation of African Unity.
In 1975 he was appointed as a senator to the council of the United Nations Institute for Namibia. The institute was established in Lusaka by the United Nations Council for Namibia, officially inaugurated in 1976. Its mandate was to prepare for Namibia’s independence by drafting blueprints and training staff. Geingob, at the time representing the South West African People’s Organisation (Swapo) liberation movement at the United Nations, was appointed as its director.
At the behest of Swapo, Ahtisaari was appointed as UN commissioner for Namibia in March 1977 and relocated from Dar es Salaam to New York.
In July 1978 the UN Security Council asked the UN secretary general to appoint a special representative for Namibia to ensure independence of the country through free elections under the supervision of the UN. With support of the US-American diplomat Don McHenry, Ahtisaari was again the choice. As McHenry was quoted in Ahtisaari’s biography:
I thought why don’t we kill two birds with one stone. Ahtisaari was clearly sensible to the views of the Africans but he was at the same time very practical and got results. He was, then, the very man for the job.
Ahtisaari henceforth wore two hats related to Namibian affairs. His term as commissioner ended in April 1982. In 1987 he was appointed as the UN under-secretary general for administration and management on the condition that he retained his role as special representative for Namibian affairs.
In 1978 UN Security Council Resolution 435 was adopted as the blueprint for Namibia’s transition to independence. But it was shelved after being blocked by US under President Ronald Reagan and the UK under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The resolution was finally implemented more than a decade later, after the global realignments following the end of the Cold War.
The United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (Untag) was tasked with implementing Resolution 435 from April 1989 to March 1990. Under Ahtisaari, with Botswana’s UN ambassador Joseph Legwaila as his deputy, Untag accomplished the mission.
This was due in large part to the skills and credibility of Ahtisaari. As special representative for Namibia more than a decade before the implementation of Resolution 435, he had gained the trust of a variety of stakeholders. This gave him personal leverage, which he was able to apply in critical situations.
Under Untag supervision, a constituent assembly was elected in Namibia in November 1989, chaired by Geingob. In early 1990 its members adopted the country’s constitution as the normative framework. Independence was declared on 21 March 1990.
Ahtisaari remains publicly remembered locally by a school and streets bearing his name.
Mediation beyond Namibia
Ahtisaari’s merits during his international career translated into a successful campaign in domestic politics. Serving his country in government first as foreign minister, he became in 1994 Finland’s president for a six-year term until 2000.
But his heart remained in international conflict mediation. Upon leaving office, he founded the Crisis Management Initiative, an independent non-governmental organisation.
Ahtisaari played an active role in Serbia’s withdrawal from Kosovo in the late 1990s. During the Northern Ireland peace process at the same time, he monitored the Irish Republican Army’s disarmament process. In 2005 he was brokering the autonomy for Aceh province in Indonesia. The same year he was appointed by the UN secretary general Kofi Annan as special envoy for the future status process for Kosovo.
Among the numerous honorary recognitions of his role in mediating conflicts, South Africa awarded him in 2004 the Order of the Companions of Oliver Tambo (Supreme Companion) for
his outstanding achievement as a diplomat and commitment to the cause of freedom in Africa and peace in the world.
In October 2008 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts.
Explicit reference was made to his role in Namibia’s transition towards independence. Between 2009 and 2018 he was a member of The Elders. Founded in 2007 by Nelson Mandela, this group of independent global leaders works for peace, justice, human rights and a sustainable planet.
As Geingob declared:
today, we are not only mourning the loss of Ahtisaari, a friend and one of us, but we are also reaffirming the rich legacy of peace and the outstanding international public service of a Nobel peace laureate with an indelible association with Namibia.",Martti Ahtisaari: the Finnish peacemaker who played midwife to Namibian independence,politics
"As the Israeli-Hamas crisis continues, a great deal of focus is shifting to Egypt. Egypt shares a border with both Israel and Gaza – the narrow strip of Palestinian territory which is currently under blockade following the violent attack against Israel by Hamas, a radical Islamist organisation that has controlled Gaza since 2007.
Moina Spooner, from The Conversation Africa, asked Ofir Winter, who studies Egyptian politics and the Arab-Israeli conflict, to provide insights into what the new war means for Egypt and the role it plays.
What’s been the relationship between Egypt and Israel and Palestine in the past?
Egypt performs a balancing act in managing relations between Israel and Palestine.
Egypt openly expresses its commitment to the Palestinian cause. This is because Palestine’s quest for self-determination is a central Arab and Islamic cause. Also, due to geographical proximity, any escalation in Gaza will have a direct impact on Egypt’s national interests.
This position is reflected in its reaction to the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas. Following the deadly killings and kidnappings of innocent Israeli civilians by Hamas earlier this month, Egyptian members of parliament and state-owned media, have portrayed Israel as the aggressor and Hamas as the victim.
In accordance with past actions, Egypt can be expected to take several steps to demonstrate its solidarity with the Palestinians. These include; the provision of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, evacuation of some wounded to Egyptian hospitals, and increased role in mediation efforts for a ceasefire. These steps make Egypt a key actor in the conflict and would help strengthen its regional and international standing.
However, Egypt also doesn’t want to alienate Israel. Ultimately, they have a mutual interest: they do not want to see the resurgence of political Islam in the region. This is linked to Egypt’s own experience of Islamist organisations.
The current regime in Egypt ousted the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 and outlawed them. The Brotherhood is a transnational Islamist organisation, founded in Egypt in 1928. It’s aims are to promote social and political change in Muslim-majority countries. After the Arab Spring in 2011, the Brotherhood held power in Egypt for one year before being ousted.
Hamas is an offspring of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is why Egypt perceives it as a threat.
But despite Egypt’s suspicious approach to Hamas, since 2017 there’s been an understanding between the two: Hamas’ cooperation in fighting terrorism in Sinai would be met with an easing of the Egyptian blockade on Gaza.
Though the relations between Egypt and Israel are cooperative, they’re not warm. Egypt signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1979. And, over the past decade, Israel has positioned itself as a key political, security and economic partner to Egypt.
In recent years, Egypt has been a mediator between Israel and Hamas and in the reconstruction efforts of Gaza. This is because of its proximity to Gaza and the fact that it controls the Rafah crossing – the only border with the Gaza strip that’s not under Israeli control.
But Egypt’s involvement with Gaza has certain lines that won’t be crossed.
There will be no Egyptian military involvement against Israel for the benefit of the Palestinians – a policy which primarily derives from Egypt’s commitment to the 1979 peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.
There will also be no sanctioned mass entry of Gazans into Egypt, according to declarations by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and other Egyptian officials.
How does the current crisis affect Egypt?
Egypt has so far rejected the idea of displaced Palestinians moving into Sinai. But there is the possibility that a large number of Gazans will seek entry. This is separate to the Gaza residents with foreign citizenship who are already waiting at the border to cross.
Egypt is against allowing Gazans crossing the border in large numbers because it opposes any encroachment on its sovereignty in the Sinai Peninsula. Its major concern is that displaced Palestinians may establish a permanent residence in its territory, potentially undermining the already delicate security and economic situation.
The situation also poses a large security risk to Egypt.
First, border breaches by refugees from Gaza, some of whom may be armed individuals affiliated with Hamas or other radical groups, could export instability to Sinai. For Egypt, there is a danger that there could be more terrorist attacks and instability as there were in Sinai before the 2017 understanding with Hamas. Some of those attacks were carried out by well-armed and trained Gaza-based militant cells.
Second, a massive blow to Hamas may lead to a lack of governance, chaos, and instability in Gaza. This will cause instability and could give rise to the smuggling of weapons and fighters along Egypt’s border with the Gaza Strip.
The other security threat is that terrorist acts could be launched from Sinai into Israel by Palestinian militant groups putting the delicate relationship between Israel and Egypt at risk.
How has Egypt reacted and what should it do next?
Since the outbreak of the war, Egypt has been working to de-escalate the situation in Gaza and has been conducting talks with Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, the US, Iran, and other regional and international players.
The Arab League has already convened in Cairo, and an international conference in Egypt is expected to take place this weekend. Egypt is also seeking to establish a humanitarian corridor for the delivery of food and medicine to the Gaza Strip.
At this stage, Egypt has more control than most other regional international players over the outcomes of the conflict, as well as plenty of interests.
The outcome of the conflict could deliver some benefits. For example, Egypt desires the return of the Palestinian Authority, who is more willing to engage in diplomacy and negotiations, as the governing authority in Gaza. A scenario where Hamas is significantly weakened could pave the way for new developments, possibly including the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority. In this case, Egypt and Israel could find a more pragmatic neighbour across their borders.
If Hamas loses power at the end of the war, Egypt will most probably be involved in the government transition phase. As in the past few years, Egypt is expected to be the conduit through which aid and funds from Arab countries and the international community will be transferred into Gaza, participate in its reconstruction process, and be a dominant influencing factor on shaping its future.",Hamas-Israeli conflict: what’s at stake for Egypt,politics
"Mozambique is a multi-religious southern African nation with excellent relations between faiths. Relations between Muslims and the state have been good too. But the situation became more complicated in 2017 when a bloody jihadist insurgency broke out in the north. Eric Morier-Genoud has published extensively on politics and religion in Mozambique. His latest book, Towards Jihad? Muslims and Politics in Postcolonial Mozambique, looks at the historical relationship between Islam and politics in the country. He fielded some questions from The Conversation Africa.
When was Islam introduced to Mozambique?
Islam has a very old presence in Mozambique. It is estimated to have arrived within the first century of the start of the faith, with Arab, Ottoman and Persian traders. It settled at once during and after the 8th century among new Swahili networks, cultures and societies that developed on the east African coast between Somalia and what is today Mozambique.
Expansion of the Islamic faith inland was slow and only made significant progress in the 19th and 20th centuries. This was the time when European colonial powers occupied Africa, building new infrastructure such as roads and railways that helped the spread of different faiths.
At independence in 1975, Muslims represented 15% of the population of Mozambique. The latest census indicates it stood at 19% in 2017. Today Muslims live mostly on the coast and in the north of the country. A majority of the population of Niassa and Cabo Delgado provinces are Muslim, as are 40% of the population of Nampula province.
What’s been the political experience of Muslims since independence?
A majority of Muslims, like all other religious people in the country, were in favour of independence. But when Frelimo, the liberation movement, came to power at independence in 1975, its policy was socialist-oriented and the government turned against religion. Frelimo saw faith as a superstition and an impediment to its programme. It closed churches near state and educational institutions, restricted religious practice, and even ran atheist campaigns between 1978 and 1980.
In the 1980s, the Frelimo party-state shifted towards tolerance, meaning a policy of minor religious restrictions and a strict separation between state and church/mosque. Frelimo party members were prohibited from being members of a religious institution. Faith institutions were ordered to focus on religion only.
In the 1990s, after the end of the Cold War and the official abandonment of socialism, the Frelimo government moved towards a freer religious regime.
Nevertheless, the post-socialist 1990 constitution did not allow political parties based on regionalism, ethnicity or religion. So there’s a limit to what Muslims can do politically for their faith.
A law to recognise Muslim religious holidays in the 1990s was blocked by the Supreme Court in the name of secularism. Muslims argued this was unfair since Christmas is an official holiday, although called “family day”.
Similarly in the 2000s Muslim politicians (organised in a formal cross-party lobby in parliament) struggled to influence a new law to define the family, inheritance rights and women’s rights.
Consequently, many Islamic organisations and politicians have moved away from politics in the last two decades, to focus on education, social works and proselytism.
What led to the current insurgency?
There is much debate about the causes of the jihadi insurgency in northern Mozambique. Researchers have identified poverty, youth marginalisation, ethnicity and religion as push factors.
The pull factor is a jihadi project of more justice and equality through sharia law and a caliphate. It offers an alternative plan for state and society, and a path to it through violence. The insurgency developed regionally (in connection with Tanzanian jihadis) and the insurgents connected formally to the Islamic State, the international terrorist group, in early 2018.
Read more: Mozambican terror group is strikingly similar to Nigeria's deadly Boko Haram
My book shows that the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Mozambique do not want full sharia law and a caliphate. Nor do they accept the violence used to achieve these objectives.
The insurgents have nevertheless settled militarily in the extreme north, where they have established bases in deep forests and rely on Islamic State for some technical support and public relations.
What support, if any, do the insurgents enjoy in Mozambique?
Insurgents enjoy hardly any support nationally. Locally, they draw some support from networks they established, from long-held local grievances, and from mistakes the state, the army and the police have made since the start of the conflict.
Other dynamics have come into play, including displacement, violence, uncertainty and fear. Today, the “Al-Shabaab” insurgents (as they are known in Mozambique) operate in a territory of about 30,000 square kilometres which represents less than half of the province of Cabo Delgado (one of the 11 provinces of Mozambique).
This is a very limited territory, but one where crucial economic projects are located. Among others, private investment is unfolding for the production of onshore and offshore LNG gas, and companies have developed graphite projects that have turned Mozambique into the second largest world producer of this mineral.
The insurgents have hardly expanded since they began their armed insurrection in October 2017. In 2021 they carried out attacks in Niassa and Nampula, but they withdrew rapidly. It is not clear whether they chose not to expand, or whether the government and its international allies have been effective in containing them. Still, the armed conflict continues today, six years on.
How can the peace be restored?
This is a topic of debate. The government has been active mostly militarily, with an international intervention since 2021. It wants to root out those it calls international “terrorists”.
Many commentators and partners of Mozambique believe that to resolve the conflict, one also needs to address the root causes: poverty, youth marginalisation and ethnicity. Donors and the Mozambican government have started social and economic programmes focusing on youth and on economic development in the north of Mozambique. Even private companies such as TotalEnergie want to engage in such programmes.

An element which has not been touched upon yet relates to the pull factors. There are several possibilities. One would be for the state and civil society to develop a reflection and consultation about the future of the country and about inclusion and representation. It could look at social, economic, political, historical, cultural, and religious elements, aiming to establish a medium-term “agenda for the nation”.",Between state and mosque: new book explores the turbulent history of Islamic politics in Mozambique,politics
"No census is ever exact: as academics Tom Moultrie and Rob Dorrington at the University of Cape Town have noted previously:
a census is not, in reality, a full and accurate count of the number of people in a country; rather, it is itself an estimate of the size of the population at a moment in time.
South Africa has announced the results of its fourth census as a democracy – Census 2022. I have been involved in the process for the last four years as chair of South Africa’s National Statistics Council. As outgoing chair, my last task was to take part in the release of Census 2022.
The census found that the national population has grown to 62 million, up 10.3 million from the last census in 2011. Gauteng is now clearly the most populous province in the country, with 15.1 million people, overtaking KwaZulu-Natal (12.4 million). The Western Cape jumped from fifth to being the third largest province, with 7.4 million people. These figures are important because they inform resource allocation by government.
What is perhaps most striking about Census 2022 is the very high undercount – 31% of people and 30% of households were missed (or chose not to self-enumerate, either online or via zero-rated telephone methods). This is the highest undercount of any post-apartheid census; sadly, it may set a new international record.
A census is immediately followed by a Post Enumeration Survey, which identifies where the census missed people. This allows Statistics SA to develop adjustment factors, or weights, so that the final data represents an adjusted final tally. The Post Enumeration Survey is used to manage the undercount. Census undercounts are the norm, not the exception. But it is safe to assume that with weighting on this scale – adjusting for an undercount of 31.06% – analysts may identify some confounding results.
At aggregate level, Census 2022 is robust. At sub-national – and especially sub-provincial – levels, however, it may be less so. Only time and data analysis will tell.
The census confirmed the global trend of declining survey response rates. People are less and less inclined to be involved in the process. This raises the question: does a fieldwork-based census have a future? Given the challenges that faced Census 2022, I believe the census may need to be re-imagined as a very different exercise. This requires Statistics South Africa, which conducts the census, to fully engage with big data to bring the process into the 21st century.
The process
South Africa’s National Statistics Council, an independent body of experts that advises the statistician-general and the minister in the presidency regarding statistics, had secured a number of local and international experts – as had Stats SA – to stress test the census and the Post Enumeration Survey. Council never has prior sight of the data: its job is to focus on methods and process.
The experts do engage with the data and flagged only a few variables (mortality data, and some service and asset questions which had too many non-responses to be reliable) as requiring a cautionary note. Council engaged vigorously with the experts and Stats SA, and with no red flag raised by any, we declared the census “fit for purpose”.
It is notable that Stats SA routinely conducts a post enumeration survey. Many countries do not, even when there is systematic undercounting of particular groups (often young men, children and minorities). Moreover, Stats SA will make available both the weighted and the raw data for analysts to examine in detail. This transparency should be welcomed, given that (as previously noted by the United Nations Statistics Division) issues of undercounting affect all countries, and estimating the undercount and whether to adjust the data is a political issue “throughout the world”. The undercount was high, but not as a result of any lack of effort or commitment from Stats SA.
Why the undercount
The undercount is the result of many factors.
First, the context matters. This time round it was as bad as it could be, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting training and supply chains for equipment. The pandemic also generated anxiety in a populace that had been avoiding contact with strangers as part of social distancing. Census planning usually starts three or four years prior to fieldwork. Training about 100,000 enumerators is a major effort in its own right, combined with the shift to digital platforms for the first time. All were affected by the pandemic.
The fieldwork took place after the devastating July 2021 insurrection, and after the hard-fought local elections. The process also coincided with xenophobic violence meted out by the anti-migrant pressure group-turned-political party Operation Dudula in Johannesburg. Taken together, the effect was a deep-seated reluctance to open doors to strangers, particularly those asking lots of questions.
A second factor that affected the gathering of data was the fact that there is very low trust in the government. Although the census is conducted by Stats SA, which is an independent entity, it is seen as “government”. This label didn’t make it easy to persuade people to allow an enumerator into their dwellings and answer questions.
People in the Western Cape, the only province not run by the African National Congress, were particularly resistant to being enumerated or self-enumerating. This was true even after the provincial premier and Cape Town mayor made public calls for people to comply. The undercount in the Western Cape stands at 35.58% of people and 36.3% of households. In the Free State, by comparison, the undercount is 20.95% of people and 17.93% of households.
A third factor was that response rates have been getting consistently lower over at least the last decade. This has been true for Stats SA and other entities undertaking primary research. The decision to go digital was an attempt to open different avenues for people to complete the questionnaire online, or by phone, to improve response rates.
People appear to be sick and tired of being polled by everyone, from their local supermarket to endless tele-marketers and others. They also appear much more wary of sharing their data. What, then, is the future for the census?
Enter big data
Countries around the world are facing the same challenge of low response rates.
The advent of big data opens intriguing possibilities.
A first step would be to harvest data from the records kept by government departments (assuming they are run well). In addition, data could be unlocked if a working relationship was developed with private sector entities, such as suppliers and banks.
Becoming far more tech-savvy, and encouraging people to engage with Stats SA digitally, could be combined with other options to compile a national population dataset. It would also represent a significant cost-saving. This approach – harvesting data rather than gathering it directly – is being considered by many countries, but has not yet been attempted, and Stats SA needs to carefully consider this option.
Stats SA needs to fully engage with the world of big data, and the key players in that data ecosystem. It has convening authority, and should be engaging all key players, whether they are academic, private sector or others.
At the very least, an alternative way of conducting the next census in 2032 must be rigorously examined and tested.

"The Mauritius Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional a law that criminalises consensual same-sex acts between adult men. The decision boosts the trend in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region towards decriminalisation. Now, a slight majority – nine out of 16 member states – do not prohibit gay and lesbian sexual relations.
I have researched and taught human rights law in Africa, including the rights of sexual minorities, for over three decades, and closely follow the work of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.
The African Commission, as the continent’s human rights custodian, should lend its unequivocal support to the decriminalisation trend. This is particularly significant as attempts are made to further criminalise and stigmatise sexual minorities in parts of Africa.
The commission has not yet expressed its view on the decision. Its 77th ordinary session, starting on 20 October 2023 in Arusha, Tanzania, is an opportunity to do so. It should build on its 2014 guidance to African states on eradicating violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Mauritius court ruling
The Mauritian Supreme Court found that section 250 of the 1838 Mauritius Criminal Code, which criminalises anal sex between two consenting adult men, violates the 1968 Mauritius constitution.
The litigant, Ah Seek, a gay Mauritian man and board member of the Mauritian NGO Collectif-Arc-en-Ciel, invoked a number of constitutional grounds. However, the court based its decision on the most directly relevant ground: the right not to be discriminated against.
In addressing two issues that could militate against a finding in Ah Seek’s favour, the court relied on the approach of other courts in the SADC region. The 2021 judgment by Botswana’s Court of Appeal was particularly relevant. This judgment held that the constitutionally protected ground of “sex” in the Botswana constitution encompassed “sexual orientation”.

The first issue was the contention that Mauritius’ constitution does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on “sexual orientation”. The relevant provision (section 16) forbids discrimination on the basis of seven specified grounds, including sex.
The Mauritian court concluded that the word “sex” in section 16 of the constitution includes “sexual orientation”.
The court also emphasised the country’s international human rights commitments. It said that, as a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Mauritius was expected to interpret its constitution in line with this treaty.
The second issue was whether the rarity of prosecutions removed the need for the court to decide. Referring to a judgment by the South African Constitutional Court, the Mauritius court held that the mere threat of arrest, prosecution and conviction
hangs like the sword of Damocles over the heads of homosexual men.
The court therefore concluded that the constitution protected everyone from discrimination based on their sexual orientation, whatever it might be.
When it was given an opportunity to show any legitimate purpose for this form of discrimination, the state merely made reference to same-sex relations as a “highly sensitive issue” due to the “delicate socio-cultural and religious fabric of Mauritian society”. Rejecting these as justifications for discrimination, the court underlined that Mauritius was a secular state.
Regional trend
Greater societal acceptance of homosexuality can be both a catalyst for and a consequence of decriminalisation of same-sex relationships.
In a recent survey by the independent African surveys network Afrobarometer, Mauritius featured prominently as a country in which tolerance (towards an LGBT person as neighbour) had increased from 2014 to 2022.
Nine of the 11 African countries with an above-average tolerance percentage towards LGBT persons were from the SADC. All of these 11 states, except Eswatini, have decriminalised “sodomy laws”.

The conditions for decriminalisation seem to be converging in Eswatini. Its population displays a relatively high level of acceptance (of 42%) in the survey. Also, its Supreme Court has signalled some openness to uphold LGBT persons’ rights.
Besides Eswatini, other SADC member states that still retain “sodomy” laws are Comoros, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. With the exception of the Comoros, the laws of these states are relics from British colonial times, when “sodomy” laws were imposed as part of a colonial “civilising” mission. The Mauritius Supreme Court noted that, as a colonial import, section 250 did not reflect Mauritian values and was not the “expression of domestic democratic will”.
Today, just over half of the SADC states do not criminalise same-sex relationships between consenting adults. The Democratic Republic of Congo never legislated on this matter. In Lesotho (2012), the Seychelles (2016), Mozambique (2015) and Angola (2019), the legislature in the last decade or so adopted a new version of the penal code. These offences, stemming from the English common law or the 1886 Portuguese Penal Code, were omitted. In Madagascar, the penal code criminalises consensual same-sex acts only with a person under 21 years old.
Still, the situation remains in flux. In Malawi and Namibia, litigation on related penal code provisions is pending. In Malawi, then President Joyce Banda in 2012 committed to repealing these laws. There was also a moratorium on arrests and prosecutions between 2012 and 2016, and a court-ordered review of the constitutionality of “sodomy laws”.
In Namibia, the Supreme Court decided in 2023 that Namibia must recognise same-sex marriages validly concluded outside the country.
Diverging trend
In the rest of Africa, the position of sexual minorities is much more precarious. Thirty-one (almost 58%) of countries still criminalise consensual same-sex acts between adults. The trend is towards more restrictive laws and harsher punishment.
In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has signed into law the Anti-Homosexuality Act.
In Ghana, the Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill is being considered.
In Kenya, the anti-gay Family Protection Bill carries a 50-year jail term. But the Supreme Court decided in February 2023 to allow the NGO National Gay and Lesbian Rights Commission to be registered.

African Commission’s role
Against this background of opposing forces and divergent trends, the role of the African Commission is all the more important. The commission itself has sent mixed signals.

But it also refused to grant observer status to NGOs working to promote these rights.",Mauritius is the latest nation to decriminalise same-sex relations in a divided continent,politics
"Hamas’ brazen and deadly attack on Israel on October 7 elicited varied responses within the South African political scene. These diverse reactions reflect the long history, since before democracy in 1994, of South African engagement with the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The conflict holds symbolic significance for many in the country.
As with the war in Ukraine, taking sides on the issue also allows the different parties to highlight their position on the struggle for or against global western dominance
The South African government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), characterised the recent events as a “devastating escalation”. However, it primarily attributed the situation to Israeli policies, including “the continued illegal occupation of Palestine land, continued settlement expansion, desecration of the Al Aqsa Mosque and Christian holy sites, and ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people”.
It called for
the immediate cessation of violence, restraint, and peace between Israel and Palestine.
It also urged Israel to embrace the two-state solution as a means of resolving the conflict. The two-state solution suggests the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Read more: Why the push led by South Africa to revoke Israel’s AU observer status is misguided
For its part, the ANC put out its own statement in the name of the party. This gave even bolder support for Hamas. The party’s national spokesperson, Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri, defended Hamas’ actions, invoking the enduring solidarity between the ANC and the Palestinian cause.
It can no longer be disputed that South Africa’s apartheid history is occupied Palestine’s reality… the decision by Palestinians to respond to the brutality of the settler Israeli apartheid regime is unsurprising.
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a far-left pan-Africanist party which was formed after a split from the ANC, and is now the third largest party in parliament, endorsed Hamas’ use of violence. Drawing parallels with the anti-apartheid struggle, the party’s spokesperson squarely placed the blame on Israel.
Conversely, several movements offered their solidarity with Israel. The liberal Democratic Alliance, the main opposition party, vehemently condemned the “unprovoked attack” by Hamas. It decried the
senseless violence and all acts of terror against innocent civilians, women and children.
Some centrist or traditionalist parties, such as the Patriotic Alliance and the Inkatha Freedom Party, also voiced their criticism of the attacks. South Africa’s principal Jewish organisations also extended their support for Israel.
Historical roots
Unwavering support for Palestinian nationhood has remained a steadfast element of South African foreign policy since the ANC came into power in 1994. This stance has seen the country become one of the most prominent voices critical of Israel globally.
The ANC has thrown its support behind the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, a movement aiming to replicate the iconic anti-apartheid boycott campaign. South African officials have consistently accused Israel of practising apartheid. The country’s parliament recently voted to formally downgrade the country’s relations with Israel from embassy to a liaison office.
I have been researching the history of the relationship between South Africa and Israel for nearly a decade. My research has found that both the ANC and some pan-Africanist formations once held more complex perspectives on Israel and Zionism.
They generally expressed support for Jewish statehood from the 1940s to the 1960s. For instance, in the early 1960s, both the ANC and its primary rival in the anti-apartheid struggle, the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), considered Israel as a potential ally in their battle against apartheid. The PAC also received substantial financial assistance from Israel until 1970.
However, the ANC’s resentment towards Israel for its collaboration with white minority rule during the 1970s and 1980s, coupled with the perception of Palestinians suffering an apartheid-like oppression, has come to shape the party’s perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Since the late 1960s, the ANC has cultivated strong ties with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). By the 1980s, these ties had evolved into a strategic and operational alliance between the two movements. In recent years, with the weakening of the PLO, the ANC has shifted its support towards the PLO’s erstwhile rival, Hamas. The Muslim constituency in South Africa, many of whom are ANC supporters and activists, further contributes to the party’s pro-Palestinian stance.
The DA’s support of Israel also has historical roots. Historically, liberal or so-called “moderate” parties and individuals in South Africa have been the most consistent pro-Israeli political voice in the country.

Unlike the post-1970s ANC, many liberals have regarded Israel as a democracy with a decent record in treating minorities. In the Western Cape, which is the only province governed by the DA, there has been a greater willingness to explore collaboration with Israel.
In addition, in recent decades, various Christian and traditionalist forces have also strongly tended towards pro-Israeli views.
South Africa last asked people for their religious affiliation in a household survey in 2013. The figures at the time showed there were just over 1 million Muslims and just over 101,500 people of the Jewish faith. More recent data indicates that the Jewish population in the country was dropped to about 50,000 people. The latest census puts the entire population at 62 million.
Long legacy of international alliances
The diverse perspectives of South Africa’s political parties on Israel/Palestine also mirror their distinct international allegiances. Having valued the assistance of the Soviet Union and China in their struggle against apartheid, and nurturing deep-seated grievances against the western role in supporting apartheid, the ANC and more radical movements have tended to stand beside actors that challenge the US on the global stage.
This policy has been particularly evident in South Africa’s sympathetic stance towards Russia, even amid Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Conversely, the opposition DA has aligned itself with pro-western stances.
However, it’s uncertain whether most South Africans support the ANC’s approach to contemporary foreign relations issues. A poll from November 2022 found that 74.3% of citizens condemned Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
It is likely that the Palestinian cause enjoys higher levels of popular support. But, there are indications that views on Israel/Palestine are far from clear-cut. A study from 2017, for instance, found that there was similar support in South Africa for both Israelis’ and Palestinians’ “rights to a homeland” (54% and 53%, respectively). But the study also concluded that actual knowledge of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was limited, with only 29% having “heard of” the conflict.

South Africa’s official stance on Israel-Palestine is one of the most critical in Africa, particularly compared to other states south of the Sahara. Over the past decade, Israel has seen increasing bilateral relations with various African states. Several opinion polls indicate that public perception of Israel in sub-Saharan Africa is among the most favourable worldwide.
Lingering divide
South African politicians have framed the recent escalation between Hamas and Israel within the broader context of their perspectives on global dynamics. As with the war in Ukraine, the governing ANC and more radical elements unequivocally support the Palestinians – their longstanding allies. They view Hamas as representing the Palestinian cause, and perceive Israel as an apartheid state.
The liberal DA’s support for Israel is also shaped by historical and contemporary factors. It mirrors the enduring liberal backing of Israel in South Africa. It also allows the party to align itself with western governments that have recently expressed support for Israel.",Israel-Palestine conflict divides South African politicians – what their responses reveal about historical alliances,politics
"For the past decade many residents in north and central Nigeria have lived in a perpetual state of fear. Conflicts between pastoralists and farmers, land disputes, cattle rustling and mass violence have driven millions of people from their homes.
In total, more than 3.6 million people in Nigeria have been displaced. Many have sought refuge with relatives in neighbouring communities and in internally displaced persons camps.
Benue State in north central Nigeria (its major local government areas include Guma and Gwer-west) has borne the brunt of this crisis. The United Nations says there are 2.1 million internally displaced people in Benue State alone; the majority live in internally displaced people camp facilities within host communities such as Abagana and Daudu.
A great deal of attention is focused on the conflict and on people’s displacement. But that isn’t the end of the story. Both state and non-state actors offer ongoing support for people who have been displaced by herder-farmer conflict. As a researcher investigating people’s experiences of victimisation, I wanted to find out what form this support took, what displaced people thought of the interventions and whether this support was helping them to reintegrate into their original communities.
The resulting study revealed a complex relationship between reintegration decisions and experiences with displacement support and return settings. In Benue State, displaced victims have four primary support systems: individual, government, faith-based groups and NGOs.
Four forms of support
There are four main forms of support being offered to displaced people in Benue State.
1. Individual support: People from surrounding communities visit camps, actively participate in camp activities, and generously donate food, cash, clothes, and items for young and adolescent children. They offer a personal kind of support that not only sustains those living in the camps but also uplifts their spirits.
One woman I interviewed said:
…(T)here are still some persons who come here on their own without knowing anyone of us personally to distribute things to us. There are plenty like that, they will drive here with plenty items like noodles and sugar and food.
2. Support from social and cultural groups: Various sociocultural and political groups play a crucial role in providing support. These groups include political parties looking for endorsement and validation, cultural clubs and associations. The people I interviewed felt that while some of these groups were acting from genuine good will, others had hidden political motives. Still, their provision of food, clothing, cash and other goods was welcomed.
3. Faith-based support: The displaced population is mostly Christian; the remainder is Muslim. Religious groups establish a unique connection with victims, bonded by shared faith. Some provide genuine support, while others may seize the opportunity for evangelism or recruitment. Promises of jobs, education and improved lives become lifelines for those searching for hope amid turmoil. One interviewee told me:
One of the people that have really supported me is the redeemed church people from Makurdi. Since they preached to me and I accepted them, they have been good and supportive to me. They promise me to help me get a job in the town when (the) time comes.
4. Support from NGOs and the State Emergency Management Agency: The majority of support for internally displaced people comes from humanitarian non-government organisations working closely with the Benue State Emergency Management Agency. These organisations manage and coordinate activities in the camps, offering not only material aid but also a sense of normalcy through social events and distributions of emergency relief materials and survival amenities.
Looking ahead
These support systems all play an important role in providing emotional, social and practical assistance to those displaced by the conflict in Benue State.
They can also help smooth the path for people to resettle in their own homes and communities. One interviewee, who had returned to the home he’d fled, said the support he received while displaced and since resettling had helped:
I have received different amount of support since I returned. I received rice and beans with vegetable oil, and later received plant chemicals, fertiliser and seeds to plant on my farm.
Recognising and strengthening these support networks is vital for a brighter future for Benue State’s displaced communities. For this to happen, the affected communities must be engaged and involved in long-term planning. All the groups involved in providing support should collaborate while efforts continue to end the conflict that has torn Benue State apart.",Over 2 million Nigerians are displaced by farmer-herder conflict in Benue State: there are 4 support systems they turn to,politics
"More than five months have passed since intense fighting broke out between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group also known as the RSF. In that time, more than 7,000 people have been killed and nearly 4 million others displaced. The conflict is still ongoing, with little evidence of resolution.
The clashes were sparked by a disagreement over how the RSF, led by Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, more commonly known as Hemedti, could be integrated into the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, led by Gen. Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan.
Sudan is the third-largest country by area in Africa. It is also home to the Nile River basin, is mineral rich and is strategically located on the Red Sea, close to the Middle East. So this conflict comes with heavy security and economic ramifications for the region and beyond.
As a political science professor who studies civil conflicts, I know that stability in Sudan requires a concerted effort from the international community. So far, a variety of efforts have failed. However, I believe that applying a right mix of international measures at the right time can give Sudan a chance at peace.
Roots of conflict
Much like Somalia and the former Yugoslavia, Sudan is what is known as an “anocracy” – that is, a political regime in transition from autocracy to democracy.
Anocracies are prone to armed conflicts. Mainly due to the growth of paramilitaries and weak civilian control of the military, they face frequent coups and rebellions.
Sudan experienced a major armed conflict in the western region of Darfur from 2003 to 2020, during which former president Omar al-Bashir used RSF paramilitaries to violently suppress rebel groups.
However, as the RSF grew more powerful, attempts to integrate it into the Sudanese army failed. And in 2022, a power struggle between the two groups ensued.
The conflict has displaced millions of Sudanese in recent months, including over 40,000 refugees currently living at this camp in Metche, Chad. Abdulmonam Eassa/Getty Images
The limits of mediation
Turkey, Ethiopia, Egypt and Israel have all offered to mediate between the SAF and RSF in Sudan. So did the African Union, along with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an eight-country trade bloc in Africa. They proposed Kenya as the key mediator.
The SAF and RSF have not accepted any of these offers.
Efforts by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have yielded several ceasefires, including a 72-hour ceasefire from June 18-21, 2023, but no concrete agreements.
Successful mediation requires that the mediator has leverage to offer incentives to the warring parties, and also maintains impartiality between them.
When it comes to Sudan, no mediator has managed to offer terms acceptable to both warring parties. Furthermore, many of the potential mediators have supported one side or the other.
Kenya and the United Arab Emirates have been accused by the Sudanese army of supporting the RSF, which fought in Yemen and Libya alongside the UAE. Egypt, meanwhile, supports the SAF due to traditional ties with Sudanese generals.
And while the U.S. does not have an official position of support for either side, partly due to the atrocities committed by both warring parties, its Saudi partners in the Jeddah talks back the SAF. This may stem from their rivalry with the UAE.
But what doomed the Jeddah talks was not this perceived Saudi bias but the lack of political leverage. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia failed to provide clear and concrete terms that could be acceptable to both warring parties.

Sanctions fall short
U.S. sanctions have targeted specific entities or individuals that disrupt the democratic transition in Sudan.
On June 1, 2023, the Department of the Treasury announced sanctions against four companies within the gold mining, vehicle and weapons industries that it accused of funding or arming the warring parties. Two of the companies were affiliated with the SAF, and two were linked to the RSF. Three months later, the department also sanctioned Hemedti, the RSF leader.
Usually, the United Nations coordinates sanctions with the U.S., and U.S. allies follow suit. However, this cascade of sanctions has yet to happen. The U.N. Sanctions Committee has not added any new sanctions on Sudan yet, while the European Union is working on a framework for such sanctions.
While current and future sanctions may hold, targets often find alternative sources of funding. Despite U.S. sanctions targeting Hemedti’s RSF reliance on the gold trade, Russia has stepped in to supply weapons and training to Sudan in exchange for gold to fund its war in Ukraine.
Peacekeeping efforts hold promise
International peacekeeping can be effective in conflict zones, particularly when the efforts are properly resourced. Peacekeeping missions in the Ivory Coast from 2004 to 2017 and in Croatia from 1996 to 1998 are often cited as success stories.
The United Nations-African Union Mission, or UNAMIS, was a peacekeeping mission in Darfur from 2007 to 2020 that used both police and troops to provide a buffer zone. The missions had only partial successes, mainly due to the lack of support from the al-Bashir government.
In 2020, after the UNAMIS ended, the U.N. Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan, or UNITAMS, was tasked to assist political transitions in Sudan. However, it lacked police or troops, and its potential efficacy is heavily disputed.
An integrated approach
Observers of Sudanese politics and experts of international relations have suggested many solutions to stabilize Sudan, prevent further atrocities and eventually resolve the conflict.
These include stopping Hemedti’s flow of money, sending peacekeepers with troops and police, involving the International Criminal Court to investigate atrocities, coordinating political dialogue between international actors and warring parties, and restraining outside influences – such as from the UAE or Russia – that weaken the effect of sanctions on Sudan.
One integrated solution is to combine peacekeeping and mediation. This would mean augmenting UNITAMS with police and troops from the U.N. Peacekeeping division, while forging a united diplomatic front on the international level.
A short-term action for this united front would be to employ the U.N. mediation team. With a roster of experienced international mediators, the mediation team can try to provide opportunities for political dialogue.
A long-term solution, and one suggested in the international Peace Treaty Initiative, is to institutionalize the mediation effort. Once a country accepts the proposed treaty, it can request mediation before or after conflict erupts. This process avoids the difficulty of getting to the mediation table in the first place, while guaranteeing a coordinated and concerted mediation process.
A window of opportunity
In April 2023, the warring parties rejected international mediation offers and failed to send delegates for internal mediation in Khartoum, Sudan’s capital. Until mid-August, neither side seems had seemed to have reached the stage of a “hurting stalemate” – which is sorely needed for parties to come to the negotiation table.
However, with the death on Aug. 23, 2023, of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner group in Russia, Hemedti has lost a key Russian ally. This leaves him more vulnerable to U.S. sanctions on the gold trade. In fact, this may have been what prompted him to suggest a peace proposal on Aug. 27.
As for Burhan of the SAF, he has tried to burnish his image by visiting Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and he gave a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 21. This occurred after the SAF had to move to Port Sudan from Khartoum, where the RSF took a stronghold.
Given the weakened positions of both the RSF and SAF, a mediation window may open soon.
Challenges ahead
Any effort, however, is not without challenges.
A sufficient supply of well-resourced peacekeeping personnel is not guaranteed in this age of retrenchment. UNAMID was a US$1 billion endeavor, while UNITAMS’ current budget is $34 million a year.
Forging a united international front is another challenge, given the various foreign alliances both warring parties have.
Other tools are limited, however. For example, sanctions will not affect Burhan that much, as the SAF still has air power and will be able to sustain its airstrikes.
Despite the challenges ahead, Sudan cannot be ignored. However, a lasting resolution requires multiple measures that can augment each other. The lack of external interference, plus an impartial mediator and U.S. leverage, will be essential ingredients for mediation to move forward. And the mix of measures must be applied with the right timing and with the right actors involved.",Peace in Sudan is elusive for any would-be mediators – but a new window of opportunity has opened for outside intervention,politics
"South Africa is drawing nearer to a landmark national general election in 2024. Based on recent electoral trends and opinion polls, the governing African National Congress (ANC) is expected to drop below 50% of the national vote for the first time since democracy in 1994.
The end of single party dominance is expected to result in the country having its first national coalition government since the ANC came to power. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the country’s third largest party, is a must watch in that transformation. The party’s electoral support has been growing since 2014, amid declines for both the ANC and the Democratic Alliance (DA), the main opposition.
In that time period, the ANC’s electoral support has fallen from over 62% in 2014 to 57.50% in 2019, and the DA’s from over 22% to 20.7%. The EFF’s share of the vote rose from just over 6% in its first election in 2014 to about 11% in 2019.
The EFF also gained more seats in provincial legislatures and municipal councils in 2014 and 2016. Research shows that it’s been appealing to mainly young voters.
Read more: South Africa votes in 2024: could a coalition between major parties ANC and EFF run the country?
We are political scientists with experience in leftist parties in Latin America  and South Africa. We did a critical analysis of the EFF through the lens of the party’s communication strategies. We analysed survey and exit polling data as well as the ideology, strategy and tactics of the EFF from a political communication theory perspective. Political communication focuses on how political actors craft and distribute their messages.
Based on the findings, we argue that the EFF has gained its modest but significant standing in South African politics by stealing the ANC’s mantle. It portrays itself as the true custodian of the values the ANC espoused during the anti-apartheid struggle, as stated in the Freedom Charter, its blueprint for a free South Africa. The EFF accuses the ANC of having abandoned this agenda. This has enabled black South African voters to shift their support from the ANC to the EFF without changing their political orientation.
This lies behind the EFF’s decision to focus its messaging around land and jobs. These resonate given the country’s history of black land dispossession and stubbornly high unemployment, especially among young people.
Electoral performance
The EFF was founded as a political party in July 2013 following the expulsion of its leader Julius Malema from the ANC in 2012. Malema had been president of the ANC Youth League before being expelled for misconduct.
The EFF went on to garner 1.2 million votes in 2014, and 25 seats in parliament. Come the 2019 national election, it won 44 seats in parliament with just under 1.9 million votes.
The strength of the EFF is greatest in the North West province, where it garnered 17.9% of the vote in the 2019 national general elections. This is followed by Gauteng (13.53%) and Limpopo provinces (13.14%).
It is the official opposition in North West, Limpopo and Mpumalanga, where it got 11.51%. It continues to battle in the Western Cape (4.1%) and Eastern Cape (7.72%). Its share of the vote in KwaZulu-Natal increased from 1.97% in 2014 to 9.96% in 2019.
In the 2021 local elections, the party received 10.31%, mainly replicating its 2019 national results.
Ideology, strategy and tactics
Our analysis sought to understand the drivers of the EFF’s growth and its role in the party system. We analysed the ideology of the party and its strategy and tactics as stated in its electoral documents.
Ideologically, the party’s 2013 founding manifesto states that it
draws inspiration from the broad Marxist-Leninist tradition and Fanonian schools of thought in their analyses of the state, imperialism, culture and class contradictions in every society.
It positions itself as “anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist” and opposes what it calls the “neoliberal agenda” of the ANC.
The EFF declares that it is a radical and militant economic emancipation movement, rooted in popular grassroots formations and struggles. These include workers’ movements, NGOs, community-based organisations and lobby groups.
In a bid to position itself as a viable radical alternative to the ANC, the EFF has used “grievance exploitation”, radical posturing, agenda setting and framing in its strategic arsenal. Inequality, racialised land ownership patterns, persistent racism, unemployment and other issues are the main grievances the party has exploited.
It has done this through political communication and theatrics in parliament – including wearing the uniforms of workers, disrupting proceedings and chanting slogans – as well as the issues it has chosen to fight for in “the streets”, social media, the courts and party events.
It has had skirmishes with allegedly racist companies, white farmers and schools, and many other opponents that help drive its narrative.

The EFF’s success in the North West, Mpumalanga and Limpopo appears to have a lot to do with the party’s rhetoric on the mining sector, which is prominent in these provinces. The party’s strategic political communication portrays it as fighting for oppressed mine workers or host communities in these areas.
Its overtures in Marikana, the site of the 2012 massacre of striking mineworkers by police, attest to this.
Additionally, Limpopo is the home base of the founders of the party, Julius Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu. Founder constituencies tend to contribute significantly to a party’s success in South Africa. For instance, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Freedom Party are strong in KwaZulu Natal, where they were formed and their leaders originate.
Our findings show that EFF supporters among students who had come from the ANC cited corruption and failure to deliver on promises as their reasons for changing. Those who had shifted from the Democratic Alliance were drawn by the appeal of the EFF as a more radical alternative.
Looking forward
In our view the party appears to have lost some momentum in terms of its political communication strategy after the fall of former President Jacob Zuma in February 2018. It has also made some tactical mistakes. For example, it started calling President Cyril Ramaphosa corrupt and similar to Zuma, without proof.

"Religion is highly present in Ethiopia. It’s visible in churches and mosques, in clothing, and in public rituals.
The country’s main religious communities are Orthodox Christians, Muslims and Protestants. It’s home to one of the world’s oldest churches and has the third-largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa. Orthodox Christians account for about 43% of the population, while approximately 33% are Muslims. Protestant Christianity arrived in the late 19th century and has expanded rapidly in recent decades to account for an estimated 20% of the population.
Ethiopia is often portrayed as a unique case of harmonious inter-religious relations where Christians and Muslims have lived peacefully together for centuries. But the country has also seen religious conflicts.
In the last three decades, there has been a worsening of religious tension. In 2022, for instance, more than 20 people were killed following attacks on Muslims in the north-western city of Gondar.
Ethiopia is constitutionally a secular state. Religion has no formal place in politics. Shared spaces and government buildings are to be free from any religious expressions. However, this has been unevenly practised. Religion is present everywhere.
I am a scholar of religion, with extensive fieldwork and research experience in religion, ethnicity and politics in Ethiopia. In a recent paper, I analysed the developments over the last decades that have affected inter-religious relations, worsened polarisation and produced conflicts.
In my view, five factors have contributed to the rise in religious tensions.
First, the political transition in 1991, which allowed for greater expression of religious activities and changed the religious landscape. Second, the expansion of Christian Protestantism from the early 1990s. Third, the rise of a more visible and assertive Muslim population. Fourth, the response from the Ethiopian Orthodox church to a loss of influence. Finally, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed allowing religion to enter the public political discourse.
Growing conflict
Civil war and ethnic conflicts have dominated news coming out of Ethiopia in recent years. Religious and ethnic identities are closely connected, but the ethnic dimension of conflict has tended to overshadow the growing tensions between religious communities.
In 2018, young rioters burned churches and killed several priests in Jijiga, in the eastern Ethiopian state of Somali. In 2020, Muslim properties were attacked in Harar, eastern Ethiopia, during celebrations of an Orthodox Christian holiday. In 2022, attacks on Muslims in Gondar turned deadly. Such incidents have eroded trust between Ethiopia’s religious communities.
Inter-religious violence is often blamed on so-called extremist elements. However, a closer look reveals a more complex picture.
The drivers
The political transition in 1991 and the arrival of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front led to important changes to the political, social and cultural landscape. Seeking to promote equal rights for the country’s ethnic and religious groups, the new government lifted formal restrictions on religious activities.
This affected the balance of power between religious groups. Historically, Ethiopia’s inter-religious co-existence was made possible by one community dominating the others.
Since its establishment in the fourth century, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church had been intimately tied to the state. The domination of the church contributed to the marginalisation of other religious communities. The 1974 Ethiopian Revolution ended the state-church marriage, and the changes after 1991 further eroded the church’s position and brought other religious communities in from the shadows.
The second driver of tensions has been the rise of Protestantism. Initially brought by western missionaries in the late 19th century, the religion was mainly found in Ethiopia’s non-Orthodox southern region. Protestantism grew rapidly after 1991, with churches and ministries expanding into traditional Orthodox and Muslim areas. On occasion, this has led to violent conflict. In 2006 and 2010, for instance, clashes erupted in the southwestern area of Jimma.

The 1991 changes also led to Islam becoming more visible in the country. Various Islamic reform movements began strengthening religious identity among Muslims and countering their historically marginalised position. This produced a more assertive community. Muslims have become more active in Ethiopia’s social and political life. Numerous mosques have been built across the country. And Muslims have become increasingly visible through a changing dress code, particularly the use of veiling among women, and through public celebrations of religious holidays.
Many Christians, both Orthodox and Protestant, interpret a more visible and assertive Muslim community as proof of Islamic “extremism”. It’s commonly claimed that mosques and religious schools are funded by Saudi Arabia. And that the ultimate aim of Ethiopia’s Muslims is political power.
Research has shown that Saudi religious activism has actually dwindled over the last years. But the narrative about such ties continues to fuel suspicions and affect Christian-Muslim relations.
All these developments have been challenging for the Orthodox church. Many of its members are changing their affiliation to Protestantism. The Orthodox church has made efforts to limit this. It has, for instance, prohibited the construction of Protestant churches and mosques in Lalibela and Axum in Ethiopia’s north. The church has declared these cities as sacred Orthodox spaces.
The Orthodox church has also sought to reclaim its lost space by, for example, celebrating religious holidays through highly visible ceremonies. During its Meskel holiday in September this year, the Addis Ababa government placed restrictions on the celebration.
The church’s responses have provoked reactions among other religious communities, particularly Muslims who view its actions as an attempt to curb the space they have carved out for themselves.
Finally, Abiy’s political language is laced with semi-religious references. The prime minister is a practising Pentecostal. His acknowledgement of religion has enabled actors to lift religion into the public sphere in ways that have sharpened boundaries and added to the tensions.
Way forward
Religious identities and belonging are important in today’s Ethiopia. Changes over the last decades have, however, deepened inter-religious tensions. There is potential to alleviate these tensions. Doing this will require political and religious leaders to communicate across religious boundaries to accommodate Ethiopia’s plurality.",Ethiopia: religious tension is getting worse – 5 factors driving groups apart,politics
"In a ringing judgment for the right to privacy, the South African Constitutional Court declared sections of the country’s main communication surveillance law unconstitutional in February 2021.
The court gave parliament three years to pass a new law remedying the areas of unconstitutionality. The February 2024 deadline for these amendments is looming fast.
The Regulation of Interception of Communication and Provision of Communication Related Information Act (Rica) was intended in part to protect privacy, combat crime and promote national security. It requires all cellphone sim cards in the country to be registered, and prohibits interception of people’s communications without their consent, except under certain conditions.
But Rica had some weaknesses which have been abused by rogue elements in intelligence. The court case was brought by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, after the state misused Rica to spy on the centre’s managing partner, Sam Sole, in an attempt to reveal his sources of information.
The justice ministry has produced an amendment bill to meet the court’s deadline.
Having researched issues relating to communication surveillance and its oversight for years, my view is that the amendment bill is flawed. It doesn’t provide enough safeguards against the violation of privacy.
The problem with Rica
In terms of Rica, intelligence and law enforcement agencies must apply to a special, retired judge for interception directions (or warrants) to conduct surveillance to solve serious crimes and protect national security. The judge is appointed by the justice minister.
Read more: South Africa's intelligence agency needs speedy reform - or it must be shut down
The court found Rica to be unconstitutional on the following five grounds:
People don’t have to be told that they have been under surveillance.
The appointment and renewal processes for the Rica judge lack independence.
The judge only has to hear from one side: those applying for interception warrants.
Rica does not ensure that intercepted data is safely managed.
Rica fails to recognise that lawyers and journalists have a professional duty to keep their sources and communications confidential.
The court prescribed two interim measures while the law was being redrafted. The first was that within 90 days of an interception direction (warrant) having lapsed, those state agencies applying for surveillance need to inform the surveillance subject that they have been spied on. The second is that applicants must also tell the judge if the surveillance subject is a lawyer or journalist.
Post-surveillance notification
With the proposed amendments, the justice ministry has responded largely by reproducing the court’s first interim measure. However, it has added another clause stating that if notifying someone that they have been surveilled could potentially have a negative impact on national security, then the judge may withhold notification and for such period as may be determined by the judge.
This clause is too broad and does not provide an ultimate deadline for notification. It introduces speculation into the decision-making. That’s because the impact needs merely to be possible. There is no requirement to show a national security threat, merely a possible negative impact.
Independence of the Rica judge
The justice ministry has inserted a requirement for the Rica judge to be appointed by the justice minister, in consultation with the Chief Justice. This is adequate to the extent that it means that decision does not rest with the executive only.
The ministry has also introduced an entirely new position of a review judge, to automatically review the decisions of the Rica judge. It would have been better to build automatic review into the process once surveillance subjects have been notified. That might make the review process more robust as the subject may provide details that shed new light on the Rica judge’s decisions. If the judge’s decision to grant the warrant was misplaced, this could lead to the original decision being overturned or intercepted material being destroyed.
Read more: South Africa's intelligence watchdog is failing civil society. How to restore its credibility
However, given the load of several hundred cases a year, one judge may not be enough, either at the decision stage or the review stage. Consideration should be given to establishing a panel of judges.
Hearing both sides
It is possible that the review judge was introduced to respond to the problem of hearing only from the applicant (the “ex parte” problem). If that is the case, then it is not an adequate response. Both judges will still be making decisions based on the same one-sided secret evidence.
Rather, as amaBhungane argued in the Constitutional Court case, the bill could include a new position of a public advocate, to defend the interests of the surveillance subjects.
The public advocate could be granted security clearance, in line with well-recognised processes involving “cleared counsel”.
Such lawyers have clearance to access the secret evidence the state is relying on. They are on the same footing as the agency applying for surveillance. They will be able to interrogate the case beyond what is provided for in the application.
As has been argued recently, the public advocate could represent the interests of surveillance subjects who decide to take decisions on review following post-surveillance notification.
Confidentiality for lawyers and journalists
Regarding the need for the applicant to inform the judge that a subject is a journalist or lawyer, the ministry has left out an important safeguard from the interim measure provided by Constitutional Court’s judgment. It required the judge to grant the warrant only if necessary, which means that the warrant must be an investigative method of last resort.
On the management of surveillance data, the court required more details in the law on how and where surveillance data must be accessed, stored and destroyed. The justice ministry has failed to provide such detail.
Metadata surveillance
The amendment bill is silent on possibly the most serious surveillance issue, relating to the state’s massive and underregulated surveillance of data about a person’s communication, or metadata. Rica allows the state to use procedures other than those provided for in the act to access metadata.
For example, the state has preferred to use section 205 of the Criminal Procedure Act as it contains much lower privacy standards than Rica. It is thus open to abuse.
One solution is to make Rica the only law governing access to metadata, but retain the procedure whereby the ordinary courts can grant warrants, rather than restricting decision-making to the Rica judge only, to ensure speedy decision-making.
Missed opportunity
The justice ministry had more than enough time for the review of Rica, section 205 and the entire surveillance setup to assess whether they were still fit for purpose.
The failure is an indictment on the ministry’s leadership of the review process. It missed the opportunity to address the growing concerns about unaccountable state spying.",South Africa’s surveillance law is changing but citizens’ privacy is still at risk,politics
"Liberia, Africa’s oldest republic, is about to choose its next president.
On 10 October, 46 political parties and 20 presidential candidates will compete for two million registered votes at 5,000 polling stations in 15 counties.
But whoever wins will confront a polarised Liberia.
Liberia is more divided than it has been since the end of its 14-year civil war in 2003. The war ended with the signing of a peace agreement, but its scars are still visible across the country.
Frustration around the soaring cost of living, cronyism, patronage, nepotism, and the culture of impunity which triggered the war is once again tearing the country of 5.4 million people apart.
There are also external factors that could undermine Liberia’s recent progress. For example, the Mano River Union, a sub-regional body of which Liberia is a founding member, remains volatile.
The recent military coup in Guinea, the anti-government protest in Sierra Leone and the violence around Alassane Ouattara’s third-term re-election “victory” in Côte d’Ivoire are signals of vulnerability within the Mano River Union.
The next president will have to address three priorities to restore hope and confidence in Liberia’s recovery:
national cohesion
corruption
stronger state institutions.
My previous analysis of Liberia revealed the country’s inability to manage its internal conflicts. It also showed how Liberia’s reliance on regional powers like the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) escalated and prolonged disputes. The next president must recognise these realities and address the three priority areas.
Falling living standards
There are growing concerns in Liberia that the George Weah-led administration is not doing enough to improve living standards.
There were high expectations of change when the president took office in 2018. Many expected him to lift them from poverty. They saw a real chance for a better future. Today, however, a good number of Liberians feel he has lost his connection with poverty and with the people who elected him into office.
Over 50% of Liberians live below the poverty line. The rising cost of basic commodities prevents families from meeting their food needs.
Weah alone is not responsible for all of Liberia’s problems. His administration inherited irregularities that plagued previous governments.
Endemic corruption
Corruption shows up in many forms and at all levels in Liberia. It disrupts democratic decision-making processes, weakens public trust in government and undermines the rule of law.
The nation’s integrity institutions lack independence. They include the Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission, the General Audit Commission and the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
These agencies were created to curb corrupt practices. But they lack political independence, capacity and resources.
They are further weakened by a culture of impunity. And managerial appointments are often made on the basis of cronyism (jobs for friends and colleagues) and patronage (using state power to reward selected voters for electoral support).
Corruption is prevalent in the judiciary too. Judges solicit bribes in exchange for decisions that favour offenders.
President George Weah and his predecessor, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, ran on the promise of fighting corruption. Both failed to live up to their commitment.
In 2017, after her terms as head of state, Sirleaf admitted that her government had not done enough to fight corruption.
In 2022 Weah had to suspend three of his top officials after the US imposed  sanctions on them for corruption and abuse of state functions. No investigation has been launched and none has been prosecuted.
Weah himself has faced serious criticism for his refusal to declare his assets upon taking office and for violating Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative’s standard procedures.
The country ranks 142nd out of 180 countries in the corruption perception index. It could slide back into chaos unless the next leader takes serious actions.
Like Sirleaf, Weah pledged to build an equal, fair and just Liberia. But his lack of action in the fight against corruption sends the wrong message to development partners. And it undermines voters’ confidence in the electoral system.
Voters’ confidence in the upcoming poll is already low. A study by the Center for Democratic Governance in Liberia shows only 34% of Liberians believe in the ability of the National Elections Commission to hold a free and fair elections.
The lack of trust in the electoral system is reinforced by the commission’s failure  to release the final voter roll 16 days before the elections. This has cast further doubt on the commission’s credibility and neutrality.
Impunity
There is also anger over the government’s failure to establish tribunals to try individuals accused of war crimes, as recommended by Liberia’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
Victims of the war want to see warlords punished for their crimes. But the call for justice is ignored as Weah and politician Joseph Boakai (Sirleaf’s vice-president from 2006 to 2018) forge stronger alliances with perpetrators and war profiteers.
Weah’s 2017 election victory was largely attributed to the support he received from warlord Prince Johnson. Weah was also supported by Jewel Howard Taylor, his vice-president and ex-wife of Charles Taylor, Liberia’s 22nd president, convicted for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone.
Weah and Johnson have long parted ways. Johnson has given his support for the 2023 general elections to 78-year-old Boakai.
However, Weah is not isolated. He still enjoys popular support from his status as a football star, his coalition with Taylor, and his new alliance with Roland Duo, a former rebel commander who boasts of his crimes.
Former warlords control large voting blocs, sought after by presidential candidates. Establishing a war crime court would amount to political suicide.
But the new president must introduce genuine reforms and promote good governance if he is to sustain peace or govern a region filled with political backstabbing, resource competition and the struggle for new global alliances.
Way forward
The next head of state must act decisively on deep-rooted and unresolved grievances.
He or she must address public sector corruption, grant full independence to the nation’s transparency institutions and provide adequate resources for the Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission and the General Audit Commission to hold offenders accountable.
Liberia’s next president must ensure that the recommendations of the General Audit Commission are followed through and empower the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate and indict those suspected of bribery, embezzlement and illicit enrichment.
Low-level corruption should not go unpunished. That includes things like patients paying bribes for medical treatment, and teachers demanding special favours from students to pass an exam.

"At 63 the story of Nigeria can be anything from the “celebration of greatness to an act of barbaric cruelty”. These are the words of Nigerian writer Dipo Faloyin in his book Africa Is Not a Country.
Nigeria attained its independence from Britain on 1 October 1960. Nearly half a century earlier, in 1914, the British amalgamated the Northern and Southern British protectorates into the Nigerian Federation. For many — including the Nigerian independence leader Chief Obafémi Awólòwò, in his book Path to Nigerian Freedom – the country that emerged from this amalgamation was “a mere geographical expression”.
Since independence, Nigeria has made deliberate attempts to knit a cohesive nation from this legacy of division. This has included measures such as power sharing arrangements, the creation of the National Youth Service Corps, as well as its vibrant cultural expressions through food, sports, and literature.
But there have also been missed opportunities at unity due to leadership failures on the part of successive Nigerian governments. In the end, as research shows, divisions persist. These often overshadow the country’s achievements.
We are political scientists and researchers with published works at the intersection of politics, culture, and society and the international politics of Africa.
We offer four reasons why Nigeria remains divided. We identified these as ethnic and religious division, economic disparities, identity and lack of nation building.
Divisions
Most nations have been crafted out of disparate cultures. According to the Irish political scientist and historian, Benedict Anderson, all nations are imagined.
However, our observation is that the first reason for persistent disunity in Nigeria is the depth of ethnic and religious division.
Ethnic and religious division: This must be placed in the context of colonial mapping and plunder of material and cultural resources.
This came about from cobbling together starkly different cultures, lands and peoples. Before colonialism, what is now called Nigeria was peopled by different kingdoms and empires. These ranged from the Hausa states and Kanem-Bornu empire in the north, the Jukun states in the north central region, to Yoruba states in the south west, and Igboland and Delta City-states in the south.
The arbitrary borders drawn by the British during colonisation bundled together these numerous ethnicities and peoples without regard for their historical, cultural or socio-political differences.
Britain ruled Nigeria for close to 80 years. The Crown governed through what was called indirect rule. This allowed the colonial administration to govern from a distance. It delegated local administration to traditional authorities and native institutions.
Nigeria is home to over 300 ethnic groups – the Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and Fulani are the major ones. Each group has its own language, culture, and traditions.
Nigeria is also divided along religious lines. It is predominantly Muslim in the North and Christian in the South. Indigenous religions are spread across the country, with some experiencing no dualism between these spiritualities. Indeed, this non-binary spiritual disposition was what made the Christian and Arab missionaries successful in Africa.
Economic disparities: The British Crown governed its conquered colonial territories through different systems of authority. Over time, these translated into different levels of economic development.
In the north, the colonial government relied on existing political structures of “centralised governing systems with a reputation for their bureaucratic, administrative, and judicial institutions” – mainly relics of the Sokoto Islamic Caliphate in the region.
In the South, however, the colonial administration revolved around artificially created authorities. These were usually in the form of warrant chiefs – a native leader whose legitimacy was based on a warrant issued by the colonial government rather than on the people’s culture and custom.
These different governance systems were allowed significant autonomy under the colonial system of indirect rule. Different levels of economic development began to emerge, which in turn created economic disparities. For instance, northern Nigeria has the highest concentration of less economically empowered states, communities and peoples.
Identity: As we have argued elsewhere, Nigeria was conceived by the colonial government as a business enterprise corporation, not as a nation. As one scholar pointed out, British rule also promoted the ideas of ‘the “North for Northerners,” “East for Easterners,” and “West for Westerners” within Nigeria.
Independence promised a new Nigeria that benefited all Nigerians. But the country failed to savour the “independence” moment. Nigerian leaders who took over wasted the opportunities offered by the gains of independence to dismantle the inherited colonial fissures of their societies.
Leaders such as the Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafémi Awólòwò and Sir Nnamdi Azikiwe rose to champion the cause of their respective ‘ethno-regions’. They became guilty of Frantz Fanon’s charge of the pitfall of the nation being passed over for the race, and the tribe being preferred to the state.
This was to translate into a series of coups and conflicts, including the civil war of 1967 in which about a million people died.
We have argued that the failure to savour the independence moment makes Nigeria – not just the colonial administration – complicit in its identity crises. We also acknowledge how ground-level activists and people across the different divides shape the country’s future through everyday expressions of nationhood. Nigerians are intermarrying. They’re doing business together. And they often express a general sense of pride and unity in the country’s food, sports, music and movies.
Lack of nation building: Some scholars agree that nation building requires state building. Nation unity, therefore, comes on the heels of effective action being taken by the state. But that’s not how Nigerians experience their government. For them, the state doesn’t exist behind rituals of statehood.
In the state’s absence, citizens resort to what they have – their identities – as tools for survival. This further widens ethnic fault lines and creates new ones.
A lack of investment in the infrastructures of the state has also created deplorable conditions for ordinary Nigerians.
The outcome of using identities for political scores and advantage? The proliferation of conflicts and violent clashes.
Moving forward
At the everyday level, Nigerians should focus on advancing and celebrating their soft cultural resources. These include comedy, sport, food, music, movies, and a general sense of hope and positive interaction. We argue that this ground-level, soft but courageous and clear-minded activism has the potential to restore hope in the nation. It could even achieve more.
For its part, the Nigerian state must open its doors to the people, and address their economic hardships and insecurity. If this doesn’t happen the danger is that Nigerians will abandon democratic ways and turn to violence, as we are witnessing across West Africa and the Sahel.",Nigeria at 63: four reasons for persistent disunity six decades on,politics
"An estimated 800,000 people work as domestic workers in South Africa. Most are black women from marginalised backgrounds. It’s therefore not surprising that the bulk of the literature about domestic work focuses on females performing cleaning, cooking and care work. What’s missing in debates about domestic workers’ job-related experiences and relationships with their employers is the experiences of men performing domestic work, a job traditionally linked to femininity.
However, paid domestic work in South Africa hasn’t always been dominated by women. In the 1880s when the mining industry was being established in Johannesburg, black men, rather than women, were the preferred servants in white households. Known as houseboys, they cooked, cleaned, nursed and cared for white colonial families.
But over the next decade the landscape of domestic work underwent significant changes. This was due to a few factors, among them:
a scarcity of labour in the mines, which drew black men away from domestic roles to join the mining sector
the increasing urbanisation of black women
racial stereotypes about black men as sexually aggressive or promiscuous.
A small proportion of men still work as domestic workers, however. Some are migrants. Due to South Africa’s relative stability and economic opportunities, there has been an increase in migration from countries like Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique since apartheid ended in 1994. The migrants come seeking education, employment and improved livelihoods. They rely on friends and family already in South Africa to find jobs.
While African migrant women from poor backgrounds often find work in domestic service or the hospitality sectors, most migrant men work as gardeners, painters or security guards. Some Malawian and Zimbabwean male migrants work as waiters or domestic workers, jobs that are traditionally associated with women.
Exploring unfamiliar territory
As a researcher of domestic work in South Africa, I noticed that few studies had focused on male migrants performing domestic work in South Africa. Consequently, such work is commonly viewed as an employment arrangement involving affluent female employers and black female domestic workers from marginalised backgrounds. The intersections of race, class and gender between employers and domestic workers often lead to unequal power relations and economic exploitation entrenched within the employment relationship.
In my study, I examined the experiences of migrant male domestic workers in Johannesburg, with the aim of shedding some light on their duties and working conditions.
A male Malawian domestic worker employed by an acquaintance referred me to other male domestic workers in Johannesburg. Interviews were conducted with six male Malawian and four male Zimbabwean domestic workers employed by affluent white employers in Johannesburg. All had been employed for more than five years.
Migrant men’s experiences add a new layer of complexity to the study of domestic work, where complex intersections of class, race and gender occur.
Migrant male domestic workers in South Africa
My study showed that domestic work offered a viable employment path for men.
They faced similar challenges to their female counterparts. These included long working hours, a paternalistic employer-employee dynamic, and a marginalised job status.
The respondents said they had an array of indoor and outdoor responsibilities. Indoors, their tasks encompassed cleaning and tidying their employers’ residences. They also handled laundry and ironing, alongside duties such as grocery shopping and meal preparation.
Outdoors, their responsibilities extended to garden maintenance, swimming pool upkeep, pet waste disposal, cleaning outdoor grilling areas (braais), and sweeping driveways. They were also entrusted with securing the homes and taking care of pets when their employers were away.
The daily life of male live-in domestic workers was much the same as live-in female domestic workers. The working day started at 06:30, preparing breakfast for employers. Once employers had left for work, they cleaned the house, prepared lunch, did laundry and attended to the garden.
The long working day often ended at 20:00 after dinner was prepared for employers. Most weekends were spent on additional piece jobs, working as gardeners or painters for others.
While the homes of employers were opulent, male domestic workers, just like their female counterparts, lived in small rooms in the back yard, hidden away from the employers’ gaze, as other researchers have also found. The one-room accommodation was often equipped with basic furniture, differing little from the squalid living quarters of domestic workers during apartheid.
The men said they considered their wages reasonable. They earned on average between R5,000 (US$260) and R8,000 (US$416) a month. This was much higher than the minimum wage of R4,067 (US$216) for a domestic worker working eight hours a day, five days a week in South Africa. Most said they could engage in wage negotiations, which enabled them to improve their wellbeing and that of their families.
None of the male domestic workers in this study had written employment contracts with their employers, or were members of a trade union, such as the South African Domestic Service and Allied Workers Union. Work contracts need to be renewed every few years, which is costly and time consuming. Job security is precarious.
The recurring issues of domestic work
In South Africa, domestic work continues to be associated with marginalised black individuals, perpetuating a historical and societal imbalance.
Paid domestic work continues to occupy a low-status position. No formal qualifications and little specialised expertise are required. Domestic workers’ contributions to the functioning of households are essential but frequently taken for granted, as other studies have also confirmed.
Despite the legislation, domestic workers work long hours and perform physically demanding work. While male domestic workers in this study could negotiate better working conditions and pay, others might not be successful, and might remain in a precarious working environment.
Job security is not assured, a vulnerability most migrant domestic workers experience.
Practical protection remains constrained. For instance, migrant domestic workers often encounter difficulties when seeking healthcare.
To safeguard this group from exploitation and elevate their overall livelihoods, regulators, enforcement agencies and trade unions must protect and recognise all domestic workers, including migrants, in South Africa.",Male domestic workers in South Africa – study sheds light on the experiences of Malawian and Zimbabwean migrants,politics
"Johannesburg and its surrounds, at the centre of the industrial heartland of South Africa, have been hit by severe water cuts. Water interruptions have been happening for years, but they have been scaled up dramatically in recent weeks. The deteriorating situation recently forced the Minister of Water and Sanitation, Senzo Mchunu, to intervene. On 27 September he announced a new initiative – “water-shifting”. The proposal has echoes of “load-shedding”, the term used for the planned power outages which have become a common feature of life for all South Africans. Anja du Plessis, a water management expert, explains the new water initiative.
When did water outages start, and what are the latest developments?
Freshwater challenges are a frequent occurrence in South Africa. These include increased pressure on the amount of freshwater available for use, unequal distribution and lack of access to clean water and sanitation services.
Gauteng province, the country’s economic hub, has not been spared. The water crisis has been driven by a number of factors:
the overall decay in the quality and state of water infrastructure – it is at risk of total collapse in some areas
droughts
alleged corruption, which has affected the functioning of municipalities and municipal treatment plants.
Read more: Cholera in South Africa: a symptom of two decades of continued sewage pollution and neglect
Neither the national nor regional water authorities have managed to find solutions to the water crisis. Rather, the situation has deteriorated. In the last few months some consumers, such as those living in the suburb of Brixton, west of central Johannesburg, have had dry taps for more than three weeks.
Water tankers have been brought in to provide supplies. But residents complain that these are unreliable and they don’t trust the quality of water. Some people use it only to bath and flush toilets, and buy bottled water for drinking and cooking.
Three weeks ago the national and regional water authorities announced a plan that would spread the impact of water cuts between communities. The term the politicians coined for the new measures is “water-shifting”.
What is ‘water-shifting’ and how will it work?
The plan is to begin “sharing” water to take the pressure off the worst affected areas. By and large, high-lying areas of the city have been the hardest hit.
The reason for this is that the distribution of water requires pressure, which comes from a water source – a reservoir or water tower. When pressure is lost within the system, high-lying areas are usually affected first as there is not enough pressure in the system to get the water to them.
Pressure is lost when reservoirs reach critically low levels. This can happen as a result of leakages, burst pipes, above-average water consumption or power outages which affect pump stations.
Any of these can lead to pressure decreasing at a rapid rate.
Read more: Power cuts in South Africa are playing havoc with the country's water system
Johannesburg’s water utility, Rand Water, plans to shift water from a reticulation system with sufficient pressure to a struggling system. The idea is to provide an equitable supply of water to municipal customers.
Rand Water will implement water-shifting as an interim measure to assist in the recovery of struggling reticulation systems. An implementation date has not been given.
But Johannesburg Water, which is responsible for supplying water to the city’s residents, needs to develop and present a water management plan to address the crisis.
Could this crisis have been avoided?
In short, yes. The Gauteng province metropolitan councils are perfect examples of the effects of poor water governance and management as well as lack of political will over the past two decades. This has led to a lack of investment and underfunding of bulk water and sanitation infrastructure.
The result is that the water infrastructure, from water supply to treatment, storage, water resources and management, has fallen into disrepair. Also at play is a lack of planning and management of growing water demands due to increased population, migration and expansion of settlements. The poor management and overall lack of water and sanitation delivery and services is another factor.
There have been frequent water cuts in the province over the past five years. An estimated 30% of the province’s residents reported frequent water interruptions in 2017/18, increasing to 33% in 2020/2021.
Johannesburg isn’t alone. The poor state of water infrastructure across the country has been an issue for many years.
A detailed account was set out by the South African Institution of Civil Engineering in 2022. It showed that the country’s water infrastructure had deteriorated to the point that it was at risk of failing. The report called for prompt action to avoid severe water supply shortages.
Unfortunately, this wasn’t heeded.
Other factors have contributed to the water crisis too.
Firstly, there’s been continuous high consumption by consumers, partly due to increased temperatures. The province’s residents consume an estimated 300 litres (which includes water losses) each a day, compared to the global average of 173 litres.
Another factor has been the amount of water being lost. In Johannesburg, for example, a minimum of 41% of treated potable water supplied by Rand Water to Johannesburg Water is lost before it even reaches the consumer. This is referred to as non-revenue water by the municipality. Water is primarily lost through leakages and bursting pipes, attributed to poor operation and maintenance.
Is ‘water-shifting’ a solution?
The Minister of Water and Sanitation has made it clear that this is an interim measure.
But even as an interim measure it will require a high level of political will as well as technical expertise to work.
“Water-shifting” should not be a permanent measure or become the norm as it does not address the cause of the current crisis. Potable water will still be lost through leaking and burst pipes.
Relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Water and Sanitation, Rand Water and municipalities such as the City of Johannesburg need to stop the blame game and work together to address the primary causes of the water challenges, instead of the symptoms. The dilapidated state of water infrastructure needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to avoid water rationing.",Johannesburg has been hit by severe water shortages: new plan to manage the crisis isn’t the answer,politics

These members collectively account for about 85% of global economic output, more than 75% of global trade and about two-thirds of the world population. The AU’s 55 member states, on the other hand, bring only about 3% of global economic output, but a population of 1.4 billion.
Based on my research on the AU, and my experience as an adviser to the African Union Commission (the AU’s secretariat) for 18 years, my view is that membership of the G20 is an important complement to the union’s existing multilateral and bilateral strategic partnerships.
The AU hopes to use its G20 membership to give member states a greater voice on key global issues and to make a stronger contribution to the ongoing renegotiation of the global order. But a major challenge will be to find a structured way to arrive at common African positions and speak on behalf of member states.
Strategic partnership
The AU has developed its external relations primarily through multilateral and bilateral strategic partnerships.
Multilaterally, strategic partnerships with the United Nations and the EU are of key importance (the League of Arab States plays less of a role). Bilaterally, China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey are currently considered key strategic partners. And last year, the African Union Commission participated in the United States-Africa Leaders summit.
There is no routine process through which states are categorised as strategic partners. And to date the AU has struggled to develop a coherent policy for managing these partnerships. However, being a full member of the G20 now opens up the possibility to take collective African positions on strategic questions to the global table.
The continental concerns it can raise include debt relief, trade integration, financing the management of climate change and public health management.
The African Union and the global order
However, in the major global policymaking forums, member states of the AU don’t speak with one voice. This holds true for the UN General Assembly (as the African vote on Russia’s war against Ukraine demonstrates). And often also for the so-called A3 – the three African non-permanent members of the UN Security Council (Gabon, Ghana and Mozambique).
Yet, in a limited number of policy fields, the AU has managed to come up with what it refers to as “common positions”. These have been created and legitimised in different ways, and have a mostly diffuse legal binding effect on member states.
The most prominent of these common positions is the 2005 Ezulwini consensus on reform of the UN Security Council to increase African representation in the council and provide the continent with two permanent seats with veto rights. But there are also common positions on other important global questions. These include mining, the post-2015 development agenda and asset recovery from illicit financial flows.
Read more: Pan-Africanism remains a dream: four key issues the African Union must tackle
The African Union Commission needs a clear definition of what “common positions” are, and how they can be achieved politically and domesticated legally by member states.
To develop more common positions, the 55 AU member states would have to delegate more state sovereignty to the union. There are some lessons from the EU’s experience. The EU has developed more than 300 common positions. These have been adopted by the EU Council and approved by the EU Parliament. In these cases, the union’s member states have ceded real sovereignty to the EU Commission.
It will be interesting to see how the AU will prepare African positions to be tabled to the G20. They will likely be prepared by the continental body’s ministerial specialised technical committees. In the G20 realm, I expect the committee on finance, monetary affairs, economic planning and integration to play a strong role. This will likely be in cooperation with the technical committee on economic development, tourism, trade, industry and mining.
However, the legal way in which member states can express their agreement or disagreement with common positions needs to be defined.
What next
Membership in the G20 represents a great opportunity. But Africa’s attempts to speak with one voice must be strengthened. And coordination processes must be created at the level of finance ministers and central bank governors, among others. These will ensure that the AU makes use of its membership in a global negotiating and decision-making platform.",AU and G20: membership will give Africa more say on global issues – if it speaks with one voice,politics
"Domestic trials of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are considered quicker, cheaper and more responsive to victims’ needs than the International Criminal Court’s trials in The Hague.
But prioritising domestic accountability for the most serious crimes has both advantages and disadvantages.
In a recently published book, International Criminal Tribunals and Domestic Accountability: In The Court’s Shadow, I analyse the complex relationship between international and domestic accountability initiatives. I also look at how an ongoing shift from international to domestic trials has impacted the global fight against impunity.
I drew on the experiences of three African countries – the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and Sierra Leone. I argue that national justice systems are likely to be the primary forum for trials of serious crimes in the foreseeable future. However, there’s a growing tendency to romanticise what can be accomplished at the national level. Meanwhile, the ability of international criminal tribunals to serve the wider cause of human rights is being downplayed.
Going forward, I hope to spur a more nuanced conversation about how international and domestic justice should work together.
Domestic justice
International criminal justice is still associated with high-profile cases. One of these is the International Criminal Court’s recent arrest warrant against Russian president Vladimir Putin.
However, national courts now prosecute far more people for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. This is true for most countries. Whether it be in the DRC, Ukraine or Colombia, the International Criminal Court plays a backup role. And it’s had only a handful of convictions over 20 years.
Read more: Putin and the ICC: history shows just how hard it is to bring a head of state to justice
This is one of the reasons that domestic justice is now celebrated as quicker, cheaper and more victim-friendly. Just two decades after the International Criminal Court was created, many stakeholders now argue that “the future of international criminal justice is domestic”.
To better understand the relationship between international and domestic trials, I studied three African cases. I analysed the International Criminal Court’s work in the DRC, the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
Drawing on more than 200 interviews with civil servants, magistrates, diplomats and civil society representatives, I assessed what kind of “shadow effects” the three international tribunals had on prosecutions of serious crimes at the national level.
My findings confirm that the pursuit of accountability for serious crimes is complex. One shouldn’t expect quick and simple fixes when thousands of people suffer serious human rights violations. But based on 30 years of international criminal justice interventions on the African continent, I identified four trends. These reveal opportunities and challenges in the global fight against impunity.
Trends shaping international interventions
First, the numbers illustrate the declining importance of international trials. The Rwanda and Yugoslav tribunals indicted hundreds of people starting in the mid-1990s. Sierra Leone’s special court prosecuted 13 suspects in the 2000s. Today, the International Criminal Court handles between one and four international cases per country.
Second, with international criminal tribunals facing criticism in the 1990s and 2000s, the international community shifted attention to state-level accountability processes. As the number of international trials decreased, domestic prosecutions increased in some countries. But the track record is mixed. Hundreds of national trials in Rwanda and the DRC can be contrasted with the (near) absence of cases in Sierra Leone.
Read more: Prosecution or compensation? What Kenyan choices tell us about international justice
Third, there’s still little evidence that domestic justice performs better than international criminal tribunals. Donors and NGOs increasingly prioritise capacity-building initiatives for national magistrates and attorneys. But they avoid the political dimensions of state-led justice efforts. The difficult questions they need to address include: why are some perpetrators prosecuted domestically but not others? Which national trials are unfair? What effects do selective national prosecutions have on nation-building?
For instance, hundreds of trials before Congolese mobile courts are rightly celebrated. But the Congolese army has used international support to consolidate its power at the expense of the civilian justice sector. Scholars have expressed similar concerns about the unintended consequences of Rwanda’s domestic justice process.
Fourth, the International Criminal Court was expected to encourage a domestic reckoning with serious crimes by casting a “positive shadow” over national judges, prosecutors and attorneys. Instead, international prosecutors and judges in The Hague have often adopted risk-averse readings of their powers. And they have often ignored the work – good and bad – of their domestic counterparts. This practice may promote selective national prosecutions that entrench the (authoritarian) power of ruling elites in countries like the DRC, Central African Republic, Libya or Mali.
Way forward
There are two main takeaways. First, international criminal tribunals sometimes unintentionally cast an “authoritarian shadow” over domestic justice efforts. Second, too much emphasis on national trials may promote illiberal tendencies in some contexts. I encourage a more critical look at how international and domestic justice relate to one another. Simple formulas like “the future of international criminal justice is domestic” don’t always help.
But the book is an appeal for action rather than despair. It proposes strategies to overcome obstacles to domestic accountability. These include greater civil society engagement, cooperation with domestic law enforcement actors and trial monitoring.
Ultimately, the global fight against impunity remains a work in progress. The search for a balance between international and domestic accountability efforts will require further study.",The global approach to serious crimes is shifting to domestic trials – here’s what I found in three African countries,politics
"In 2011, pirates carried out 212 attacks in a vast area spanning Somali waters, the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, actions that the World Bank said cost the world economy US$18 billion a year.
Armed pirates hijacked ships as far away as 1,000 nautical miles from the Somali coast. They held the ships and crews for ransom. The World Bank estimates that Somali pirates received more than US$400 million in ransom payments between 2005 and 2012.
The piracy problem appeared unsolvable. Anti-piracy naval missions undertaken by the world’s most formidable navies, and self-protection measures adopted by the shipping industry, didn’t seem to work. It was, therefore, generally held that the solution lay ashore: major state-building in Somalia to remove the root causes of piracy.
The only problem was that no one was willing to undertake such a mission in the wake of America’s failures in Afghanistan and Iraq.
And then there was an astonishing turnaround. The number of attacks fell to 10 in 2012 and only two ships were hijacked between 2013 and 2023.
For three decades, I have conducted research on international diplomacy, military strategy, use of force and peacebuilding. Together with a colleague specialising in military strategy, I analysed the Somali piracy case. Academics and practitioners agree that four factors interacted to stop the pirates:
the conduct and coordination of several anti-piracy naval operations by the world’s most capable navies, including all five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China
the implementation of costly self-protection measures, not least the use of armed guards, by most flag states and shipping owners
development of a comprehensive legal toolbox enabling pirate prosecution and imprisonment
regional capacity-building making it possible to imprison pirates regionally and in Somalia.
Read more: Lift for maritime sector in Kenya and Djibouti after fall in piracy
The surprising thing is not that the four measures on their own proved sufficient to stop Somali piracy. What makes the Somali case special is the international community’s ability to agree to them and pay for their implementation.
The Somali case is important because it’s one of the few success stories in recent years where the use of limited force contributed to a sustainable outcome. Further, Somali pirates were stopped even though the conditions onshore in Somalia didn’t improve in any major way.
Collective action
Theoretically, the international community’s collective effort shouldn’t have happened because safety from piracy is a costly public good.
This means that it’s very expensive to provide but no one can be prevented from enjoying it once it has been produced. The result is a collective action problem that’s rarely overcome in international politics. Most actors prefer to free-ride rather than contribute to the production of the public good.
With respect to Somali piracy, all states and shipping owners had an incentive to leave it to others to solve the problem for them. The implementation of the four factors was very expensive for the states contributing to naval operations, and for shipowners who had to pay for self-protection measures, including hiring of armed guards.
Our study sought to understand how and why the collective action problem was overcome. The hope was to learn something that could help with overcoming similar problems in the future.
What worked
We found that three factors explain why the amount of free-riding was minimised in the Somali case.
The first was that the Somali pirates attacked ships belonging to all five permanent members of the UN Security Council and all the major shipping companies. This induced France to take the lead in military action against the pirates. The US subsequently led with respect to formulating a comprehensive strategy to implement the four factors presented earlier.
The involvement of European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) in the anti-piracy naval operations made it hard for member states not to contribute. A total of 18 member states contributed ships. China and Russia supported the American-led strategy and launched their own naval operations because their ships were attacked as well.
Second, the US established an institution, the Contact Group on Somali Piracy, tailor-made to formulate and implement a broad anti-piracy strategy. The US handpicked who would lead various working groups so that it contained all the actors – state and non-state – that were required to implement the necessary measures. These actors provided the expertise and the material resources required to implement the four factors presented earlier.
Third, the Somalia federal government and federal member states cooperated closely with anti-piracy efforts. They allowed the use of force against pirates in its national waters and on land. Somali authorities also cooperated with respect to the construction and running of pirate prisons paid for by international donors. This made it possible to overcome the piracy problem without engaging in the major state-building operation that had generally been viewed as a necessary condition for success when the piracy problem peaked in 2011.
Shared interests
Unfortunately, this success story will be hard to replicate. Somali piracy aligned great power, as well as private sector, regional and local state interests to an unusual degree. This is, for example, not the case in the Gulf of Guinea off the west African coast. Here, local states are less cooperative with respect to tackling piracy than Somali governmental actors were.
It’s also not the case with respect to tackling the coups in west Africa, where Russia, the three western members of the UN Security Council and regional states have conflicting interests.
It was the high degree of shared interests among the many actors involved that made the Somali anti-piracy campaign so effective.","Somali piracy, once an unsolvable security threat, has almost completely stopped. Here’s why",politics
"After about two months of wrangling between France and the new military regime in Niger, President Emmanuel Macron finally decided, on 24 September, to withdraw the French ambassador and pull out French military forces from Niger.
This was a U-turn. Only four weeks earlier, Macron had refused to follow the instructions of the putschists who’d ordered the ambassador and French forces to leave the country. He argued that he did not recognise the new junta, which took power on 26 July, and insisted that his forces would remain in the country.
As a scholar of politics and international relations, I have been exploring the security situation and the rise of insurgency in the Sahel for over a decade. In my view, France’s actions have created unnecessary uncertainty in a region already beset by insecurity from increasing jihadist activities, as well as six successful coups in the last three years.
In my opinion, France has made a strategic mistake. Though it did not recognise the junta, it should have maintained communication, especially after falling out with other former colonies such as Mali and Burkina Faso.
The other prominent external actor in Niger was the US. The US decided to negotiate with the junta. Unlike France, it did not label the military takeover a coup d'etat. The US resumed operations in some of its bases in Niger, having secured agreement from the junta.
Macron’s actions could have three negative outcomes for the region. It will hurt the fight against terrorism. It also opens the door to greater influence of Wagner, the Russian-backed mercenary group. And finally it has implications for Europe’s migrant crisis.
The fight against terrorism
Niger plays a significant role in the security architecture of the Sahel. The country is actively involved in and contributes to security organisations such as the G5 Sahel and the Multinational Joint Task Force.
These organisations are involved in the fight against terrorism in the region. Apart from contributing funds to both organisations, especially the G5 Sahel, France is also involved in training Nigerien forces and flying reconnaissance and attack drones, actively combating terrorists in the region.
The decision by France to pull out of Niger will have an impact on counter terrorism operations in the region. France has been involved there for a long time and has soldiers who thoroughly understand the region. Losing these officers will create a gap that Niger might struggle to fill in the short term.
Like France, the US also has a large military presence in Niger, where it operates its largest drone base in Africa. I have previously analysed the importance and security implications of the drone base to the region.
For its part, the EU also contributes to the security of the region by providing funding for the G5 Sahel and Multinational Joint Task Force. This momentum must be sustained in order not to lose what has already been achieved in the form of an established security architecture.
The withdrawal of French forces will negatively affect the morale of the soldiers in the security alliance and embolden insurgent groups. An increase in terrorist attacks has been recorded since the coup.
Russia versus the US
The terms of the agreement between the US and the military junta were not published. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to assume that one of Washington’s reasons for making sure it remained in Niger was the fear that it might lose the country to Russia.
In Mali, the military junta replaced French troops with Wagner forces. Since 2022, Russia has gained influence through the Wagner Group after the exit of France.
Washington would want to avoid losing further ground to Russian influence. With the Wagner group already present in Mali, there is suspicion that the recently signed military pact between the three countries (Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso) could expand the presence of the group.
In addition, the US has invested heavily in the Sahel, especially in Niger. In the last decade the US has invested hundreds of millions of dollars on security infrastructure, including a drone base in Agadez (central Niger).
The US understands the role “ungoverned spaces” in the Sahel could play in breeding terrorism. Such was the case of the regions between Pakistan and Afghanistan where Al-Qaeda launched attacks against the US and its western allies.
What it means for migration
Other major players in Niger such as the European Union also cannot afford to follow the path of France. The EU needs stability in Niger to stem trafficking and avoid another humanitarian catastrophe as seen in 2015-16. Europe witnessed the highest number of migrants transiting through Niger and Libya into Europe during this period.
There is no doubt that the civilian regimes of presidents Mahamadou Issoufou and Mohamed Bazoum contributed to the reduction in the flow of migrants through Niger to Libya. While serving as interior minister, Bazoum was instrumental in passing a law against people smuggling through Niger. The law was championed by Bazoum but also believed to have contributed to his ousting by the military. The junta could threaten to cancel the agreement and look the other way as migrants again transition through Niger into the EU.
The EU needs to maintain a strong diplomatic channel with the junta to maintain stability, prevent an increase in smuggling and continue efforts towards the return of democratic order.
Next steps
While I understand that increased diplomacy with the junta cements its authority, I think foreign powers should accept that there is a government in Niger that has some degree of popularity among the citizens. Frozen channels of diplomacy must be reactivated to prevent a total collapse of the Sahel’s security architecture and in order to achieve a quick transition to democracy.",France’s decision to leave Niger was a bad move: three reasons why,politics
"Flags have been flying at half mast in Ghana in tribute to Theresa Kufuor, the wife of John Agyekum Kufuor, president of Ghana from 2000 to 2008. Born Theresa Mensah, the former first lady passed away on 1 October at the age of 87.
As a scholar of political science and international relations I followed her public career with keen interest.
In my considered view, Theresa Kufuor in her own unique way transcended the ceremonial role of first lady and quietly exercised considerable political power in the Ghanaian political arena. She also endeared herself to Ghanaians through her self-effacing and unobtrusive style.
She will be remembered for devoting herself to national development and to steering the country through turbulent waters.
Who was Theresa Kufuor?
Theresa Kufuor was born on 25 October 1935 in Wenchi, a town in the Bono region of Ghana. She was the youngest sister of Ghanaian statesman and politician J.H. Mensah, point man for the remarkable seven-year development plan set out after independence by the country’s first president. She studied as a registered general nurse in London and qualified as a state certified midwife.
Her marriage in 1962 to Kufuor after meeting him a year earlier in London at a dance seemed natural, given that Kufuor served as deputy foreign minister in a government in which her brother (J.H. Mensah) was a more senior official.
Kufuor’s political rise to the Ghanaian presidency in 2000 brought Theresa more directly into the often acrimonious world of Ghanaian politics. Kufuor set about delicately trying to uproot all vestiges of the Rawlings era, with his wife by his side. She seemed to take it all in her careful stride, with her taciturn, reserved, behind the scenes approach.
A 19-year rule (the first part of which was rather bloody) had come to an end and Theresa Kufuor came across as just the right first lady to help navigate a sensitive and difficult change of the political guard.
She proved up to the task. Her well cultivated public persona in key aspects had a calming effect on the nation and its politics. Her sartorial style was less gaudy and very conservative compared with her predecessors. Her speeches were not meant to rally the troops to battle; she simply spoke to the nation with impeccable diction and a rather quaint British accent which recalled colonial times long gone.
She was content to be the dutiful wife who helped the president steer the Ghanaian ship of state to a safe berth in choppy waters. Tapping into her training as a nurse, she made it clear her sole focus was social matters affecting Ghanaian women; she had no pretensions of setting up political machinery to help her husband’s electoral fortunes.
She was a devout Catholic. She was also a strong advocate for a free compulsory universal basic education programme for kindergarten children, as part of the government’s educational reforms in 2007.
Ghana’s first ladies
Fathia Nkrumah, wife of Kwame Nkrumah, was the first of postcolonial Ghana’s first ladies. She held a special fascination for Ghanaians – because of who she was, rather than what she did. She was the niece of the noted Egyptian pan-Arabist advocate and leader Gamal Abdul Nasser.
After 1966 a more activist, even militant, Ghanaian first lady emerged in the person of Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings. Nana Konadu pursued far reaching civic, social and economic ventures to better the lot of Ghanaian women and children. However, describing her as “first lady” in the revolutionary years of 1981-1992 was technically a misnomer, given that her husband, then military ruler Jerry Rawlings, was not an executive president.
This anomaly was fixed with the elections of 1992. The election of 2000 ended the rather ebullient Agyeman-Rawlings era. Theresa Kufuor was to follow as first lady. The contrast could not be greater.
Why she mattered
Ghana has celebrated its 30th year since a return to constitutional rule in 1993. Theresa Kufuor played her part in the still ongoing effort to build some of Ghana’s sorely needed social infrastructure for the welfare of women and children.
In her own way she spared no effort and in so doing provided an inspiring example of what it means to be a first lady and what to focus on.",Theresa Kufuor: Ghana’s former first lady was a quiet and unobtrusive champion of change,politics
"Former Malian footballer Salif “Domingo” Këita, who passed away on 2 September in Bamako, embodied a crucial moment in the history of African football, helping shape its relationship with the world. His influence was also felt in Europe, when he helped shine a light on the rights of French footballers at a critical time.
Born on 6 December 1946, the year that the French West African Cup was created, Keïta (not to be confused with Salif Keita the musician) was also an important leader in Malian football.
As a scholar of contemporary history, with research interests in the political, cultural and global history of football, I have followed Keïta’s career and believe that it’s as important to remember the man and the role he played as it is to remember the player.
Starting out
Salif Keïta grew up in Bamako, Mali, in a family of eight children. It wasn’t easy for him to make his father, a haulage contractor by trade, understand that he preferred football to his studies, even though he eventually qualified to work as a grinder. Football began as an informal activity, even before he started playing in his neighbourhood team in Bamako.
At just 14 he joined the Pionniers club, a product of a form of “progressive” scouting modelled on the socialist countries dear to President Modibo Keïta. His dribbling, shooting and heading skills soon propelled him into the Real Bamako squad. He played in and lost two African Champions League finals, one with Real and the other with Stade Malien, to whom he was loaned for the occasion. He also began to take his first steps in Mali’s national team.
Going to France
But Keïta was aiming higher than national fame. Through postcolonial networks, he came into contact with the directors of French club AS Saint-Etienne, who had good relations with Charles Dagher, a Lebanese trader from Bamako. In September 1967, Keïta was smuggled to Liberia, then flew from there to Orly in France. The directors of the “Greens” (AS Saint-Etienne’s nickname) were not at the airport to meet him and so a young Keïta hailed a taxi to take him straight to the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium.
Read more: The fighting spirit of young African footballers who migrate overseas
Keïta was not the first African player to be recruited by a French club. However, the door that was initially opened to footballers from sub-Saharan Africa in the 1950s had partly closed again. On one hand, African federations wanted to keep their players. On the other hand, the number of foreigners playing for French teams was limited to just two. The Malian football federation would accept his sneaking out of the country and the following November sent him a transfer certificate, the key to his playing rights. But even so, at the time French clubs preferred to sign South American or Yugoslavian players.
They offered African footballers harsh contracts and Keïta initially played as an amateur and not a professional, justified by the club’s managers by the fact that he was studying law in France. He was nevertheless paid, eventually signing a four-year professional contract in 1969.
Triumphs on the field
Even though the winter in Forez, in the Massif Central region of France, was harsh, Keïta quickly made a name for himself. At first, he could count on the advice of coach Albert Batteux and the assistance of Rachid Mekhloufi, an Algerian player for the Greens. Playing as a centre forward, Keïta scored 120 goals in 149 matches. In October 1969, he scored the winner against Bayern Munich in the Champions Cup Round of 16.
With AS Saint-Etienne, he won three French league titles and a French Cup. In 1970, his performances earned him the first African Ballon d'Or award. Eager for a change of scenery, he sought to terminate his contract. This led to a bitter legal dispute with Roger Rocher, the president of AS Saint-Etienne.
Suspended for six months, but supported by many fans, Keïta signed with a new club, Olympique de Marseille, in November 1972. Once again he found himself up against the demands of club directors, who wanted to have him naturalised so that they could field him alongside two foreign but European stars, Josip Skoblar and Roger Magnusson. But Keïta refused what he saw as an attack on his dignity as an African man. He became the subject of a local press cabal’s criticisms, with strong racist undertones.
Taking on the world
Keïta then moved to Valencia from 1973 to 1975, where Alfredo Di Stefano had brought him. Spain was not yet the paragon of the beautiful game, but Keïta’s strikes kept finding the net again – until he was injured in March 1975. At that point, Valencia wanted to transfer him in order to recruit someone else. True to form, he defended his sporting and financial interests and only agreed to leave on condition that he was paid the year’s wages due to him and that the club paid its taxes.
Keïta went on to win the Portuguese league as the country began making a name for itself in world football thanks to its stars of African origin – like Keïta, Eusebio and Mario Coluna. At the age of 31, with the club Sporting Lisbon, he finally found an environment in which he could flourish. He won a Portuguese Cup, before playing a final season in the US from 1979 to 1980.
Back home
Keïta retired just as African football was beginning to reveal itself to the world. His life inspired director Cheik Doukouré’s 1994 film The Golden Ball, in which he played the role of a coach.
Read more: The precarious fate of African footballers in Europe after their game ends
Back home in Mali, he worked as minister delegate to the minister in charge of private initiatives. After the fall of Moussa Traoré, Keïta opened a football training centre in Bamako. He was then elected president of the Mali Football Federation, serving from 2005 until 2009.
But France has not forgotten him. The directors of Saint-Etienne elevated him to the rank of ambassador for the club and two stadiums bear his name – in Saint-Etienne and Cergy-Pontoise. This was their way of honouring a great striker and a man determined to assert his rights in an environment still marked by a certain condescension towards Africa.","Salif Keïta, the defiant Malian football legend who created history on and off the field",arts + culture
"The deaths of three members of the South African Navy (SA Navy) on 20 September 2023, when a freak wave swept them off the deck of the submarine SAS Manthatisi, has put the spotlight on the organisation and its work. André Wessels is a military historian; his latest book is A Century of South African Naval History: The South African Navy and its Predecessors 1922-2022. The Conversation Africa asked him for insights.
How big is South Africa’s navy? How does it compare?
The South African Navy has always been one of the strongest naval forces in sub-Saharan Africa.
Egypt has the strongest navy in Africa, and Algeria is the second strongest as it has been steadily building up its naval forces. The Moroccan navy is also strong, as is the Nigerian navy, which has acquired a large number of naval vessels, mostly patrol ships and smaller patrol craft.
Thanks to its submarine capabilities, the SA Navy can be regarded as one of the strongest on the continent. However, with its present ten “major” warships, the SA Navy is not in the same league as, for example, Brazil (about 100 ships), Russia (550), India (250) and China (600).
According to sources that are in the public domain, the SA Navy at the moment has three submarines, four frigates, one multi-mission inshore patrol vessel (with another to be commissioned in the near future, and a third under construction), one survey ship (with a new one under construction), one combat support ship, and a number of smaller craft (most of them in reserve). In terms of its number of warships, this is the smallest that the navy has been since the mid-1950s.
Read more: Money has little to do with why South Africa's military is failing to do its job
Severe financial restrictions have put its capabilities under strain. For example, it has had to curtail anti-piracy patrols (“Operation Copper”) in the Mozambique Channel due to the unavailability of ships.
Can it protect the country’s territorial waters?
Submarines provide South Africa with a crucial deterrent potential. And the navy can also do patrol work with its surface vessels (if they are able to go to sea). But it has a limited anti-submarine warfare capability, and is not able to project much power across long distances.
The government needs to gradually increase defence spending from the present less than 1% of GDP to at least 1.8%, which is what countries globally on average spend on defence. That will enable the navy to increase training opportunities, send more ships out to sea, and perhaps even acquire much-needed larger offshore patrol vessels.
South Africa is a maritime state, given that all its borders are on the ocean bar its northern one. The country needs a small but well-equipped navy that can defend it, underpin its diplomatic efforts, and assist other state departments in various ways.
What’s its role?
Geographically South Africa is a large peninsula on the strategic Cape sea route. Some 90% of its trade flows through its harbours. The navy must assist in ensuring the integrity of the country as an independent state, by patrolling its territorial waters and acting as a deterrent against foreign military aggression and maritime crime. Its core business is “to fight at sea”, with its official mission “to win at sea”. Its vision is
to be unchallenged at sea.
The navy can also play a role in humanitarian relief operations, search-and-rescue operations and peace support operations.
In the course of its history, the SA Navy has performed these and many other tasks. For example, in 1993 it facilitated the sending of a mobile hospital and relief supplies to Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Gift of the Givers, the disaster response NGO. The navy has also helped provide food and medical aid to countries ravaged by conflict or drought, for example when the combat support ship SAS Drakensberg took supplies to Bangladesh in 1991. The navy has also rescued the crew members of many yachts that have been caught in storms or were in need of other assistance off the South African coast and elsewhere, for example during the 2014 Cape-to-Rio Transatlantic Yacht Race.
The navy is also responsible for hydrographic survey work along the South African coast. It maps the ocean floor so that reliable charts can be drawn up, making it safe for merchant and other ships to sail along the coast and visit ports.
In addition, the navy has an important diplomatic role in sending warships (“grey diplomats”) on flag-showing visits to other countries.
But under financial constraints, the navy has been hard-pressed to fulfil its obligations. For example, it has for several years not been able to take part in flag-showing visits to other countries because of the unavailability of ships. In general, less time has also been spent at sea.
What is the history of the SA Navy?
The navy can trace its history back to 1 April 1922, when the SA Naval Service was established. This became the Seaward Defence Force in 1939 when the Second World War broke out, and the SA Naval Forces in 1942. It played a small but important role in the Allied war effort against Nazi Germany, patrolling the South African coastal waters. It also sent warships to the Mediterranean and Far Eastern war zones.
On 1 January 1951, the Naval Forces were renamed the SA Navy. In accordance with the Simon’s Town Agreement (1955), the navy acquired the Simon’s Town Naval Base from Britain (1957), and was strengthened by the acquisition of a number of destroyers, frigates, patrol boats and minesweepers, and later also a replenishment ship (1967) and three submarines (1970-1971).

But by then, the ruling National Party’s apartheid policy had led to South Africa’s growing international isolation. The United Nations’ mandatory arms embargo against the country (1977) had obvious detrimental consequences for the then South African Defence Force (SADF), and in particular the navy. For example, it did not receive the submarines and frigates that it had ordered from France.
In the meantime, the navy assisted the other arms of the defence force, in particular the SA Army’s Special Forces, during the Namibian war of independence, which spilled over into Angola. The navy’s submarines and strike craft, as well as other ships, assisted the South African Special Forces in operations “behind enemy lines”.
The end of this conflict in 1989, and of the freedom struggle in South Africa in 1994, led to a new dawn. On the eve of the 1994 elections the SADF was renamed the SA National Defence Force (SANDF).

"Aziz Goolam Pahad, who has died at the age of 82, was a South African anti-apartheid activist, politician and deputy minister of foreign affairs in the post-1994 government.
Together with a small group of foreign policy analysts, I worked with Aziz over the span of 30 years, shaping the post-apartheid South African government’s approach to international relations and its foreign policy. We spent countless hours debating foreign affairs and the numerous crises and challenges government had to face as a relative “newcomer” in continental African and global affairs.
Aziz was generous with giving his time to formulate positions that would allow for the unlocking of a crisis. He remained open to intellectual challenges throughout his career. He was a keen participant in academic research projects dealing with foreign policy.
He made a monumental contribution to the struggle against apartheid and colonial oppression in South Africa, the continent and the Middle East. And he contributed significantly to the development and execution of a progressive African-centred foreign policy doctrine. Sadly, towards the end of his career as a diplomat he witnessed the slow decline of South Africa’s stature and influence in global affairs.
The Mandela and Mbeki years
Under presidents Nelson Mandela (1994-1999) and Thabo Mbeki (1999-2008), South African diplomats who’d sharpened their skills during many years of exile became sought-after as facilitators and mediators. Under their guidance Africa converted the Organisation of African Unity into the African Union, and reset relations with the international community via the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.
South African diplomats were articulate and visible in the corridors of the United Nations and in gatherings such as the Group of 7, Group of 20 and the Non-Aligned Movement. They were able to advance Africa’s quest for peace and development. In Africa, political and security crises, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and Burundi, were given attention.

However this “golden era” of South Africa’s foreign policy, as fellow scholar Chris Landsberg calls it, was unable to withstand the corroding effects of foreign meddling in African affairs. Neither could it withstand the grand corruption which reached its apogee in South Africa under former president Jacob Zuma (May 2009 - February 2018).
Preparatory years
Aziz was born on 25 December 1940 in the former Transvaal, the current North West province in South Africa. His parents were Amina and Goolam Pahad, activists in the Transvaal Indian Congress, a political organisation established in the early 1900s by Mahatma Gandhi and others. The congress became involved in the broader anti-apartheid struggle in later years. His elder brother, Essop, also became an activist. Essop passed away in July.
In 1963, Aziz completed a degree in sociology and Afrikaans at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. As an activist, he was served with a banning order and arrested on several occasions. After the Rivonia Trial from 1963 to 1964, in which ten leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) were tried for sabotage designed to overthrow the apartheid system of racial oppression, he and Essop left South Africa and went into exile.
Aziz spent some time in Angola and Zimbabwe but lived mostly in London. He completed a master’s degree in politics and international relations at the University of Sussex. He worked full-time for the exiled ANC and supported the development of the Anti-Apartheid Movement.
Even before his return to South Africa in 1990, he contributed to the transition from apartheid to democracy, a role well described in his book Insurgent Diplomat: Civil Talks or Civil War?.
Aziz worked closely with Thabo Mbeki, at the time head of the exiled ANC’s international relations department, and a small team of academics in formulating the ANC’s position on foreign policy. The paper formed part of preparations by the ANC and its alliance partners, the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, for governing the country.

The foreign policy paper provided a broad roadmap for diplomats post-apartheid. It eventually shaped government’s more formal foreign policy of 2011, entitled Building a Better World: The Diplomacy of Ubuntu. In the mid-1990s, Aziz was instrumental in the establishment, with support from the German government, of an ANC-aligned think-tank called the Foundation of Global Dialogue, run by foreign policy expert and academic Garth le Pere and myself. It lives on as the Institute of Global Dialogue, based at the University of South Africa.
Role in government
Following the victory of the ANC in South Africa’s first democratic election in 1994, Aziz was elected to parliament. From there, he was appointed by President Mandela as deputy minister of foreign affairs. He was re-elected to parliament in 1999 and 2004, and kept his position as deputy minister of foreign affairs  throughout the Mandela and Mbeki presidencies.
Holding the post for 14 years meant that he was able to create and nurture a wide network of political, academic and diplomatic connections. This enabled him to play an unassuming but key mediating and facilitation role dealing with major crises on the continent and beyond.
But Aziz also showed his activist roots when he spoke out against the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Nato-led invasion of Libya and assassination of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. He supported the Palestinian struggle for recognition over many decades.
Aziz resigned from government and parliament in 2008, shortly after Mbeki was removed as president of the ANC in 2007.
The ‘diplomat-scholar’
In retirement, Aziz remained active as a “diplomat-scholar”. He played a prominent role, with his brother Essop, in a small but influential think-tank, the Concerned Africans Forum. In 2015 he headed the short-lived South African Council on International Relations.
The council was established by the government as a body of experts and a sounding board for senior decision-makers. However, its semi-autonomous identity brought it into conflict with the ruling party’s foreign affairs structures. Politicians allowed it to wither away.
In 2018 the administration of President Cyril Ramaphosa asked Aziz to lead a commission of experts to review South Africa’s international relations. In a sad repeat of the council’s demise, the commission was never given a proper hearing and its value remains untapped.

This is perhaps illustrative of the reality of policy-making in dynamic settings such as South Africa’s foreign affairs. The essence of Aziz’s contribution to a progressive African-oriented worldview was ultimately ignored by the foreign policy mandarins.

"Saudi Arabia and Israel had seemingly been edging closer to a landmark deal to normalize their diplomatic relations – and then the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, happened.
Since then, thousands have died in Gaza and in Israel. And fears of the conflict spreading across the region form the backdrop to frenzied diplomacy across the region, including a visit to Israel by U.S. President Joe Biden on Oct. 18.
It also threatens to undermine a key pillar of Saudi Arabia’s foreign and domestic agenda: the “de-risking” of the region. With Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman set on implementing “Vision 2030” – an ambitious economic, social and cultural program – and developing the kingdom as a destination for tourism and investment, a renewal of regional instability is the last thing the crown prince needs.
De-escalating tensions
Certainly, the escalating violence in the Middle East presents a challenge to the shift toward de-escalation of tensions across much of the broader region in recent years.
This has included the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020, which established diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. But it goes further, including multiple-state treaties that have healed rifts across the Gulf, culminating in the signing of a deal in March 2023 to restore Saudi-Iranian relations.
These diplomatic breakthroughs opened up a space for greater regional cooperation through initiatives such as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor unveiled at the G20 meeting in India in September 2023.
The hope of officials across the region was that economic development could integrate the region and move discussion away from the failure to make progress on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian issue.
The Palestinian question
Violence in Israel and Gaza threatens to knock Gulf states off a delicate balancing act of supporting the Palestinian cause in front of their largely Muslim populations while also making overtures to Israel and the U.S.
Qatar, for example, has long hosted the political leaders of Hamas while remaining on friendly terms with the U.S.. It will now likely face significant Israeli and U.S. pressure to expel Hamas leadership.
The UAE and Bahrain both normalized relations with Israel in 2020, along with Morocco. But public support for the Abraham Accords across the region was always lukewarm at best and may now dwindle away.
Meanwhile, Dubai, the UAE’s largest city, is gearing up to host COP28, the international climate change conference, starting Nov. 30. The UAE will not want the event overshadowed or put at risk by a new regional war.
Reaching out to Israel
But nowhere is the tightrope more delicate than in Saudi Arabia. This is by virtue of the kingdom’s religious standing in the Islamic world – it is custodian of the faith’s two most holy sites, Mecca and Medina – and the ambitious raft of economic reforms the kingdom has rolled out as part of Vision 2030.
The campaign for Palestinian statehood has long been a cause célèbre in the Muslim world, and the current king of Saudi Arabia, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, has been a staunch supporter of Palestine all his life.
But his son and heir, the crown prince, has increasingly shown an interest in dialogue with Israel. This has culminated in the talks to “normalize” relations between the two countries – something that would represent a historic breakthrough in Israel’s acceptance within the Arab and Islamic world. As recently as Sept. 20, Crown Prince Mohammed told Fox News that “every day, we get closer” to a deal.
Indeed, a series of leaks to U.S. media in the days and weeks prior to the Hamas attack suggested that the outlines of an agreement were taking shape, driven by the Biden administration.
Public shows, private diplomacy
But the Hamas attack and Israel’s response have punctured this momentum. Saudi sources briefed the media on Oct. 13 that talks on normalization had been paused – but not abandoned.
Such messaging is in line with Saudi attempts to balance domestic and external interests. An initial Saudi Foreign Ministry statement on Oct. 7 appealed to both the “Palestinian factions” and “Israeli occupation forces” to de-escalate. But at the first Friday prayer at the Grand Mosque in Mecca after the attacks, Saudi authorities were more forthcoming in taking sides, with the state-appointed cleric urging support for “our brothers in Palestine.”
Behind the public shows of support for Palestinians, there is evidence that Saudis are trying to spearhead diplomatic efforts to prevent the war between Israel ad Hamas from developing into a wider conflagration that might bring in Lebanon, Iran and others.
On Oct. 12, Crown Prince Mohammed discussed the unfolding developments in Israel and Gaza with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi – their first conversation since ties between the two countries were restored in March.
Three days later, the crown prince received U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Riyadh amid media reports of differences between the Saudi and U.S. positions on the conflict and the need for de-escalation.
Oil and foreign investment
Such diplomatic moves fall in line with the crown prince’s desire to “de-risk” the region. He is eager to see that nothing jeopardizes a series of “giga-projects” – such as Neom, the futuristic new city on the Red Sea coastline – that have become synonymous with Vision 2030.
The Saudi fear is that a prolonged or regional conflict will deter foreign investment in Vision 2030.
Foreign investment was seen as key to the project’s success. But levels of foreign investment plunged after the detention by the Saudi authorities of dozens of senior Saudi business figures at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2017 over allegations of corruption. Investors took fright at the prospect that their business partners might suddenly disappear or be shaken down.
As a result, the Saudis are having to shoulder a greater proportion of the costs of Vision 2030 themselves. This explains why Saudi officials have cooperated with their Russian counterparts in OPEC+ meetings to keep the price of oil at a level high enough to generate enough revenues to fund the projects.

Vision 2030 has become so bound up with Crown Prince Mohammed’s pledge to transform Saudi Arabia that he cannot afford for it to fail – hence his determination to reduce sources of regional tension, including with Iran.
Saudi officials also recently revised their plans to attract 100 million visitors a year by 2030 upward to 150 million and launched a bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup.
Underlying these initiatives is the Saudis’ desire to diversify the kingdom’s economy away from an overdependence on oil, turning the kingdom into a destination for capital and people alike. These ambitions would be endangered by another regional war in the Middle East – especially if it drew in Iran.
Playing the ‘normalization’ card
So where does the “normalization” of Saudi-Israeli relations go from here?
Putting the process on ice – for now – fits Crown Prince Mohammed’s careful balancing act. Proceeding at full speed would have risked blowback from other Arab and Middle Eastern states, undermining the process of “de-risking” of the region.
It also may provide Saudi Arabia with greater leverage – Israel and the U.S. will be keen that the current violence does not derail the process entirely.
So pausing the process, I argue, now makes tactical sense for Saudi Arabia, given the outpouring of anger in the Islamic world at developments in Gaza – and it provides the Saudi leadership with an opportunity to control the next phase of what remains an extremely delicate endeavor.",Saudi plans to ‘de-risk’ region have taken a hit with Gaza violence − but hitting pause on normalization with Israel will buy kingdom time,politics
"Political observers, most Americans and even members of Congress can’t remember a battle for the post of speaker of the U.S. House as fraught as the one that began back in January 2023 and continues still, 10 months later.
On Jan. 7, California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy finally became speaker after 15 rounds of voting. But on Oct. 3, he was ousted. On Oct. 17 and again on Oct. 18, Ohio Republican Jim Jordan came up short in two rounds of voting to replace McCarthy.
The reason it’s so hard to recall a parallel is that there isn’t one – at least not since the 1850s, which saw a fight over the speakership that took nearly two months and 133 rounds of voting.
Along with all manner of other inauspicious “firsts” in American politics over the last few years – a violent attempt to overturn a presidential election in the halls of Congress and a former president being indicted for the attempt, to name just two – the century-long tradition of House speakers being quickly and unanimously elected by their party has been similarly blown to pieces.
It can be hard to understand what’s going on. But as a political scientist who co-authored a textbook called “Congress Explained,” I have an obligation to give it my best shot. Here are three of the most revealing elements of the ongoing speaker kerfuffle, and how political science can help people – including me – understand them.
1. Jordan’s attempts to win over his conference
For a member of Congress with a reputation as a far-right “attack dog,” Jordan has spent a lot of the past few days on what congressional experts like to call “herding cats” – leaders getting their rank-and-file party members in alignment for a vote, even when many of those members want different things.
To get members to go their way, party leaders in Congress frequently use a combination of offers and threats. They can, for example, offer rank-and-filers desired committee assignments or attention to their pet issues.
Alternatively, they can encourage – implicitly or explicitly – someone to challenge the member in a primary, or withhold fundraising support, which is a main responsibility of party leadership. So far, Jordan appears to have favored this more aggressive approach in what The New York Times called a “pressure campaign” to round up support from moderate members still unsure about him.
Whether the pressure tactics end up being enough for Jordan to become speaker is an open question. But if he does win the gavel, he’ll need to work even harder to win over his colleagues for impending budget negotiations and to deal with international crises in the Middle East and Ukraine. And fundraising promises or threats may not be enough.
2. The votes cast for non-Jordan Republicans
In a first round of voting on Oct. 17, Jordan fell short of the majority required to become speaker of the house. Not surprisingly, no Democrats backed him. But he also faced 20 Republican holdouts. Even more Republicans voted for someone else on Oct. 18. And those holdouts didn’t all vote for the same person. Who they did vote for can reveal a lot about the internal dynamics in the Republican Party.
Most of the Republican holdouts voted for either McCarthy or House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who as recently as last week was touted as McCarthy’s heir. Those members have been extensively quoted as having major problems not just with Jordan as a potential speaker but with the chaos introduced to the broader legislative process by far-right members like Jordan ally Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz.
Several Republicans from the New York delegation voted for someone who had first appeared to be a bit of a head-scratcher: New York Republican Lee Zeldin, who is no longer a member of Congress.
Although Zeldin – or any other person, even if they are not a member of the House – can be elected speaker under House rules, the votes cast in his direction were purely symbolic. But they were also telling.
These New York Republican representatives, many of whom come from districts won by Democratic President Joe Biden, are sending the message that they and other Republicans elected in competitive districts are the only reason Republicans have a majority in the House at all. They have a point: There is significant evidence that in the 2022 election, farther right candidates, particularly those who denied the outcome of the 2020 election, were less popular with voters than their moderate counterparts – and almost cost Republicans the House majority.
The votes for Zeldin, therefore, are a warning to fellow Republicans from the moderates in New York, insisting they not be taken for granted.
3. The floor action of Congress’ most extreme members
C-SPAN is not known for its exciting television, but political observers on Tuesday afternoon were treated to a few dramatic moments that – aside from their entertainment value – are emblematic of some of the larger dysfunction and political dynamics that have come to define both parties in recent years.
One instance came during California Democrat Pete Aguilar’s Oct. 17 nomination speech for Democratic speaker candidate Hakeem Jeffries of New York, in which Aguilar noted that Jordan has yet to pass a bill out of the chamber since 2007, when he was first sworn in.
California Democrat Pete Aguilar nominates Hakeem Jeffries and criticizes Jim Jordan.
In response, far-right Republican members Gaetz and Lauren Boebert of Colorado reportedly applauded.
According to the research, Aguilar is not wrong about Jordan’s reputation: The Center for Effective Lawmaking, an academic research center out of Vanderbilt University, ranks Jordan near the bottom of his Republican conference on a whole battery of figures measuring legislative effectiveness.
That doesn’t mean that Jordan can’t be an effective speaker. But the willingness of the party to nominate someone with such a thin record of achievement – and Gaetz’s and Boebert’s open enthusiasm for the comment about Jordan’s lack of action – is a monument to the increasingly obstructionist politics that continue to plague Congress.",House speaker paralysis is confusing – a political scientist explains what’s happening,politics
"As Israel prepares for a massive military operation against Hamas in Gaza, risks of an escalating regional conflict loom large. The most critical additional threat to Israel is from Hezbollah, the militant group and political party based across Israel’s northern border in Lebanon.
Hamas and Hezbollah are both backed by Iran and see weakening Israel as their primary raison d’etre. However, the two groups are not the same. Their differences will likely influence their actions – and Israel’s – in the days and weeks to come.
Unlike Hamas, Hezbollah has, to date, not gone to war purely for the Palestinian cause. That could change. Hezbollah has not yet fully entered the current conflict, but the group has exchanged fire with Israel, across the northern border with Lebanon. Meanwhile, Iran has said that an expansion of the war may be “inevitable”.
An Iranian protestor holds the Hezbollah flag during a pro-Palestinian march in Tehran on October 13 2023. Sipa US|Alamy
What is Hezbollah?
Named the “party of God”, Hezbollah bills itself as a Shia resistance movement. Its ideology is focused on expelling western powers from the Middle East and on rejecting Israel’s right to exist.
The group was founded in 1982 – in the middle of the 15-year Lebanese civil war – after Israel invaded Lebanon in retaliation for attacks perpetrated by Lebanon-based Palestinian factions. It was quickly backed by Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which supplied funding, weapons and training in an effort to expand Iranian influence in Arab states.
Hezbollah’s military force continued to develop after the Lebanese civil war came to an end in 1990, despite most other factions disarming. The group continued to focus on “liberating” Lebanon from Israel, and it engaged in years of guerrilla warfare against Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon until Israel’s withdrawal in 2000. Hezbollah then largely focused its operations on retaking the disputed border area of Shebaa Farms for Lebanon.
In 2006, Hezbollah engaged in a five-week war with Israel in an attempt to settle scores rather than with an aim to liberate Palestine. That conflict killed over 158 Israelis and over 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians.
From 2011, during the Syrian civil war, Hezbollah’s power grew further as its forces assisted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran, against mostly Sunni rebels. In 2021, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group had 100,000 fighters (though other estimates range between 25,000 and 50,000). It boasts a sophisticated military arsenal equipped with precision rockets and drones.
The group has also functioned as a political party in Lebanon and holds significant influence, often described as a “state within a state.” Eight members were first elected to the Lebanese parliament in 1992, and in 2018, a Hezbollah-led coalition formed a government.
Hezbollah retained its 13 seats at the 2022 election but the coalition lost its majority and the country currently has no fully functioning government. Other Lebanese parties accuse Hezbollah of paralysing and undermining the state and of contributing to Lebanon’s persistent instability.
What is Hamas?
“Hamas”, which translates literally as “zeal,” is an Arabic acronym for the “Islamic resistance movement”. The group was founded in 1987, in Gaza, as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, a prominent Sunni group based in Egypt.
Emerging during what’s known as the first intifada or uprising of Palestinians against Israeli occupation, Hamas quickly adopted the principle of armed resistance and called for the annihilation of Israel.
Palestinian politics shifted significantly after 1993’s Oslo accords, a series of agreements negotiated between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) with the aim of establishing a comprehensive peace agreement.
Opposed to the peace process, Hamas’s armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, established itself as the primary force of armed resistance against Israel. It launched a series of suicide bomb attacks that continued through the early years of the second intifada (2000-2005), before shifting to rockets as a primary tactic.
Like Hezbollah, Hamas operates as a political party. It won parliamentary elections in 2006, and in 2007, it gained control of the Gaza Strip in a bloody battle with rival party Fatah that left over 100 dead. Hamas has controlled Gaza ever since, showing little tolerance for political opposition. They have never held elections, and political opponents and critics are frequently arrested with reports of torture.
Over this time, Hamas’s armed wing has become increasingly sophisticated. Its arsenal now comprises thousands of rockets, including long-range missiles and drones.
How are Hamas and Hezbollah different?
Hamas has increasingly received funding, weapons and training from Iran, but it is not in Iran’s pocket to the same degree as Hezbollah, which is backed almost exclusively by Iran and takes its directives from the Islamic Republic.
What’s more, as a Sunni organisation, Hamas does not share the Shia religious link to Iran that characterises Hezbollah and most of Iran’s proxies. As a result, while Hamas no doubt benefits from Iran’s patronage, it tends to operate more independently than Hezbollah.
In contrast, Hamas has received support in the past from Turkey and Qatar, among others, and operates with relative autonomy. The group was also long at odds with Iran over their opposing stances in Syria.
Right now, this is very much a war between Israel and Hamas. Hezbollah remains, however, a threat to Israel. If activated by Iran, its full involvement would rapidly change the course of the conflict and likely open up a regional war.",Hamas and Hezbollah: how they are different and why they might cooperate against Israel,politics
"In the wake of the shocking invasion of southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to destroy Hamas.
“We are fighting a cruel enemy, worse than ISIS,” Netanyahu proclaimed four days after the invasion, comparing Hamas with the Islamic State group, which was largely defeated by U.S., Iraqi and Kurdish forces in 2017.
On that same day, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant went further, stating, “We will wipe this thing called Hamas, ISIS-Gaza, off the face of the earth. It will cease to exist.” They were strong words, issued in the wake of the horrific terrorist attack that killed more than 1,300 Israelis and culminated in the kidnapping of more than 150 people, including several Americans.
And in a telling comparison, Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan compared the attack with the toppling of the World Trade Center and the attack on the Pentagon in 2001, declaring, “This is Israel’s 9/11.”
As a scholar of military history, I believe the comparison is interesting and revealing. In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks by al-Qaida on the United States, President George W. Bush made a similar expansive pledge, declaring, “Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.”
The U.S. response to 9/11 included the American invasion of Afghanistan in league with the Afghan United Front, the so-called Northern Alliance. The immediate goals were to force the Taliban from power and destroy al-Qaida. Very little thought or resources were put into what happened after those goals were attained. In his 2010 memoir, “Decision Points,” former President Bush recalled a meeting of the war cabinet in late September 2001, when he asked the assemblage, “‘So who’s going to run the country (Afghanistan)?’ There was silence.”
Wars that are based on revenge can be effective in punishing an enemy, but they can also create a power vacuum that sparks a long, deadly conflict that fails to deliver sustainable stability. That’s what happened in Afghanistan, and that is what could happen in Gaza.
A war of weak results
The U.S. invasion toppled the Taliban from power by the end of 2001, but the war did not end. An interim administration headed by Hamid Karzai took power as an Afghan council of leaders, called a loya jirga, fashioned a new constitution for the country.
Nongovernmental and international relief organizations began to deliver humanitarian aid and reconstruction support, but their efforts were uncoordinated. U.S. trainers began creating a new Afghan National Army, but lack of funding, insufficient volunteers and inadequate facilities hampered the effort.
The period between 2002 and 2006 was the best opportunity to create a resilient Afghan state with enough security forces to hold its own against a resurgent Taliban. Because of a lack of focus, inadequate resources and poor strategy, however, the United States and its allies squandered that opportunity.
As a result, the Taliban was able to reconstitute its forces and return to the fight. As the insurgency gained momentum, the United States and its NATO allies increased their troop levels, but they could not overcome the weakness of the Kabul government and the lack of adequate numbers of trained Afghan security forces.
Despite a surge of forces to Afghanistan during the first two years of the Obama administration and the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban remained undefeated. As Western forces largely departed the country by the end of 2014, Afghan forces took the lead in security operations, but their numbers and competence proved insufficient to stem the Taliban tide.
Negotiations between the United States and the Taliban went nowhere, as Taliban leaders realized they could seize by force what they could not gain at the bargaining table. The Taliban entry into Kabul in August 2021 merely put an exclamation point on a campaign the United States had lost many years before.
The U.S. exit from Afghanistan in July and August 2021 was chaotic and dangerous, and it left the Afghan state at the mercy of the Taliban.
A goal that’s hard to achieve
As Israel pursues its response to the Hamas attack, the Israeli government would be well advised to remember the past two decades of often indecisive warfare conducted by both the United States and Israel against insurgent and terrorist groups.
The invasion of Afghanistan ultimately failed because U.S. policymakers did not think through the end state of the campaign as they exacted revenge for the 9/11 attacks. An Israeli invasion of Gaza could well lead to an indecisive quagmire if the political goal is not considered ahead of time.
Israel has invaded Gaza twice, in 2009 and 2014, but quickly withdrew its ground forces once Israeli leaders calculated they had reestablished deterrence. This strategy – called by Israeli leaders “mowing the grass,” with periodic punitive strikes against Hamas – has proven to be a failure. The newly declared goal of destroying Hamas as a military force is far more difficult than that.
As four U.S. presidential administrations discovered in Afghanistan, creating stability in the aftermath of conflict is far more difficult than toppling a weak regime in the first place.
The only successful conflict against a terrorist group in the past two decades, against the Islamic State group between 2014 and 2017, ended with both Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq reduced to rubble and thousands of men, women and children consigned to detention camps.
Israel has the capacity to level Gaza and round up segments of the population, but that may not be wise. Doing so might serve the immediate impulse of exacting revenge on its enemies, but Israel would likely receive massive international condemnation from creating a desert in Gaza and calling it peace, and thus forgo the moral high ground it claims in the wake of the Hamas attacks.",A reflexive act of military revenge burdened the US − and may do the same for Israel,politics
"Vladimir Putin is expected to travel outside the borders of the former Soviet Union for the first time in 20 months to meet China’s Xi Jinping on October 17. The visit, if it happens, is likely to entrench a relationship in which Russia has become a useful tool in a broader Chinese strategy to consolidate its influence in Europe and the Americas.
The occasion of Putin’s likely trip to Beijing is the tenth anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an ambitious Chinese project to expand global trade routes with other nations and extend transport and infrastructure links.
To mark this event, China’s president, Xi Jinping, will host representatives from some 130 countries in Beijing on October 17 and 18.
Putin is likely to be the star guest. According to Russian sources in September, Putin accepted Xi’s invitation, although Beijing has refused to confirm this.
The two presidents would undoubtedly have lots to discuss. Since they announced their no-limits partnership in February 2022, just before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the world has dramatically changed and keeps changing.
Instability has gripped the South Caucasus and the Middle East – both areas where Russia and China have interests at stake.
Yet their no-limits partnership has become a much more one-sided affair. Where Moscow and Beijing may once have coordinated their approaches, it is now likely that Russia aligns its policies to suit Chinese interests. The Ukraine war has weakened Russia and diminished its influence, at least for now, not only in the Middle East and the South Caucasus but also in central Asia. This has allowed China to become the dominant power there and cement its ties with the region.

Though now clearly a junior partner to Xi, Putin’s expected trip to Beijing still signals that Russia and China share a common agenda when it comes to ending a western-dominated international order and curtailing US and European influence in what both view as their zones of privileged interest across Eurasia.
Russia keeps emphasising alignment with China, not least because it has few other options except international pariah states such as North Korea and Iran.
Western sanctions against Russia in response to Moscow’s war against Ukraine have severely reduced trade along the New Eurasian Land Bridge (an overland rail link between China and Europe), once a major transport corridor for Chinese exports to European markets.
Instead, transport routes avoiding Russia have gained in importance, including the Middle Corridor linking China across central Asia, the Caspian Sea and the South Caucasus to the EU. This has also dented Russian hopes of closer integration between the BRI and Moscow’s post-Soviet economic integration initiative, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).
While the fact that Putin received an invitation from Xi to come to Beijing is important, it is also noteworthy that this is not a purely bilateral affair. In contrast to Xi’s visit to Moscow in March 2023, Putin’s trip will at best offer the Russian president an opportunity for talks with Xi in the margins of a summit designed to celebrate the BRI, a project closely associated with Xi personally.

Also, China has, and pursues, other options in its foreign relations. There is still a possibility of a meeting between US president Joe Biden and Xi at the Apec summit in San Francisco in November. And the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, visited China, possibly to prepare of an EU-China summit later this year.
What Xi wants to achieve
None of this implies that Xi is about to drop Putin as an ally. The key question is how Xi will balance his support for Putin with his need to stabilise relations with the US and prevent large-scale European “de-risking” – limiting technology exports to China, scrutinising investment from China, and decreasing dependency on China-only supply chains – that would further limit the access to EU markets for Chinese goods, services and capital.

Given the increasingly apparent conflict fatigue among Ukraine’s western partners and the likely benefits that Putin will reap from the current violent escalation in the Middle East, Xi is unlikely to disown Putin.
He may, however, see an opportunity to facilitate a settlement more on Russia’s terms than on Ukraine’s – a face-saving way out for Putin to claim victory that restores a modicum of stability across a region that remains crucial for the long-term success of the BRI and ultimately for China’s superpower aspirations.
If Xi were to pull this off, it would also cement China’s role in a future Euro-Atlantic and Euro-Asian security order.
While this would simultaneously turn Russia into a possible permanent second-order power in China’s shadow. It might also be Putin’s best hope of avoiding the humiliation of a never-ending war. That prospect, however, remains firmly on the cards, especially if China and the west maintain their current levels of support for Russia and Ukraine, respectively, which offers just enough for either side to avoid defeat.","Xi-Putin meeting: here’s what it says about their current, and future, relationship",politics
"The focus on conflict in the Middle East has again returned to the Gaza Strip, with Israel’s defense minister ordering a “complete siege” of the Palestinian enclave.
The military operation, which involves extensive bombing of residences, follows a surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023, by Hamas militants who infiltrated Israel from Gaza and killed around 1,200 Israelis. In reprisal airstrikes, the Israel military has killed over 1,400 Gazans. And that figure could escalate in the coming days. Meanwhile, an order to cut off all food, electricity and water to Gaza will only worsen the plight of residents in what has been called the “world’s largest open-air prison.”
But how did Gaza become one of the most densely populated parts of the planet? And why is it the home to militant Palestinian action now? As a scholar of Palestinian history, I believe understanding the answers to those questions provides crucial historical context to the current violence.
A brief history of Gaza
The Gaza Strip is a narrow piece of land on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Roughly twice the size of Washington, D.C., it is wedged between Israel to its north and east and Egypt to its south.
An ancient trade and sea port, Gaza has long been part of the geographic region known as Palestine. By the early 20th century, it was mainly inhabited by Muslim and Christian Arabs who lived under Ottoman rule. When Britain took control of Palestine following World War I, intellectuals in Gaza joined the emergent Palestinian national movement.
During the 1948 war that established the state of Israel, the Israeli military bombed 29 villages in southern Palestine, leading tens of thousands of villagers to flee to the Gaza Strip, under the control of the Egyptian army that were deployed after Israel declared independence. Most of them and their descendants remain there today.
Following the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Gaza Strip came under Israeli military occupation. The occupation has resulted in “systematic human rights violations,” according to rights group Amnesty International, including forcing people off their land, destroying homes and crushing even nonviolent forms of political dissent.
Palestinians staged two major uprisings, in 1987-1991 and in 2000-2005, hoping to end the occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state.
Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist militant group centered in Gaza, was founded in 1988 to fight against the Israeli occupation. Hamas and other militant groups launched repeated attacks on Israeli targets in Gaza, leading to Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. In 2006, Palestinian legislative elections were held. Hamas beat its secular rival, Fatah, which had been widely accused of corruption. Elections haven’t been held in Gaza since 2006, but polling from March 2023 found that 45% of Gazans would back Hamas should there be a vote, ahead of Fatah at 32%.
After a brief conflict between Hamas and Fatah militants in May 2007, Hamas took complete control of the Gaza Strip. Since then, Gaza has been under the administrative control of Hamas, even though it is still considered to be under Israeli occupation by the United Nations, the U.S. State Department and other international bodies.
Who are the Palestinians of Gaza?
The more than 2 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are part of the 14 million-strong global Palestinian community. About one third of Gaza’s inhabitants trace their family’s roots to land inside the Gaza Strip. The remaining two-thirds are refugees from the 1948 war and their descendants, many of whom hail from towns and villages surrounding Gaza.

The Palestinians of Gaza trend young: nearly half the population is under 18. The enclave is also very poor, with a poverty rate that stands at 53%.
Despite this grim economic picture, education levels are quite high. Over 95% of Gazan children ages 6-12 are in school. The majority of Palestinian students in Gaza graduate from high school, and 57% of students at the prestigious Islamic University of Gaza are female.
But because of the circumstances of their surroundings, young Palestinians in Gaza find it difficult to live fulfilling lives. For graduates between the ages of 19 and 29, the unemployment rate stands at 70%. And a World Bank survey earlier this year found 71% of Gazans show signs of depression and high levels of PTSD.
There are several factors that contribute to these conditions. A major factor is the crippling, 16-year blockade that Israel and Egypt – with U.S. support – have imposed on Gaza.
Years of blockade
Shortly after the 2006 elections, the Bush administration tried to force Hamas from power and bring in a rival leader from the Fatah party who was considered friendlier to Israel and the U.S. Hamas preempted the coup and took full control of Gaza in May 2007. In response, Israel and Egypt – with U.S. and European support – closed the border crossings into and out of the Gaza Strip and imposed a land, air and sea blockade.
The blockade, which is still in effect, limits the import of food, fuel and construction material; limits how far Gaza’s fishermen can go out to sea; bans almost all exports; and imposes strict limitations on the movement of people into and out of Gaza. In 2023, Israel has allowed only around 50,000 people a month to exit Gaza, according to U.N. figures.
The years of closure have devastated the lives of Palestinians in Gaza. Inhabitants there don’t have enough water for drinking and sanitation. They face electricity cuts that run 12 to 18 hours each day. Without adequate water and electricity, Gaza’s fragile health care system is “on the brink of collapse,” according to the medical rights group Medical Aid for Palestine.
These restrictions hit the young and the weak of Gaza particularly hard. Israel routinely denies sick patients the permits they need to receive medical care outside of Gaza. Bright students with scholarships to study abroad often find that they are unable to leave.
U.N. experts say this blockade is illegal under international law. They argue that the blockade amounts to a collective punishment of the Palestinians of Gaza, a violation of the Hague Convention and the Geneva Conventions that form the backbone of international law.
No end to the suffering
Israel says that the blockade on Gaza is necessary to secure the safety of its population and will be lifted when Hamas renounces violence, recognizes Israel and abides by previous agreements.
But Hamas has consistently rejected this ultimatum. Instead, militant fighters stepped up the firing of homemade rockets and mortars into populated areas surrounding the Gaza Strip in 2008, seeking to pressure Israel to lift the blockade. They have sporadically attacked Israel in this way in the years since.

Israel has launched four major military assaults on Gaza – in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021 – in efforts to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities. Those wars killed 4,000 Palestinians, more than half of whom were civilians, along with 106 people in Israel.
During that time, the U.N. estimates that there has been more than $5 billion worth of damage to Gaza’s homes, agriculture, industry, electricity and water infrastructure.
Each of those wars ended in a fragile cease-fire but no real resolution to the conflict. Israel seeks to deter Hamas from launching rockets. Hamas and other militant groups say that even when they have upheld previous cease-fires, Israel has continued to attack Palestinians and has refused to lift the blockade.
Hamas has offered a long-term truce in exchange for Israel ending the blockade on Gaza. Israel has refused to accept the offer, sticking to its position that Hamas must first end violence and recognize Israel.
In the months leading up to the latest escalation, conditions in Gaza have deteriorated even further. The International Monetary Fund reported in September that Gaza’s economic outlook “remains dire.” Conditions became more dire when Israel announced on Sept. 5, 2023, that it was halting all exports from a key Gaza border crossing.
Without an end in sight to the suffering caused by the blockade, it appears that Hamas has decided to upend the status quo in a surprise attack on Israelis, including civilians. Israel’s reprisal airstrikes and its imposition of a “complete siege” on the strip have heaped even further suffering on ordinary Gazans.
It is a tragic reminder that civilians bear the brunt of this conflict.

"Starmer’s challenge in his speech to the Labour party conference was to present himself as a prime minister in waiting. To achieve this, he had to embody both authority and authenticity, credibility as a leader but also sympathy with the experiences of ordinary Britons.
He also had to present his own origins, as well as a direction of travel. He effectively needed to turn his story into strategy. As one journalist wrote about Jeremy Corbyn: “Authenticity is great, but so is strategy.”
Stories provide insight into leadership and substantiate claims of authenticity, a quality that “has become a key battleground in contemporary politics”. Donald Trump was portrayed as the “authenticity candidate” ahead of the 2016, for example.
With more attention than ever on his speech, this was an unparalleled chance to deploy a resource hitherto ignored by Starmer and weaponised by his opponents: his personal life. A leader’s life story is an important tool for influencing potential followers.
As Robert Shrimsley, chief political commentator at the Financial Times, has argued: “If the Labour leader’s character is to be the central issue at the next election, Starmer must settle that question to his advantage before the Conservatives answer it for him.”
Starmer made some progress on this matter, incorporating references to his own life. He spoke of holidays to the Lake District with his wife, and of going there every year with his parents. He referenced his childhood in Surrey when discussing the green belt, and snobbery towards his father’s vocational skills on the topic of working-class university aspirations.
‘I grew up working class’
The Conservatives have capitalised on Starmer’s knighthood and turned what should be credentials into a weakness. They repeat the word “Sir” over and over when referring to Starmer in order to imply that he is upper class rather than working class – his actual background.
Starmer addressed this head-on – finally – at the conference. Alongside references to his sister, who is a careworker, he stated clearly that he “grew up working class” and had been fighting all his life: “I’ve felt the anxiety of a cost of living crisis before. And until your family can see the way out, I will fight for you.”
Starmer referenced his wife several times during the speech. Alamy
The Tory line of attack is partially explained by the fact that Starmer embodies many virtues that Tories traditionally lay claim to. A knighthood reflects public service and dedication. In some cases, including Starmer’s, it shows someone has worked their way up from humble beginnings.
Crucially, Starmer was knighted for “services to law and criminal justice” – territory that Conservatives would traditionally claim as their own. This explains attempts to turn Starmer’s achievements against him.
His tactic of emphasising the need for Labour to be a “party of service” and of painting the Conservatives as unable to understand the lives and challenges of the working people is his response. “Why Labour?” he asked the conference. “Because we serve your interests.”
A chance to seize the narrative
As Labour leader, Starmer has been private and distant. His deputy, Angela Rayner, has remarked that his greatest weakness is that he “undershares”. This is a problem for a political leader in an age of personalised politics, as is reflected in numerous criticisms levelled at Starmer, such as that he lacks personal charisma.
Starmer has a great deal of authenticity to draw upon. As the son of an NHS nurse with Still’s disease, he spent much of his childhood experiencing the NHS as the relative of a worker and a patient.
So it is surely not a coincidence that he announced that money saved from clamping down on non-domiciled tax status would pay for the regeneration of the NHS. That, after all, was the tax arrangement enjoyed by Sunak’s wife for so long. This was Starmer turning the personal-narrative-as-strategy back on his opponent.
Today was Starmer’s big chance to reinforce his working-class credentials, and more broadly his claims of authenticity. This was perhaps the last big chance before an election next year.
It was also chance to capture attention and discussion on his own terms (even if a glitter-wielding protester had other plans). In the end, we saw Starmer realise the value of turning a personal story into strategy. He strengthened his vision of the future by looking inwards at his personal life, and backwards at his origins.",Keir Starmer’s chance to sparkle: Labour leader finally puts his working class credentials to work for him,politics
"There will be only one winner in the war that has broken out between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. And it is neither Israel nor Hamas.
In an operation coined “the Al-Aqsa Storm,” Hamas, whose formal name is the Islamic Resistance Movement, fired thousands of rockets into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters infiltrated Israel by land, sea and air. Hundreds of Israelis have been killed, more than 2,000 injured, and many taken hostage.
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on Hamas and launched airstrikes in Gaza. In the first day of reprisals, close to 400 Palestinians were killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
In the weeks ahead, the Israeli military will surely retaliate and kill hundreds more Palestinian militants and civilians. As an analyst of Middle East politics and security, I believe that thousands on both sides will suffer. But when the smoke settles, only one country’s interests will have been served: Iran’s.
Already, some analysts are suggesting that Tehran’s fingerprints can be seen on the surprise attack on Israel. At the very least, Iran’s leaders have reacted to the assault with encouragement and support.

The decisive factor shaping Iran’s foreign policy was the 1979 overthrow of the U.S.-friendly, repressive Shah of Iran and the transfer of state power into the hands of a Shiite Muslim revolutionary regime. That regime was defined by stark anti-American imperialism and anti-Israeli Zionism.
The revolution, its leaders claimed, was not just against the corrupt Iranian monarchy; it was intended to confront oppression and injustice everywhere, and especially those governments backed by the United States – chief among them, Israel.
For Iran’s leaders, Israel and the United States represented immorality, injustice and the greatest threat to Muslim society and Iranian security. The enduring hostility felt toward Israel is in no small part due to its close ties with the shah and Israel’s role in his sustained oppression of the Iranian people. Together with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, helped organize the shah’s secret police and intelligence service, the SAVAK. This organization relied on increasingly harsh tactics to put down dissenters during the shah’s last two decades in power, including mass imprisonment, torture, disappearances, forced exile and killing thousands of Iranians.
Support for Palestinian liberation was a central theme of Iran’s revolutionary message. The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon – in retaliation for Lebanon-based Palestinian attacks against Israel – provided Iran an opportunity to live up to its anti-Zionist rhetoric by challenging Israeli soldiers in Lebanon and checking U.S. influence in the region.
Subsidizing conflict
To that end, Iran sent its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – a branch of Iran’s military, usually known as the “Revolutionary Guard” – to Lebanon to organize and support Lebanese and Palestinian militants. In Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, Revolutionary Guardsmen instructed Shiite resistance fighters in religion, revolutionary ideology and guerrilla tactics, and provided weapons, funds, training and encouragement. Iran’s leadership transformed these early trainees from a ragtag band of fighters into Lebanon’s most powerful political and military force today, and Iran’s greatest foreign policy success, Hezbollah.
Since the early 1980s, Iran has maintained support for anti-Israeli militant groups and operations. The Islamic Republic has publicly pledged millions of dollars of annual support to groups and provides advanced military training for thousands of Palestinian fighters at Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah bases in Iran and Lebanon.
Iran runs a sophisticated smuggling network to funnel weapons into Gaza, which has long been cut off from the outside world by an Israeli blockade.
Via the Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah, Iran has encouraged and enabled Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas violence, and these Palestinian fighters now represent a crucial element in what foreign affairs analysts call Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” against Israel and the United States, which constitutes Iran’s chief purpose.
But Iran cannot risk confronting either state directly.
Iranian weapons, funds and training enable surges in Palestinian militant violence against Israel when frustrations boil over, including during the Palestinian uprisings known as the first and second intifadas.
Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and death tolls have escalated steadily since 2020. Palestinians are outraged by increased evictions and destruction of property, and how Israel allows Israeli nationalists and settlers to violate a long-standing agreement preventing Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque – a site holy to both Muslims and Jews. In fact, a recent incursion by settlers into Al-Aqsa was specifically cited by Hamas as a justification for the Oct. 7 attack.

Attacking normalization
That is not to say that Iran ordered Hamas’ attack on Israel, nor that Iran controls Palestinian militants – they are not Iranian puppets. Nevertheless, Iran’s leaders welcomed the attacks, the timing of which serendipitously works in Iran’s favor and plays into the Islamic republic’s regional battle for influence.
“What took place today is in line with the continuation of victories for the anti-Zionist resistance in different fields, including Syria, Lebanon and occupied lands,” according to Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani.
The week before the Hamas attack, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman denied reports that Saudi Arabia had paused its recent efforts to normalize relations with Israel, which includes a formal declaration of Israel’s right to exist and increased diplomatic engagement. “Every day we get closer,” he said, an assessment praised and echoed by Netanyahu.
Israeli-Saudi normalization would represent the pinnacle of achievement thus far in U.S. diplomatic efforts, including the Abraham Accords, signed by Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco in 2020. The accords aimed to normalize and build peaceful relations between Israel and Arab countries across the Middle East and in Africa.
Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei lambasted Arab states for signing the Abraham Accords, accusing them of “treason against the global Islamic community.”
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah praised Saturday’s violence against Israel and echoed Khamenei’s sentiments, warning that the attacks sent a message, “especially to those seeking normalization with this enemy.”
Israel’s expected heavy-handed response is likely to complicate Saudi Arabia’s normalization with Israel in the near term, furthering Iran’s aims. Netanyahu said that Israel’s retaliatory operation seeks three objectives: to eliminate the threat of infiltrators and restore peace to attacked Israeli communities, to simultaneously “exact an immense price from the enemy” in Gaza, and to reinforce “other fronts so that nobody should mistakenly join this war.” This last objective is a subtle but clear warning to Hezbollah and Iran to stay out of the fight.
Israeli troops have already mobilized to secure its borders, and airstrikes have hit Gaza. In all likelihood, Palestinian attackers will be killed or arrested in a matter of days. Israeli troops and air forces will target known or suspected rocket launch, manufacturing, storage and transportation sites, along with the homes of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members. But in the process, hundreds of civilians will likely also lose their lives.
I believe that Iran expects and welcomes all of this.
How Iran wins
There are at least three possible outcomes to the war, and they all play in Iran’s favor.
First, Israel’s heavy-handed response may turn off Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to U.S.-backed Israeli normalization efforts. Second, if Israel deems it necessary to push further into Gaza to eradicate the threat, this could provoke another Palestinian uprising in East Jerusalem or the West Bank, leading to a more widespread Israeli response and greater instability.
Lastly, Israel could achieve its first two objectives with the minimal amount of force necessary, foregoing usual heavy-handed tactics and reducing chances of escalation. But this is unlikely. And even if this occurred, the underlying causes that led to this latest outbreak of violence, and the enabling role Iran plays in that process, have not been addressed.
And when the next round of Israeli-Palestinian violence occurs – and it will – I believe Iran’s leaders will again congratulate themselves for a job well done.","The Israel-Hamas war: No matter who loses, Iran wins",politics
"Almost 50 years ago to the day, Israel had failed to anticipate the outbreak of the 1973 Yom Kippur war – a shock attack on its borders by a coalition of Arab states.
Now, it appears the country’s intelligence apparatuses have fallen victim to a false sense of security once again.
The belief, widely shared across Israeli society, that the Hamas militant group would avoid a large-scale military confrontation with Israel to protect itself and spare further suffering and harm to the residents of Gaza was shattered by a surprise assault on Saturday morning by air, land and sea.
The attack began with a barrage of more than 2,000 rockets fired into Israel. Under the cover of the rockets, a large-scale, carefully coordinated, ground operation set out from Gaza and attacked more than 20 Israeli towns and army bases adjacent to the strip.

Israeli losses, estimated presently at more than 250 dead and as many as 1,500 wounded, are certain to increase in the coming hours and days.
Israel’s military reserves have commenced a massive mobilisation as aerial bombings of Hamas installations and command posts in Gaza are being carried out. More than 230 Palestinian casualties have been reported so far in Gaza, with 1,700 wounded.
Calculations behind the attack
As in the case of the Yom Kippur war, numerous analyses and investigations will be undertaken in the coming weeks, months and years on the intelligence, operational and political failures that allowed the Hamas attack to unfold. The assault was apparently initially undetected by Israel, and then for hours met with either insufficient or unprepared Israeli forces.
Similar to the 1973 war, the purposefully chosen timing of a Sabbath and the Jewish holiday of Sukkot provide initial, though very partial, clues to the breakdown.
Hamas’ strategic calculations in launching the attack are uncertain at this stage. However, the assured severity of Israel’s retaliation against the group – and as a consequence, the civilian population in Gaza – makes it likely that considerations beyond just tit-for-tat revenge were at play.

Kidnapping Israelis for prisoner swaps with Hamas militants jailed in Israel, for instance, has been among the most highly desired objectives of the group’s military operations in the past.
In 2011, a single Israel soldier, Gilad Shalit, who had been held captive in Gaza since 2006, was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Among these prisoners was Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ current leader in Gaza, who had served 22 years in an Israeli jail.
The reports of dozens of Israelis being taken captive in this weekend’s assault – many of them civilians – suggest this may have been a central motive behind the attack. An unknown number of hostages held for hours by Hamas militants in two Israeli southern towns were later freed by Israeli special forces.

Another broader objective for Hamas may have been to undermine the ongoing negotiations between the US and Saudi Arabia on an agreement to normalise relations between the kingdom and Israel.
Thwarting these talks would be a significant boon for Iran, a key backer of Hamas, and its allies. While Tehran has said it supports the attacks by Hamas against Israel, it remains uncertain at this point whether Iran or Hezbollah (the militant group in Lebanon that has a growing partnership with Hamas) would open additional fronts against Israel in the coming days.
Any escalation in the conflict from either Iran or Lebanon would be highly problematic for Israel. The same would apply if the war with Hamas further exacerbates the already high tensions and violent clashes between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank.

What could happen next?
Named “Iron Swords,” Israel’s retaliatory offensive against Hamas in Gaza is likely to last a long time. The challenges it faces are massive.
Along with the need to restore the trust of the Israeli public and resurrect Israel’s smashed military deterrence against Hamas and other foes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government will likely have to deal with other complexities:
the fate of potentially dozens of Israeli hostages
the significantly elevated risks for Israel’s forces should a ground incursion be carried out
and the threats of escalation on other fronts, including Lebanon, the West Bank, and mixed Jewish-Palestinian cities inside Israel.
International support for an aggressive operation could also become difficult to retain amid a mounting toll of civilian Palestinian casualties.
The current round of violence has barely started, but it could end up being the bloodiest in decades – perhaps since the war between Israel and the Palestinians in Lebanon during the 1980s.

As noted, Israelis will consider it critically important to reclaim their country’s military deterrence capabilities against Hamas, which in the eyes of many, may necessitate a military takeover of Gaza. This would bring more devastating outcomes for Gaza’s civilian population.
For many Palestinians, this weekend’s events offered Israelis a small taste of what their own lives have been like under decades of occupation. However, the early celebrations will likely soon turn into anger and frustration as the numbers of Palestinian civilian casualties will continue to rise. Violence begets violence.
In the short and medium terms, the trauma of Hamas’ surprise attack is bound to have momentous consequences for Israel’s domestic politics.
It’s still too early to assess the likely many long-term impacts of the attack on Israelis and their sense of security. But one thing is clear: the already challenging prospects for the building of trust between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples have just suffered a devastating blow.

In his 2022 memoir, Bibi: My Story, Netanyahu wrote about his decision during Israel’s “Pillar of Defense” operation against Hamas in 2012 to avoid an Israeli ground assault in Gaza.
Such an attack, he warned, could lead to many hundreds of Israeli Defence Force casualties and many thousands of Palestinian casualties – something he was adamantly against. He did authorise ground incursions on two other occasions (operations “Cast Lead” in 2008 and “Protective Edge” in 2014). But his cautious tendencies prevailed in other cases, at times, in the face of strong pressure.
Arguably, this weekend’s national trauma and the radical make-up of Netanyahu’s right-wing government will make it very difficult for him to show similar restraint in the coming days.","After a shocking Hamas assault on Israel, both sides brace for the devastating fallout",politics
"The parallels were striking – and surely not coincidental.
Exactly 50 years and a day after being taken completely off guard by a coordinated military attack by its neighbors – Egypt and Syria – Israel was again caught by surprise.
Early on Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants invaded southern Israel by land, sea and air, and fired thousands of rockets deep into the country. Within hours, hundreds of Israelis were killed, hostages taken and war declared. Fierce Israeli reprisals have already taken the lives of hundreds of Palestinians in Gaza, and many more will surely be dead by the time this war is over.
Because war it is. After the Hamas attacks began and the Israeli death toll grew, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the country is at war, just as it was 50 years ago.
And that is not where the parallels end.
Both wars began with surprise attacks on Jewish holy days. In 1973, it was Yom Kippur, a day of atonement for Jews. This time it was Simchat Torah, when Jews celebrate reading the Torah.
Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in control of the densely populated Gaza Strip that adjoins Israel, seemingly hopes to send the same message that Egypt and Syria delivered in October 1973: They will not accept the status quo, and Israel’s military might will not keep Israelis safe.
The 1973 war proved to be a watershed moment not only in the Arab-Israeli conflict but also for the politics of Israel. Will this war be the same?
Caught flat-footed both times
Certainly, the sudden outbreak of war has again left Israelis deeply shocked, just as it did 50 years ago. This war, like the one in 1973, is already being framed as a colossal intelligence failure.
Although Israeli military intelligence had warned the government that the country’s enemies believed Israel vulnerable, the intelligence establishment did not expect Hamas to attack.
Rather, the intelligence assessment was that Hamas was most interested in governing the Gaza Strip and didn’t want to have a war with Israel, at least not for a while.
The assumption was that Hamas would be deterred from carrying out major attacks in Israel out of fear of Israel’s potential disproportionate retaliation bringing more devastation to Gaza. The enclave, home to 2 million Palestinians, many living in poverty, has still not recovered from the last major round of fighting in May 2021.
Instead, the intelligence establishment, and many analysts, believed that Hamas preferred to export Palestinian violence to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where it could help to undermine the already weak and unpopular Palestinian Authority, led by Hamas’ political rival.
Their intelligence assessment has proved to be terribly wrong, just as it was prior to the outbreak of the 1973 war. Then, as now, Israel’s adversaries were not deterred by its military superiority.
Israeli intelligence not only misjudged the willingness of adversaries to go to war, but it also failed – both in 1973 and now – to recognize their enemy’s preparations.
This time, that failure is even more glaring given Israel’s extensive and sophisticated intelligence gathering capabilities. Hamas must have been carefully planning this attack for many months, right under Israel’s nose.
This is undoubtedly Israel’s worst intelligence failure since the 1973 war.
But it is not only an intelligence failure, it is also a military failure. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, was clearly not prepared for an attack of this magnitude – indeed, most IDF units were deployed in the West Bank.

It is true that IDF’s top brass had repeatedly warned Netanyahu that its military readiness had been diminished by the wave of Israeli reservists refusing to serve in protest of the government’s attempted judicial overhaul. Nonetheless, the IDF was confident that its defensive fortifications – especially the expensive hi-tech barrier that had been built around the Gaza Strip – would prevent Hamas militants from entering Israel, as they had previously done in a May 2021 raid.
But just as the so-called Bar-Lev defensive line along the Suez Canal failed to stop Egyptian soldiers from crossing the canal in 1973, the Gaza barrier did not stop Hamas militants. It was simply circumvented and bulldozed through.
The blame game begins
There will surely be the same blame game after this war as there was after the 1973 war. A commission of inquiry will probably be established, as happened after the 1973 war – the Agranat Commission – which published a scathing report, pointing the finger of blame firmly in the direction of Israel’s military and intelligence establishment.
But it is not Israel’s military and intelligence establishment that deserves most of the blame for this war. It is Israel’s political establishment – above all, Netanyahu, who has led the country since 2009, save for a one-year exception between 2021-2022.
The 1973 war was also due to a political failure, not only an intelligence failure. In fact, it was Israel’s political leadership, chiefly Prime Minister Golda Meir and her defense minister Moshe Dayan, that was primarily to blame because in the years before the war they had spurned diplomatic overtures from Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. The Israeli government was determined to retain parts of the Sinai peninsula – which Israel had captured in the 1967 war – even at the price of peace with Egypt.
Similarly, Netanyahu has ignored recent Egyptian efforts to broker a long-term truce between Israel, Hamas and fellow militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. And Israel’s current far-right government prefers to retain the occupied West Bank rather than pursue the possibility of peace with the Palestinians.
Moreover, the Netanyahu government has been preoccupied with its widely unpopular attempt to reduce the power and independence of Israel’s Supreme Court, a move seemingly aimed at removing a potential obstacle to a formal annexation of the West Bank. The domestic turmoil and deep divisions that the proposed judicial overhaul have created in Israel is almost certainly one reason why Hamas decided to attack now.
More broadly, with the latest attack it is clear that Netanyahu’s strategy to contain and deter Hamas has failed catastrophically. It has been catastrophic for Israelis, especially those living in the south of the country, and even more so for Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
Maintaining a blockade of Gaza for 16 years, crippling its economy and effectively imprisoning its 2 million residents, has not brought Hamas to its knees.
Rather, Hamas’ control over Gaza, sustained by repression, has only tightened. Innocent civilians on both sides of the border have paid a high price for this failure.
In the wake of the 1973 war, Meir was forced to resign, and a few years later, the ruling Labor Party – which had been in power, in various guises, since the country’s founding in 1948 – was defeated by Menachem Begin’s right-wing Likud Party in the 1977 general election. This was a watershed moment in Israeli domestic politics that was brought about in large part by the public’s loss of confidence in the then-dominant Labor Party as a result of the 1973 war.
Will history repeat itself this time around? Will this war finally spell the end for Netanyahu and Likud’s long dominance of Israeli politics? Most Israelis have already turned against Netanyahu, repelled by the mix of corruption scandals that surround him, his attempts to downgrade the power of the judiciary and the lurch to the right that his ruling coalition represents.
More Israelis may now do so because this devastating surprise attack surely contradicts any claim by Netanyahu of being Israel’s “Mr. Security.”
Whatever the outcome of this new war and its political repercussions in Israel, it is already clear that its outbreak will be long remembered by Israelis with great sadness and anger, just like the 1973 war still is.
Indeed, it will probably be even more traumatic for Israelis than that war was because while in 1973 it was members of the military bearing the brunt of the surprise assault, this time it is Israeli civilians who have been captured and killed, and on sovereign Israeli territory. In this crucial respect, then, this war is unlike the one in 1973.","Hamas assault echoes 1973 Arab-Israeli war – a shock attack and questions of political, intelligence culpability",politics
"The Great Sand Sea Desert stretches over an area of 72,000km² linking Egypt and Libya. If you find yourself in a particular part of the desert in south-east Libya and south-western parts of Egypt, you’ll spot pieces of yellow glass scattered across the sandy landscape.
It was first described in a scientific paper in 1933 and is known as Libyan desert glass. Mineral collectors value it for its beauty, its relative rarity – and its mystery. A pendant found in Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun’s tomb contains a piece of the glass. Natural glasses are found elsewhere in the world; examples include moldavites from the Ries crater in Europe and tektites from the Ivory Coast. But none are as rich in silica as Libyan desert glass, nor are they found in such large lumps and quantities.
The origin of the glass has been the subject of debate among scientists for almost a century. Some suggested it might be from volcanoes on the moon. Others propose it’s the product of lightning strikes (“fulgurites” – glass that forms from fusion of sand and soil where they are hit by lightning). Other theories suggest it’s the result of sedimentary or hydrothermal processes; caused by a massive explosion of a meteor in the air; or that it came from a nearby meteorite crater.
Now, thanks to advanced microscopy technology, we believe we have the answer. Along with colleagues from universities and science centres in Germany, Egypt and Morocco, I have identified Libyan desert glass as originating from the impact of a meteorite on the Earth’s surface.
Space collisions are a primary process in the solar system, as planets and their natural satellites accreted via the asteroids and planet embryos (also called planetesimals) colliding with each other. These impacts helped our planet to assemble, too.
Under the microscope
In 1996 scientists determined that the glass was close to 29 million years old. A later study suggested the source material was composed of quartz grains, coated with mixed clay minerals and iron and titanium oxides.
This latter finding raised more questions, since the proposed age is older than the matching source material in the relevant area of the Great Sand Sea desert. To put it simply: those source materials didn’t exist in that location 29 million years ago.
For our recent study, a co-author obtained two pieces of the glass from a local who had collected them in the Al Jaouf region in south-eastern Libya.
We studied the samples with a state-of-the-art transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique, which allows us to see tiny particles of material – 20,000 times smaller than the thickness of a paper sheet. Using this super-high magnification technique, we found small minerals in this glass: different types of zirconium oxide (ZrO₂).

Minerals are composed of chemical elements, atoms of which form regular three-dimensional packaging. Imagine putting eggs or soda bottles on the shelf of a supermarket: layers on top of layers to ensure the most efficient storage. Similarly, atoms assemble into a crystal lattice that is unique for each mineral. Minerals that have the same chemical composition but different atomic structure (different ways of atom packaging into the crystal lattice) are called polymorphs.
One polymorph of ZrO₂ that we observed in Libyan desert glass is called cubic zirconia – the kind seen in some jewellery as a synthetic replacement for diamonds. This mineral can only form at a high temperature between 2,250°C and 2,700°C.
Another polymorph of ZrO₂ that we observed was a very rare one called ortho-II or OII. It forms at very high pressure – about 130,000 atmospheres, a unit of pressure.
Such pressure and temperature conditions provided us with the proof for the meteorite impact origin of the glass. That’s because such conditions can only be obtained in the Earth’s crust by a meteorite impact or the explosion of an atomic bomb.
More mysteries to solve
If our finding is correct (and we believe it is), the parental crater – where the meteorite hit the Earth’s surface – should be somewhere nearby. The nearest known meteorite craters, named GP and Oasis, are 2km and 18km in diameter respectively, and quite far away from where the glass we tested was found. They are too far and too small to be considered the parental craters for such massive amounts of impact glass, all concentrated in one spot.

So, while we’ve solved part of the mystery, more questions remain. Where is the parental crater? How big is it – and where is it? Could it have been eroded, deformed or covered by sand? More investigations will be required, likely in the form of remote sensing studies coupled with geophysics.",Libyan desert’s yellow glass: how we discovered the origin of these rare and mysterious shards,science + tech
"On Friday, OpenAI’s high-flying chief executive Sam Altman was unexpectedly fired by the company’s board. Co-founder and chief technology officer Greg Brockman was also removed as the board president, after which he promptly resigned.
In an unexpected twist, talks began today about potentially reinstating Altman in some capacity following an outpouring of industry and investor support for him and several OpenAI researchers who quit their jobs in solidarity.
Shockingly, however, that too was not to be. As of publication, Bloomberg reporters announced OpenAI’s interim CEO, Mira Murati, had not managed to rehire Altman and Brockman as she had planned.
Instead, the board found a new CEO – Emmett Shear – in record time. Shear, the former CEO of Twitch, will now take over from Murati as interim CEO, as reported by The Information.
It has been an epic backstabbing scene worthy of the HBO drama Succession. While many have speculated about why the board may have forced Altman out, details remain scarce.
What we can say is the decision to fire Altman will likely put a dent in OpenAI’s commercial progress.
An unusual company structure
OpenAI is the hottest company in tech today, having released the ChatGPT chatbot and DALL-E image generator onto a largely unsuspecting public.
The company’s mission is simple: to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) – that is, an AI which is as smart or smarter than a human – and to do so for the public good. Many were starting to believe OpenAI could succeed at this goal.
Read more: Will AI ever reach human-level intelligence? We asked five experts
But developing AGI isn’t just a technical challenge. It’s a major management and economic nightmare. How can you ensure the vast power and wealth generated by AGI doesn’t subvert the company’s goal to seek the public good?
Many individuals within OpenAI and the wider tech community worry AI is progressing too fast. A global race in AI development is underway and the commercial pressure to succeed is immense.
Following its launch, ChatGPT quickly became the fastest-growing app in history, and OpenAI is by many measures one of the world’s fastest-growing companies. Its most recent funding round (which may now be scuppered by the recent drama) was set to value the company at around US$90 billion. Silicon Valley has never seen anything like it.
Given its mission, OpenAI was originally set up as a not-for-profit. But developing AGI requires billions of dollars. To raise these billions, Altman pivoted the company towards a unique dual for-profit and not-for-profit structure.
The outcome was a for-profit subsidiary which is controlled by the not-for-profit. But the for-profit subsidiary is itself unusual, as it limits the return for investors (including Microsoft) to 100 times their stake.
Calls to bring back Altman
On top of OpenAI’s odd dual structure sat a board made up of Altman, Brockman, chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and three outsiders.
Many saw Altman as central to OpenAI’s success. The candid and boyish tech entrepreneur was previously president of Y Combinator, a legendary Silicon Valley startup accelerator that has launched many household names including Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit, Stripe and Doordash.
Altman, a Stanford dropout, is a geek with immense social and strategic intelligence. He is also, by all accounts, a genius at building companies and someone who can effortlessly play three-dimensional chess in the cut and thrust of the business world.
In fact, Altman was already a billionaire when Elon Musk brought him on as one of the OpenAI founders in 2015. Musk would later go through his own drama, which led to him leaving the board, and to Altman going back on his original plan of having an open not-for-profit initiative to develop AGI.
OpenAI’s former CTO Brockman was a master at coding, and phenomenally hard working. He is what people in the Valley call a “10x engineer” – someone who has as much productivity as 10 normal coders.
That leaves Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist. He was one of the inventors of AlexNet, a powerful neural network which started the AI deep learning revolution about a decade ago – and also of the GPT language models that started the generative AI revolution. To be responsible for two of the technical innovations that have fuelled the AI frenzy is without precedent.
Sutskever, in particular, seems to be a major key player in the latest drama. According to inside reports, he was worried OpenAI was moving too fast and that Altman was putting money ahead of safety and the company’s original mission. It was Sutskever who persuaded the three outside board members to fire Altman, reports claim.
The shock news of the sacking prompted multiple key staff to either quit or threaten to quit, while investors including Microsoft applied pressure for his return. But it seems this wasn’t enough to bring Altman back.
Microsoft, the largest investor in OpenAI, had promised about US$10 billion towards OpenAI’s goals. But without a seat on OpenAI’s board, Microsoft was only informed of Altman’s departure moments before the news broke.
The word on the street now is Altman and his followers will likely be branching out with their own AI venture.
What’s next?
The OpenAI board justified its original decision to fire Altman on the basis he was “not consistently candid” with them, without further clarification. Some think this may mean the board, which operates as a not-for-profit board, may have felt that under Altman they weren’t able to carry out the board’s duty of ensuring OpenAI was building AGI for the good of humanity.
In the months leading up to his dismissal, Altman had pitched several ideas for new AI projects to investors, including a plan to develop custom chips to train extremely large AI models, which would let it compete with chip company Nvidia.
The board’s decision will likely have a lasting impact. Sutskever’s position in the company is now likely greatly weakened (I wouldn’t be surprised if he leaves or is pushed out). At the same time, his actions may well have addressed his concerns about OpenAI moving too fast.
As OpenAI emerges from this drama, it will be doubled over from the blow that was this weekend – and will struggle to raise funds in the future as it has in the past.","Who is Sam Altman, OpenAI’s wunderkind ex-CEO – and why was he fired?",science + tech
"Prehistoric men hunted; prehistoric women gathered. At least this is the standard narrative written by and about men to the exclusion of women.
The idea of “Man the Hunter” runs deep within anthropology, convincing people that hunting made us human, only men did the hunting, and therefore evolutionary forces must only have acted upon men. Such depictions are found not only in media, but in museums and introductory anthropology textbooks, too.
A common argument is that a sexual division of labor and unequal division of power exists today; therefore, it must have existed in our evolutionary past as well. But this is a just-so story without sufficient evidentiary support, despite its pervasiveness in disciplines like evolutionary psychology.
There is a growing body of physiological, anatomical, ethnographic and archaeological evidence to suggest that not only did women hunt in our evolutionary past, but they may well have been better suited for such an endurance-dependent activity.
We are both biological anthropologists. Cara specializes in the physiology of humans living in extreme conditions, using her research to reconstruct how our ancestors may have adapted to different climates. Sarah studies Neanderthal and early modern human health, and excavates at their archaeological sites.
It’s not uncommon for scientists like us – who attempt to include the contributions of all individuals, regardless of sex and gender, in reconstructions of our evolutionary past – to be accused of rewriting the past to fulfill a politically correct, woke agenda. The actual evidence speaks for itself, though: Gendered labor roles did not exist in the Paleolithic era, which lasted from 3.3 million years ago until 12,000 years ago. The story is written in human bodies, now and in the past.
We recognize that biological sex can be defined using multiple characteristics, including chromosomes, genitalia and hormones, each of which exists on a spectrum. Social gender, too, is not a binary category. We use the terms female and male when discussing the physiological and anatomical evidence, as this is what the research literature tends to use.
Female bodies: Adapted for endurance
One of the key arguments put forth by “Man the Hunter” proponents is that females would not have been physically capable of taking part in the long, arduous hunts of our evolutionary past. But a number of female-associated features, which provide an endurance advantage, tell a different story.
All human bodies, regardless of sex, have and need both the hormones estrogen and testosterone. On average, females have more estrogen and males more testosterone, though there is a great deal of variation and overlap.
Testosterone often gets all the credit when it comes to athletic success. But estrogen – technically the estrogen receptor – is deeply ancient, originating somewhere between 1.2 billion and 600 million years ago. It predates the existence of sexual reproduction involving egg and sperm. The testosterone receptor originated as a duplicate of the estrogen receptor and is only about half as old. As such, estrogen, in its many forms and pervasive functions, seems necessary for life among both females and males.
Estrogen influences athletic performance, particularly endurance performance. The greater concentrations of estrogen that females tend to have in their bodies likely confer an endurance advantage – an ability to exercise for a longer period of time without becoming exhausted.
The hormone estrogen has multiple effects throughout the body and plays a role in people regardless of sex. Cara Ocobock, CC BY-ND
Estrogen signals the body to burn more fat – beneficial during endurance activity for two key reasons. First, fat has more than twice the calories per gram as carbohydrates do. And it takes longer to metabolize fats than carbs. So, fat provides more bang for the buck overall, and the slow burn provides sustained energy over longer periods of time, which can delay fatigue during endurance activities like running.
In addition to their estrogen advantage, females have a greater proportion of type I muscle fibers relative to males.
These are slow oxidative muscle fibers that prefer to metabolize fats. They’re not particularly powerful, but they take awhile to fatigue – unlike the powerful type II fibers that males have more of but that tire rapidly. Doing the same intense exercise, females burn 70% more fats than males do, and unsurprisingly, are less likely to fatigue.
Estrogen also appears to be important for post-exercise recovery. Intense exercise or heat exposure can be stressful for the body, eliciting an inflammatory response via the release of heat shock proteins. Estrogen limits this response, which would otherwise inhibit recovery. Estrogen also stabilizes cell membranes that might otherwise be damaged or rupture due to the stress of exercise. Thanks to this hormone, females incur less damage during exercise and are therefore capable of faster recovery.
A variety of physiological differences add up to an advantage for women in endurance activities. Cara Ocobock, CC BY-ND
Women in the past likely did everything men did
Forget the Flintstones’ nuclear family with a stay-at-home wife. There’s no evidence of this social structure or gendered labor roles during the 2 million years of evolution for the genus Homo until the last 12,000 years, with the advent of agriculture.
Our Neanderthal cousins, a group of humans who lived across Western and Central Eurasia approximately 250,000 to 40,000 years ago, formed small, highly-nomadic bands. Fossil evidence shows females and males experienced the same bony traumas across their bodies – a signature of a hard life hunting deer, aurochs and wooly mammoths. Tooth wear that results from using the front teeth as a third hand, likely in tasks like tanning hides, is equally evident across females and males.
This nongendered picture should not be surprising when you imagine small-group living. Everyone needs to contribute to the tasks necessary for group survival – chiefly, producing food and shelter and raising children. Individual mothers are not solely responsible for their children; in foragers, the whole group contributes to child care.
You might imagine this unified labor strategy then changed in early modern humans, but archaeological and anatomical evidence shows it did not. Upper Paleolithic modern humans leaving Africa and entering Europe and Asia show very few sexed differences in trauma and repetitive motion wear. One difference is more evidence of “thrower’s elbow” in males than females, though some females shared these pathologies.
And this was also the time when people were innovating with hunting technologies like atlatls, fishing hooks and nets, and bow and arrows – alleviating some of the wear and tear hunting would take on their bodies. A recent archaeological experiment found that using atlatls decreased sex differences in the speed of spears thrown by contemporary men and women.
Even in death, there are no sexed differences in how Neanderthals or modern humans buried their dead, or the goods affiliated with their graves. These indicators of differential gendered social status do not arrive until agriculture, with its stratified economic system and monopolizable resources.
All this evidence suggests paleolithic women and men did not occupy differing roles or social realms.

Critics might point to recent forager populations and suggest that since they are using subsistence strategies similar to our ancient ancestors, their gendered roles are inherent to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
However, there are many flaws in this approach. Foragers are not living fossils, and their social structures and cultural norms have evolved over time and in response to patriarchal agricultural neighbors and colonial administrators. Additionally, ethnographers of the last two centuries brought their sexism with them into the field, and it biased how they understood forager societies. For instance, a recent reanalysis showed that 79% of cultures described in ethnographic data included descriptions of women hunting; however, previous interpretations frequently left them out.
Time to shake these caveman myths
The myth that female reproductive capabilities somehow render them incapable of gathering any food products beyond those that cannot run away does more than just underestimate Paleolithic women. It feeds into narratives that the contemporary social roles of women and men are inherent and define our evolution. Our Paleolithic ancestors lived in a world where everyone in the band pulled their own weight, performing multiple tasks. It was not a utopia, but it was not a patriarchy.
Certainly accommodations must have been made for group members who were sick, recovering from childbirth or otherwise temporarily incapacitated. But pregnancy, lactation, child-rearing and menstruation are not permanently disabling events, as researchers found among the living Agta of the Philippines who continue to hunt during these life periods.
Suggesting that the female body is only designed to gather plants ignores female physiology and the archaeological record. To ignore the evidence perpetuates a myth that only serves to bolster existing power structures.",Forget ‘Man the Hunter’ – physiological and archaeological evidence rewrites assumptions about a gendered division of labor in prehistoric times,science + tech
"If you have ever cared for a pet dog, it is a sad truth that you are likely to outlive them. So it’s no wonder that people may be asking how to increase their pet’s longevity following the news that a dog in Portugal lived longer than 30 years.
The Guinness World Record Holder of the title of World’s Oldest Dog, Bobi, has recently died aged 31. This is an impressive age for any dog. Smaller dogs typically live longer than larger breeds but the average dog will get to around 13 years old before age inevitably catches up with them.
Bobi apparently lived a relatively unrestricted life in the Portuguese countryside, eating the same food as his human caregivers and enjoying free roam of the nearby forestland. His unusual longevity has been attributed to this lifestyle. While there is some debate about Bobi’s actual age, his diet and lifestyle, unsurprisingly, has attracted much attention from canine caregivers.
There is a lot we don’t understand about ageing but there are common factors associated with longevity for many species. These factors seem to help increase lifespans in species as varied as the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans, dogs and humans. This suggests that other species can be useful models in helping us understand our own ageing process.
So, what practical measures can we take to help ourselves and our dogs live as long and healthy lives as possible?
Eat a nutritious diet
Bobi reportedly ate the same food as his owners. But dogs and humans have different nutritional needs. This means that feeding your dog the same food you eat is unlikely to meet their requirements and could even be dangerous.
However, diet does affect ageing. In humans, a diet low in saturated fat and high in fruit and vegetables  supports healthy ageing.
For dogs, increased levels of antioxidants support energy generation in the body’s cells and aid learning and brain health in older dogs. These include vitamins C and E, and nutrients such as alpha-lipoic acid (found in red meat and organ meats) and L-cartinine (also found in red meat). These nutrients are typically provided in fortified, prepared dog food.
If you feed your dog a commercial diet, check it is labelled as “complete”. This ensures that if you feed the recommended amount, your dog will be getting all the nutrients at the right levels to meet their needs. Home-prepared dog diets are often deficient in key nutrients, unless they are carefully prepared.
Wouldn’t you want this dog to stay healthy as long as possible? el-ka/Shutterstock
Keep active
Physical activity is often linked to healthy ageing. Studies suggest that dogs living in rural areas and large dogs are more active than their older, smaller and urban counterparts. Interestingly, older caregivers also have more active dogs compared to younger dog owners.
Walking is a simple way to support maintenance of a healthy body weight in dogs and their caregivers, leading to mutual health benefits. Age, size, breed, health and other variables will affect the amount of exercise a dog needs. For example, dogs originally bred to work and be highly active, such as collies and spaniels, are likely to need more physical activity (intensity and duration) than toy breeds such as pugs, who might be happy with a gentle wander around the neighbourhood.
But almost without exception, walking and other activity is good for our dogs. It can also mean that you and your dog are happier, another key factor linked to healthy ageing.
Maintain a healthy body weight
Excess body weight is associated with reduced health and lifespan in dogs and people. Research consistently indicates that a degree of calorie restriction and a lean body weight is associated with increased longevity in a range of species. Somewhat paradoxically, photographs of Bobi suggest that he was carrying rather more body weight that would be considered healthy for a typical dog of his size.
Regular monitoring of your dog’s (and your own!) body weight is a good way to maintain a healthy waistline and support longevity. It is important to know what a healthy body weight and shape looks and feels like for your own dog. Many caregivers fail to recognise what a healthy, lean animal should look like and others underestimate how much excess weight their pets are carrying.
With practice, you can become familiar with a healthy body shape by checking that your dog has a defined waistline when viewed from above, that you can feel (but not necessarily see) their ribs and that their abdomen tucks up when viewed from the side. You can use breed specific resources to understand more about the physical shapes of some dogs.
Feeding your dog a suitable amount to meet their nutritional needs while maintaining a lean body weight can help reduce the chances they will develop painful and distressing conditions such as osteoarthritis.
With some simple dietary and lifestyle interventions, we can make sure our shared lives with our dogs are as happy, healthy and long as possible. Our companion dogs might not reach 31 years old, but we can certainly make mutual longevity an aim.",What the world’s oldest dog can tell us about ageing,science + tech

Will it ever be possible for time travel to occur? – Alana C., age 12, Queens, New York
Have you ever dreamed of traveling through time, like characters do in science fiction movies? For centuries, the concept of time travel has captivated people’s imaginations. Time travel is the concept of moving between different points in time, just like you move between different places. In movies, you might have seen characters using special machines, magical devices or even hopping into a futuristic car to travel backward or forward in time.
But is this just a fun idea for movies, or could it really happen?
The question of whether time is reversible remains one of the biggest unresolved questions in science. If the universe follows the laws of thermodynamics, it may not be possible. The second law of thermodynamics states that things in the universe can either remain the same or become more disordered over time.
It’s a bit like saying you can’t unscramble eggs once they’ve been cooked. According to this law, the universe can never go back exactly to how it was before. Time can only go forward, like a one-way street.
Time is relative
However, physicist Albert Einstein’s theory of special relativity suggests that time passes at different rates for different people. Someone speeding along on a spaceship moving close to the speed of light – 671 million miles per hour! – will experience time slower than a person on Earth.
People have yet to build spaceships that can move at speeds anywhere near as fast as light, but astronauts who visit the International Space Station orbit around the Earth at speeds close to 17,500 mph. Astronaut Scott Kelly has spent 520 days at the International Space Station, and as a result has aged a little more slowly than his twin brother – and fellow astronaut – Mark Kelly. Scott used to be 6 minutes younger than his twin brother. Now, because Scott was traveling so much faster than Mark and for so many days, he is 6 minutes and 5 milliseconds younger.
Time isn’t the same everywhere.
Some scientists are exploring other ideas that could theoretically allow time travel. One concept involves wormholes, or hypothetical tunnels in space that could create shortcuts for journeys across the universe. If someone could build a wormhole and then figure out a way to move one end at close to the speed of light – like the hypothetical spaceship mentioned above – the moving end would age more slowly than the stationary end. Someone who entered the moving end and exited the wormhole through the stationary end would come out in their past.
However, wormholes remain theoretical: Scientists have yet to spot one. It also looks like it would be incredibly challenging to send humans through a wormhole space tunnel.
Paradoxes and failed dinner parties
There are also paradoxes associated with time travel. The famous “grandfather paradox” is a hypothetical problem that could arise if someone traveled back in time and accidentally prevented their grandparents from meeting. This would create a paradox where you were never born, which raises the question: How could you have traveled back in time in the first place? It’s a mind-boggling puzzle that adds to the mystery of time travel.
Famously, physicist Stephen Hawking tested the possibility of time travel by throwing a dinner party where invitations noting the date, time and coordinates were not sent out until after it had happened. His hope was that his invitation would be read by someone living in the future, who had capabilities to travel back in time. But no one showed up.
As he pointed out: “The best evidence we have that time travel is not possible, and never will be, is that we have not been invaded by hordes of tourists from the future.”
Telescopes are time machines
Interestingly, astrophysicists armed with powerful telescopes possess a unique form of time travel. As they peer into the vast expanse of the cosmos, they gaze into the past universe. Light from all galaxies and stars takes time to travel, and these beams of light carry information from the distant past. When astrophysicists observe a star or a galaxy through a telescope, they are not seeing it as it is in the present, but as it existed when the light began its journey to Earth millions to billions of years ago.
Telescopes are a kind of time machine – they let you peer into the past.
NASA’s newest space telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, is peering at galaxies that were formed at the very beginning of the Big Bang, about 13.7 billion years ago.
While we aren’t likely to have time machines like the ones in movies anytime soon, scientists are actively researching and exploring new ideas. But for now, we’ll have to enjoy the idea of time travel in our favorite books, movies and dreams.

"We are so fortunate to share the world with a huge diversity of creatures. For me, some of the most fascinating are reptiles and amphibians. Collectively called herpetofauna, reptiles and amphibians are ectotherms; they rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature.
A person like me who works with these groups of animals is called a herpetologist. Among the reptiles and amphibians, my special interest is in snakes. I’ve always been interested in reptiles, from the days when I would chase common flat lizards in the Motobo Hills in Zimbabwe, where I grew up, and interact with snakes and other animals at our local rehabilitation centre.
Still, if somebody had told my teenage self that my job would entail working with snakes and encouraging other people to appreciate them, I never would have believed them.

Most people will be familiar with zoology, the branch of biology that focuses on the study of all animals. Some animals have their own speciality within the discipline of zoology. Herps (a slang term for herpetofauna) are one example.
There are over 4,000 species of snakes around the world. Each species has a unique adaptation to its own environment. Some snakes, like puff adders, are scentless as a way to camouflage themselves from predators. Others, like southern African pythons, show maternal care, which is very unusual for snakes and much more common in mammals and birds.

These unique adaptations have allowed snakes to thrive in different environments. This makes them a great model in science: herpetologists can ask questions about their physiology, evolution, ecology and biology.
For anyone looking to become a herpetologist, a basic zoology degree will get you started. Most universities will have someone who specialises in teaching herpetology or someone who can point you in the right direction. Volunteering at institutions that have reptiles, like zoos, is also a great way to get some experience working with them. Once you get to postgraduate level, you can specialise in one of many different topics in herpetology and apply different techniques to answer questions that you are curious about.
As a specialist in reptiles and amphibians, you can merge that interest with other disciplines like photography, law or conservation, and this can open up many job opportunities. You can also pursue further research at a university, become a lecturer or school teacher, work at a zoo or become a museum curator. There are many options to explore.
My research
I completed my MSc in 2017 and my research focused on the evolution of diet in a group of snakes called lamprophiids. I loved learning about how diverse snakes are in the food they eat. For my PhD, I wanted my research to have a real-world application, so I waited until 2021 to start after getting some work experience in conservation.

My current research focuses on the way that snakes behave (behavioural ecology) to answer some of the bigger question of what leads snakes to bite people. Another year and I will have some answers for you on this.

Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease according to the World Health Organization and affects millions of people around the world. When natural spaces are transformed and destroyed, many animals, like snakes, go looking for food and shelter – often in people’s homes. Many people are afraid of snakes, so encounters often lead to conflict as people try to kill the animals and get bitten in the process.
I am also fortunate to work for a non-profit organisation, Save The Snakes, which allows me to educate people about snakes and do my part to conserve them by applying my research. My job includes researching information on snakes that live in different parts of South Africa and assessing threats to them, like habitat transformation, learning more about the relationship between humans and snakes, conducting fieldwork and running experiments to understand more about the behaviour and ecology of snakes.
The circle of life
I’m also passionate about education.
Learning about the world of snakes has allowed me to appreciate the natural world in a unique way. As predators and prey, snakes are an emblem of the circle of life. One of my favourite activities is going out at night looking for them (called “herping”) and watching them display different behaviours. After the summer rains, frogs and insects come out and the snake predators follow. When I take these moments to observe the world around me I feel fortunate to appreciate these animals in a way most people don’t. This is the feeling I like to share in my education efforts.

Some of my favourite moments in my current job have involved seeing the change in people’s perceptions about snakes. Snakes have been feared for many generations because of misinformation. Most snakes are harmless. They don’t chase people, and they stay hidden much of the time. By sharing the correct information about snakes, we show that fear can be changed to curiosity and that creates more motivation to learn about them.","Do you like snakes, lizards and frogs?

"On the shores of Lake Turkana in east Africa, about 5,000 to 4,000 years ago, pastoralists buried their dead in communal cemeteries that were marked by stone circles and pillars. The north-west Kenya “pillar sites” were built around the same time as Stonehenge in the UK. But these places have a different story to tell: about how mortuary traditions reflect people’s environments, behaviours and reactions to change.
The burial sites appeared at a time of major environmental and economic change in the region. The Sahara, which received enough rainfall 9,000-7,000 years ago to sustain populations of fisher-hunter-gatherers and pastoralists, was drying, causing groups of people to move east and south. Even in eastern Africa, lake levels were dropping dramatically; grassy plains were expanding. Around Lake Turkana, people began herding animals in addition to fishing and foraging.
At several of the pillar sites around Lake Turkana, archaeologists have found that hundreds of people were ceremonially interred under large, circular platform mounds. Many of those individuals were found wearing remarkable colourful stone beads, some as part of necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other jewellery worn, for example, around the waist. These beautiful personal ornaments include blue-green amazonite, soft pink zeolite, deep red chalcedony, purple fluorite and green talc, among other minerals and rocks.
I study relationships between humans and their environments, especially at times of major economic transformations, using scientific techniques applied to archaeology. I recently led a team of experts in geology and archaeology of the region to conduct the first comprehensive mineralogical analysis of the Turkana stone beads.
The focus of our study was to discover what types of minerals and rocks the early herders had used to make adornments, and where these materials came from.
This kind of information can tell archaeologists about the role of artefacts in the society that used them.
Wearing beads
Humans have been making and wearing beads for over 140,000 years. Beads are one of the oldest forms of symbolism and are often used as adornment in a culture. Wearing something on your body is an expressive choice that can have many meanings, such as protection, acknowledgement of friendships and bonds, status or role in society. Personal ornaments like beads may indicate a common cultural understanding.
Analysis of beads in archaeological sites has shown that we can learn many things from them.
At the Turkana pillar sites, the stone bead tradition was clearly important, partly because of the number of beads found accompanying burials, and partly because the practice persisted for hundreds of years.
Knowing the range of materials helps us understand landscape use in the past: where people were buried, where they watered their animals, seasonal movements for grazing, special yearly trips to significant places and other movements. Pastoralists recorded or marked their worlds by what they left behind and what they took with them. Patterns in the composition of the bead collections may indicate there was communication and exchange of objects across the region.
Sorting the stone beads
Of the six pillar sites that have been excavated by archaeologists, three have yielded substantial assemblages of stone beads: Lothagam North, Manemanya and Jarigole. Our team began by sorting the stone beads by site, and by their mineral and rock types.
Our study identified the mineral characteristics of 806 stone beads. We looked at properties like specific gravity, crystal and molecular structure, and the characteristic emissions that are particular to certain minerals.

What we found was a strikingly diverse set of beads that varied by site. The visual characteristics of some of the beads – colour, lustre and so on – may have made them particularly valuable or had a special meaning economically, socially, spiritually or symbolically. Their source and workability may also have given them a certain value.
Pink zeolites and turquoise amazonites were the most common stone beads at the site of Lothagam North, comprising over three-quarters of the assemblage. This was very similar to the site of Jarigole, located across the lake. The sites are hundreds of kilometres apart, with Lake Turkana in between – suggesting a cultural connection between them.
Beads from a single burial at Manemanya. Carla Klehm, Author provided (no reuse)
In contrast, the kinds of beads at Manemanya were different: mostly softer and paler pink and off-white calcite beads that were quite large. Further, while at Lothagam North there often were just a few beads found with any individual, one person at Manemanya was buried with over 300 stone beads and over 10,000 ostrich eggshell beads.
This suggests that although having stone beads was a commonality across the sites, distinctions – and distinct meanings for different people – did exist.
Sourcing stones
We also wanted to know whether the beads were produced from local sources (within a few days’ walk) or acquired through long-distance journeys or trade. Sourcing allows us to partially reconstruct how the earliest pastoralists moved around the landscape during the year.
A survey of the areas west of Lake Turkana and a search of the published literature on the geology of the region identified places where these materials might have come from.
Lake Turkana pillar sites. Carla Klehm. Map by Mark Helper
There are possible sources for most of these materials within about 150km of the pillar sites. Limestone rocks may have been procured easily near the lake. Some of the tougher materials, like the chalcedonies, could have been carried to the lake area by rivers, to be picked up perhaps by someone watering cattle or fetching water from a stream. Other minerals come from a specific source. The variety of bead types demonstrates that people knew their landscape well.
Sometimes, they went out of their way to get certain minerals, or perhaps traded for them. The closest known sources for amazonite and fluorite are, respectively,  225 km, in southern Ethiopia; and  350 km, near the modern city of Eldoret, Kenya.
These suggest that bead making was not just a casual affair; material selection was intentional.
Local landscapes
Early herders in the Turkana Basin obtained materials from both local and distant places, and shaped them into personal adornments. These stone beads were placed with the dead, in numbers and combinations that differed by individual and place. We don’t yet fully know what they meant – but future research in the Turkana Basin will continue to explore the lives and legacies of these pioneering herders as they negotiated new environmental and social landscapes.
Edits and comments for this article were provided by Late Prehistory of West Turkana project co-directors Drs. Elizabeth Hildebrand and Katherine Grillo, project minerologist Mark Helper, and Emmanuel Ndiema, who helped lead the sourcing study.","Turkana stone beads tell a story of herder life in a drying east Africa 5,000 years ago",science + tech
"Nigeria’s new works minister, David Umahi, is pushing for the use of rigid pavement in road construction, as against the flexible pavement predominantly in use. This, as the minister noted, is due to the precarious state of flexible pavements in the country.
A rigid pavement is a road surface overlaid with reinforced concrete, while a flexible or asphalt one has a bituminous (tar) overlay.
Asphalt roads are the most common type of paved roads in Nigeria. Examples include the Lagos-Ibadan, Port Harcourt-Enugu, Lokoja-Abuja and Abuja-Kaduna expressways. Concrete roads include the Kaba-Obajana road in Kogi State and Apapa-Oshodi road in Lagos State.
Road infrastructure is essential in modern economies. Economic growth and development requires mobility and accessibility.
As a professor of engineering who has researched the use of reinforced concrete and asphalt on Nigerian roads, I offer some insights into the issues raised by the minister’s decision.
The choice is between additional service and higher cost or reduced service and lower cost. This is a design challenge. The decision is not only technical, but also political.
However, there is no data to speak categorically on whether concrete pavement is better than flexible pavement for Nigeria.
Comparison of flexible and rigid pavements
Rigid pavements are generally more expensive and difficult to install and maintain. They’re made out of a cement concrete with a base, sub base and subgrade underlay. Unlike flexible pavement, rigid pavements have a high flexural strength, making every layer virtually immune to bending under pressure. Flexural strength is the material’s ability to resist deformation under load.
Flexible pavement is designed to bend and deflect according to external factors like traffic loads. Essentially, it is more adaptable to the elements to which it’s exposed. The initial cost of construction is low and with excellent regular maintenance, it has a lifespan of about 10-15 years. Regular maintenance is required for this type of pavement, and repair work is fairly easy.
Flexible pavements have low initial cost, but higher maintenance cost.
Comparatively, rigid pavements have high initial cost, but low maintenance cost.
Asphalt has a relatively smaller surface area of subgrade compared to a wider surface area for reinforced concrete. Subgrade is the material underneath the pavement structure.
Flexible pavements usually last for 10 to 15 years while rigid pavements last for 25 to 30 years.
There’s a higher water penetration rate for flexible pavement but lower rate for rigid pavement. The longer moisture remains in a flexible (asphalt) pavement structure the more likely pavement failure will occur. In particular, the continuous presence of moisture in a pavement subgrade can significantly affect the subgrade’s modulus and reduce pavement performance. Subgrade modulus is a conceptual relationship between applied pressure and deflection for a plate resting on an elastic support system.
Night driving is better on rigid pavements due to the light coloured surface.
Extreme weather like high temperature affects flexible pavements but not rigid pavements. In flexible pavements, temperature fluctuations have a significant impact on structural performance, including stress and strain.
Noise pollution is also high on flexible pavements but lower on rigid pavements.
The way to go
The choice of any type of pavement depends on the life cycle and costs of materials, which include initial construction cost, maintenance and repair cost, and cost associated with environment factors such as emissions and energy consumption.
Consequently, a life cycle cost analysis should be carried out before choosing a pavement type.
A well-designed road will provide the intended level of service at an acceptable level of safety. It will also reflect local values and policy, which will vary from location to location, and it will place appropriate importance on cost, environmental values and appearance. These should guide the country’s decision on the issue.
Asphalt roads (flexible pavement) have less initial cost of construction, lower construction and repair periods, they are quicker to repair, absorb traffic noise and can be recycled, thereby reducing waste. However, asphalt has a short life span, requires frequent maintenance, is less able to carry heavy traffic and so is more suitable for light traffic in residential streets and rural roads. It also has a greater carbon imprint, which is detrimental to the environment, as a result of bitumen production.
Concrete roads have a heavy construction cost, longer construction period due to the time required for curing, and longer repair times. They have a longer life span, low maintenance cost, high durability, and high load bearing capability, ideal for heavy traffic areas such as highways, ports and airports. Concrete roads have a lower carbon imprint from the production of cement, and are less prone to developing pot holes, reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions.",Concrete versus asphalt for Nigeria’s roads: which is better?,science + tech
"Artificial intelligence is changing the world – and one of the main areas it will affect in the short-to-medium term is the workforce.
AI algorithms imitate real-world systems. The more repetitive a system is, the easier it is for AI to replace it. That’s why jobs in customer service, retail and clerical roles are regularly named as being the most at risk.
That doesn’t mean other jobs won’t be affected. The latest advances in AI have shown all kinds of creative work and white-collar professions stand to be impacted to various degrees.
However, there’s one important point that’s usually not addressed in discussions about AI’s impact on jobs. That is: where you work may be as important as what you do.
Current trends and projections suggest people in developing countries, where a higher proportion of jobs involve repetitive or manual tasks, will be the first and most affected.

Privileged by geography
According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report, emerging technologies and digitalisation are among the biggest driving factors for job displacement. The report states:
The majority of fastest declining roles are clerical or secretarial roles, with bank tellers and related clerks, postal service clerks, cashiers and ticket clerks, and data entry clerks expected to decline fastest.
Let’s take an office clerk as an example, whose responsibilities include answering phones, taking messages and scheduling appointments. We now have access to AI tools that can perform all these tasks.
They can also work non-stop, for free (or a fraction of the price), without being affected by personal problems, and without having to mentally strain to optimise their workflow. Of course they’re going to be attractive to employers!
At first glance, you might assume an office clerk living in a developed country is more likely to lose their job than their counterpart in a developing country, since the former seems more likely to implement new AI tools.
In reality, however, it’s expected more people in developing countries will lose their jobs. The success of each nation will depend on how well it can adapt to the displacement of its workforce.
In 2009, the United Nations International Telecommunication Union created the information and communication technologies (ICT) development index to benchmark and compare ICT performance within and across countries.
This index measures, among other things:
the level and evolution over time of information and communication technologies in different countries
how each country’s experience compares to others’
the extent to which a country can develop and use these technologies to boost its own growth and development in the context of the capabilities and skills available.
In other words, a country’s score on this index can be correlated with how well it adapts to emerging technologies such as AI.
Unsurprisingly, developed countries rank higher than the rest of the world. In 2012, the top five ranking countries were the Republic of Korea, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Finland. The bottom five were Eritrea, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Central African Republic and Niger.

Wealth and opportunity makes a difference
The World Bank has divided the world by income and region, showing developing countries are among the lowest earners.
Generally speaking, employing people is much easier in developing countries, due to lower wages, tighter competition and less regulation to support employees.
The World Bank estimates about 84% of the world’s working-age population lives in developing countries. Similarly, a 2008 report from the International Labour Organisation estimated 73% of all the world’s workers lived in developing countries, while only 14% lived in advanced industrial countries.
That means whatever clerical jobs aren’t taken by AI in developing countries will become more competitive than most people can handle. As World Bank senior economist Indhira Santos wrote in 2016, in reference to the digital revolution:
[…] the jobs where workers are likely to lose out are disproportionally held by the least educated and the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. As a result, the biggest risk from the digital revolution is not massive unemployment, but widening income inequality.
These factors will result in an employer-ruled ecosystem in developing countries. These countries have both a higher occurrence of jobs that can be replaced or displaced (such as call centre jobs), and less of the money and skills needed to implement AI tools effectively.
The cost and affordability of AI programs and algorithms will also speed up this process in certain regions.
Critical thinking remains important
Experts note AI will create many employment opportunities, including jobs that don’t yet exist. It’s just that not all countries will be well-equipped to make the transition when the time comes.
The Future of Jobs report says “analytical thinking and creative thinking remain the most important skills for workers”. So if you’re worried about keeping your job in the future, it’s worth acquiring more of these skills.
Beyond that, you might stop and consider how the place you live could play a role in whether you’ll have work in the future – and if you happen to live in a wealthy, developed country, consider yourself lucky.

"Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate media content, including news, to engage their customers. Now, we’re even seeing AI used for the “gamification” of news – that is, to create interactivity associated with news content.
For better or worse, AI is changing the nature of news media. And we’ll have to wise up if we want to protect the integrity of this institution.
How did she die?
Imagine you’re reading a tragic article about the death of a young sports coach at a prestigious Sydney school.
In a box to the right is a poll asking you to speculate about the cause of death. The poll is AI-generated. It’s designed to keep you engaged with the story, as this will make you more likely to respond to advertisements provided by the poll’s operator.
This scenario isn’t hypothetical. It was played out in The Guardian’s recent reporting on the death of Lilie James.
Under a licensing agreement, Microsoft republished The Guardian’s story on its news app and website Microsoft Start. The poll was based on the content of the article and displayed alongside it, but The Guardian had no involvement or control over it.
If the article had been about an upcoming sports fixture, a poll on the likely outcome would have been harmless. Yet this example shows how problematic it can be when AI starts to mingle with news pages, a product traditionally curated by experts.
The incident led to reasonable anger. In a letter to Microsoft president Brad Smith, Guardian Media Group chief executive Anna Bateson said it was “an inappropriate use of genAI [generative AI]”, which caused “significant reputational damage” to The Guardian and the journalist who wrote the story.
Naturally, the poll was removed. But it raises the question: why did Microsoft let it happen in the first place?
The consequence of omitting common sense
The first part of the answer is that supplementary news products such as polls and quizzes actually do engage readers, as research by the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas has found.
Given how cheap it is to use AI for this purpose, it seems likely news businesses (and businesses displaying others’ news) will continue to do so.
The second part of the answer is there was no “human in the loop”, or limited human involvement, in the Microsoft incident.
The major providers of large language models – the models that underpin various AI programs – have a financial and reputational incentive to make sure their programs don’t cause harm. Open AI with its GPT- models and DAll-E, Google with PaLM 2 (used in Bard), and Meta with its downloadable Llama 2 have all made significant efforts to ensure their models don’t generate harmful content.
They often do this through a process called “reinforcement learning”, where humans curate responses to questions that might lead to harm. But this doesn’t always prevent the models from producing inappropriate content.
Read more: Ageism, sexism, classism and more: 7 examples of bias in AI-generated images
It’s likely Microsoft was relying on the low-harm aspects of its AI, rather than considering how to minimise harm that may arise through the actual use of the model. The latter requires common sense – a trait that can’t be programmed into large language models.
Thousands of AI-generated articles per week
Generative AI is becoming accessible and affordable. This makes it attractive to commercial news businesses, which have been reeling from losses of revenue. As such, we’re now seeing AI “write” news stories, saving companies from having to pay journalist salaries.
In June, News Corp executive chair Michael Miller revealed the company had a small team that produced about 3,000 articles a week using AI.
Essentially, the team of four ensures the content makes sense and doesn’t include “hallucinations”: false information made up by a model when it can’t predict a suitable response to an input.
While this news is likely to be accurate, the same tools can be used to generate potentially misleading content parading as news, and nearly indistinguishable from articles written by professional journalists.
Since April, a NewsGuard investigation has found hundreds of websites, written in several languages, that are mostly or entirely generated by AI to mimic real news sites. Some of these included harmful misinformation, such as the claim that US President Joe Biden had died.
It’s thought the sites, which were teeming with ads, were likely generated to get ad revenue.
Read more: This week's changes are a win for Facebook, Google and the government — but what was lost along the way?
As technology advances, so does risk
Generally, many large language models have been limited by their underlying training data. For instance, models trained on data up to 2021 will not provide accurate “news” about the world’s events in 2022.
However, this is changing, as models can now be fine-tuned to respond to particular sources. In recent months, the use of an AI framework called “retrieval augmented generation” has evolved to allow models to use very recent data.
With this method, it would certainly be possible to use licensed content from a small number of news wires to create a news website.
While this may be convenient from a business standpoint, it’s yet one more potential way that AI could push humans out of the loop in the process of news creation and dissemination.
An editorially curated news page is a valuable and well-thought-out product. Leaving AI to do this work could expose us to all kinds of misinformation and bias (especially without human oversight), or result in a lack of important localised coverage.
Cutting corners could make us all losers
Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code was designed to “level the playing field” between big tech and media businesses. Since the code came into effect, a secondary change is now flowing in from the use of generative AI.
Putting aside click-worthiness, there’s currently no comparison between the quality of news a journalist can produce and what AI can produce.
While generative AI could help augment the work of journalists, such as by helping them sort through large amounts of content, we have a lot to lose if we start to view it as a replacement.

"Timing is everything. For early risers and late-nighters alike, listening to your internal clock may be the key to success. From the classroom to the courtroom and beyond, people perform best on challenging tasks at a time of day that aligns with their circadian rhythm.
Circadian rhythms are powerful internal timekeepers that drive a person’s physiological and intellectual functioning throughout the day. Peaks in these circadian rhythms vary across individuals. Some people, known as larks or morning chronotypes, peak early and feel at their best in the morning. Others, known as owls or evening chronotypes, peak later in the day and perform best in the late afternoon or evening. And some people show neither morning nor evening preferences and are considered neutral chronotypes.
As a researcher seeking ways to improve cognitive function, I’ve explored whether your chronotype affects your mental performance. Understanding the kinds of mental processes that vary – or remain stable – over the course of a day may help people schedule their tasks in a way that optimizes performance.
Your brain has an internal clock that influences how your body functions over the course of a day.
Why your chronotype matters
Chronotype can be measured with a simple questionnaire that assesses things like your perceived alertness, preferred rising and retiring times and performance throughout the day. Even without a questionnaire, most people have a sense of whether they are a lark or an owl or fall somewhere in between. Do you wake up early, without an alarm, feeling sharp? Are you mentally drained and ready for pj’s by nine? If so, you are likely a morning type. Do you sleep late and wake feeling sluggish and foggy? Are you more energized late at night? If so, you are likely an evening type.
People perform best on many challenging mental tasks – from paying attention and learning to solving problems and making complex decisions – when these actions are synchronized with their personal circadian peaks. This is known as the synchrony effect. Whether you are an air traffic controller scanning the radar, a CFO reviewing an earnings report or a high school student learning chemistry, synchrony can affect how well you perform.
Much of the evidence for synchrony effects comes from lab studies that test both larks and owls early in the morning and late in the day. People with strong chronotypes are more vigilant and better able to sustain attention at their peak relative to off-peak times. Their memories are sharper, with better list recall and more success in remembering “to-do” tasks like taking medication.

People are also less prone to mind wandering and less distracted at their optimal time. For example, a study I conducted gave participants three weakly related cue words (such as “ship,” “outer” and “crawl”). They were tasked to find another word that linked all three (such as “space”). When my team and I presented misleading words alongside the cue words (such as “ocean” for ship, “inner” for outer and “baby” for crawl), those who were tested at synchronous times were better at ignoring the misleading words and finding the target solution than those who weren’t.
Synchrony also affects high-level cognitive functions like persuasion, reasoning and decision-making. Studies on consumers have found that people are more discerning, skeptical and analytical at their peak times. They invest more time and effort in assigned tasks and are more likely to search for important information. Consequently, people make better investment decisions, are less prone to bias and are more likely to detect scams.
At off-peak times it takes people longer to solve problems, and they tend to be less careful and more reliant on mental shortcuts, leaving them vulnerable to flashy marketing schemes. Even ethical behavior can be compromised at non-optimal times, as people are more likely to cheat at their off-peak times.
In the classroom and the clinic
The basic mental abilities that are affected by synchrony – including attention, memory and analytical thinking – are all skills that contribute to academic success. This connection is especially significant for teens, who tend to be night owls but typically start school early.
One study randomly assigned over 700 adolescents to exam times in the early morning, late morning or afternoon. Owls had lower scores relative to larks in both morning sessions, but this disadvantage disappeared for owls taking the exam in the afternoon. Early start times may put student owls a step behind larks.
Time of day may also be a consideration when conducting assessments for cognitive disorders like attention-deficit disorder or Alzheimer’s disease. Scheduling time may be particularly significant for older adults, who tend to be larks and often show larger synchrony effects than young adults. Performance is better at peak times on several key neuropsychological measures used to assess these conditions. Failing to consider synchrony may affect the accuracy of diagnoses and subsequently have consequences for clinical trial eligibility and data on treatment effectiveness.

Of course, synchrony doesn’t affect performance on all tasks or for all people. Simple, easy tasks – like recognizing familiar faces or places, dialing a close friend’s phone number or making a favorite recipe – are unlikely to change over the day. Furthermore, young adults who are neither larks nor owls show less variability in performance over the day.
For those who are true early birds or night owls, tackling the toughest mental tasks at times that align with their personal circadian peaks could improve their outcomes. When small improvements in performance offer an essential edge, synchrony may be one secret to success.",What’s your chronotype?

"You are unlikely to have seen one, but wildcats are still clinging on by a claw in Scotland. Most of the cats living in the wild in Scotland are hybrid cats with a mix of wildcat and domestic cat ancestry or feral domestic cats. But my team’s new study showed they lived alongside domestic cats for almost 2,000 years before interbreeding.
One of our rarest and most elusive mammal species, European wildcats have been in decline across across Europe and Britain for the past few hundred years. Wildcats were lost completely from England and Wales by the end of the 19th century and today are only found in the Scottish Highlands.
Habitat loss and hunting are two of the biggest threats facing this species across its range, but in Scotland, hybridisation with domestic cats is now the biggest threat to this population. Interbreeding between the two species is frequent now.
This gradual erosion of the wildcat genome (the DNA instructions for everything that makes a wildcat a wildcat) may lead to the complete extinction of this species in Britain. Among scientists, this is known as genetic swamping.
How long has this been going on?
Although domestic cats and wildcats are different species, genetically more different than dogs and wolves, they look similar. Domestic cats, descended from the African-Asian wildcat, became widespread in Britain in Roman times.
Wildcats in Scotland are a subpopulation of European wildcats, and have been present in Britain since the end of the last ice age, around 10,000 years ago. Our research, which used the genomes of ancient cats from prehistoric Britain (around 6,000BC) until the present, shows that the two species kept themselves separate until very recently.
This may be expected for two species such as these, which have different patterns of behaviour and habitat preference. Wildcats keep away from people and prefer natural, forested areas – unlike domestic cats which thrive in human-modified environments.
My team’s study showed that around 60 years ago, however, there was a sudden shift to increasingly frequent interbreeding, which quickly overwhelmed the remaining wildcats in Scotland.
What changed?
The recent history of hybridisation between the two species strongly suggests that hybridisation is a symptom, rather than the cause, of wildcat declines in Britain.
Wildcats have been hunted for sport, and are also persecuted as a pest species which keeps their numbers down. Modern land management has involved the felling of large swaths of Scottish forests (often for timber or agriculture), potentially forcing wildcats into more human-dominated environments, where they are more likely to meet a domestic cat.
The 20th century also saw a rise in domestic cat ownership, which is now at an all-time high in the UK. While it can be hard to keep track of feral domestic cat numbers, the population size is likely to significantly outnumber the wildcat population.
Our study highlighted the pressure that disease transmission is putting on wildcat populations. Domestic cats are a known source of feline diseases, such as feline immunodeficiency virus, feline calicivirus and haemoplasma infection, which can be passed to wildcats, and can be deadly.

Our study compared the genomes of hybrid, wildcat and domestic cats. The hybrid population showed genetic patterns suggesting they are developing immunity to these diseases, with the help of genes inherited from domestic cat parents. While this may bring short-term protection from cat diseases, it results in domestic cat DNA hitching along for the ride, perhaps accelerating the effect of genetic swamping.
Without intervention, the few wildcats that remain will interbreed with domestic cats and the wildcat genome will contribute a fraction of a percent to the domestic cat genome. The biological and behavioural adaptations that evolved in the European wildcat will be lost.
Does this matter?
Human behaviour (such as transporting species around the world, encroachment on wild habitats and climate change) is driving an increase in hybridisation globally. Conservationists are debating the level of risk this poses to wildlife populations, and the best course of action for conservation management.

In some cases hybridisation can be beneficial, bringing new genetic diversity that can help species survive in increasingly human-dominated environments. However, the consequences of hybridisation are unpredictable, and it is hard to come up with a solution that works for every case.
For the wildcat, hybridisation is a double-edged sword. It brought disease resistance that aided the population’s short-term survival, but at the cost of threatening the genetic adaptations that made the species unique.
What next for wildcats?
My team’s study highlights the value of the captive wildcat population in the UK. First established in 1960, founders of this population largely predate the onset of hybridisation in Scotland. The captive population now provides an important lifeline to reestablish this species in Britain.
A wildcat conservation breeding for release programme is conducted by Saving Wildcats, a partnership led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. The first releases into the wild started this year, with 19 cats released in the Cairngorms Connect area of the Cairngorms National Park.
Monitoring the newly released cats will give us vital insights about how to protect species like the wildcat. The more we understand about the effects and history of hybridisation, the more we’ll understand about how best to manage wildlife conservation in the future.

"Social media platforms are a great source of information and entertainment. They also help us to maintain contact with friends and family. But social media can also – and has, often – become a toxic environment for spreading disinformation, hatred and conflict.
Most people can’t or don’t want to opt out of social media. Efforts by courts and state bodies to regulate or control it are slowly catching up, but so far have been unsuccessful. And social media companies have a record of prioritising engagement over social benefit.
Users are left with a dilemma: how to benefit from social media without exposing themselves to distressing, damaging or illegal content. This becomes even more of an issue in times of heightened global tension and conflict. Both the conflict in Ukraine and now the Gaza War have increased the risk of seeing horrifying and damaging images on one’s feed.
This article, based on my research on news on social media, is a guide to curating and editing your social media feeds to ensure that the content you see is suited to your needs and is not offensive or disturbing.
It is organised into the broadest social media categories. I’m not covering newer services such as Threads, Mastodon, Post and Bluesky, although the principles are generally applicable. I have focused on using these apps on a mobile phone, because that’s what the majority of users do, rather than using them on a web browser. I am concentrating mostly on video content.
Social media can be a powerful tool for information and learning, but it is a flawed one. Whatever approach you take to managing your feeds, remain cautious and sceptical. Pay attention to updates to policies and user agreements and consider carefully who you trust and follow.
Your choice or theirs?
Many social networks offer an algorithmically selected feed as your first point of contact. The specifics of the algorithms are not publicly known and the companies refine them constantly. The feed is largely based on your location and the topics and people you have expressed an interest in previously (whether following, or simply having watched or interacted with the content). It may also include other information such as your age and gender, which you may have previously given the service.
Read more: Algorithms are moulding and shaping our politics. Here's how to avoid being gamed
Organisations and individuals invest money and time in ensuring that their content will be seen. Advertisers will also pay to have their content shown to customers who meet their criteria. It is also important to remember that paid content is not just goods and services for sale, but may be a political or social agenda – often one that is hidden. This is the basis of fake news and deliberate misinformation.
Here are a few ways to manage your social media feeds.
Be careful who you follow
On all networks except TikTok, the key is carefully selecting the people you follow.
On Twitter (X) the best option is to move away from the “for you” page (which is the default view) and focus on the “following” page. You can’t remove the “for you” page entirely. The “following” feed includes everyone you follow, their tweets and their retweets.
If you are seeing content you don’t want to, you can unfollow, block or mute them.
The simplest way to clean up your Facebook news feed is to “unfriend” accounts. Another option is to “unfollow” someone: you remain friends, they can see your content and engage with it, but their posts won’t appear in your feed unless they mention you or you seek it out. Or you can “take a break” from someone, which is a kind of temporary block. Blocking is the most extreme option. It will remove them and all of their content and hide all of yours from them.
Instagram offers similar options to unfollow and mute (similar to Facebook’s “take a break” option).
TikTok has only limited options for users to filter or curate their feeds. The “following” page only shows creators you are following (and ads). It isn’t and can’t be set as the default view.
The “for you” page is entirely algorithm driven. Clicking on a creator only allows you to follow them, not to hide or block them. You can, however, block specific users. Click on their profile, then the share icon. “Report” and “block” are below the various share options. Blocking removes their content, but not other users’ content that features them.
Explore your settings
Many platforms have options for limiting violent or graphic content. On Facebook this is buried in the Settings menu. From there, click on News Feed, then Reduce. You can’t remove this content, but you can move it down in your feed.
On TikTok, long pressing on the screen brings up the options panel. From there you can report a video; there’s also a “not interested” option to remove that video and others with similar hashtags from your feed. If you click on “details” to see which hashtags will be filtered, you can select specific ones to block. It’s not clear how reliable this is, however – hashtags change over time. A number of hashtags apparently can’t be filtered, but it’s not clear what these are or why they can’t be filtered.
The “content preferences” option under “settings” allows you to filter video keywords. That removes them from your “for you” page, your “following” page, or both.
You can also set TikTok to “restricted mode”. This limits access to “unsuitable content” – an opaque description.
User beware
This is not a perfect guide, since social media is not designed to be controlled by the user. These companies are based on user engagement: the more time you spend on their app, the more money they make. They’re not particularly interested in ensuring the content is helpful or accurate.",Social media content in times of war: an expert guide on how to keep violence off your feeds,science + tech

Is it possible for there to be ghosts? – Madelyn, age 11, Fort Lupton, Colorado
Certainly, lots of people believe in ghosts – a spirit left behind after someone who was alive has died.
In a 2021 poll of 1,000 American adults, 41% said they believe in ghosts, and 20% said they had personally experienced them. If they’re right, that’s more than 50 million spirit encounters in the U.S. alone.
That includes the owner of a retail shop near my home who believes his place is haunted. When I asked what most convinced him of this, he sent me dozens of eerie security camera video clips. He also brought in ghost hunters who reinforced his suspicions.
Some of the videos show small orbs of light gliding around the room. In others, you can hear faint voices and loud bumping sounds when nobody’s there. Others show a book flying off a desk and products jumping off a shelf.
Many ghostly encounters are due to the way your brain interprets certain sights and sounds.
It’s not uncommon for me to hear stories like this. As a sociologist, some of my work looks at beliefs in things like ghosts, aliens, pyramid power and superstitions.
Along with others who practice scientific skepticism, I keep an open mind while maintaining that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Tell me you had a burger for lunch, and I’ll take your word for it. Tell me you shared your fries with Abraham Lincoln’s ghost, and I’ll want more evidence.
In the “spirit” of critical thinking, consider the following three questions:
Are ghosts possible?
People may think they’re experiencing ghosts when they hear strange voices, see moving objects, witness balls or wisps of light or even translucent people.
Yet no one describes ghosts as aging, eating, breathing or using bathrooms – despite plumbers receiving many calls about toilets “ghost-flushing.”
So could ghosts be made of a special kind of energy that hovers and flies without dissipating?
If that’s the case, that means when ghosts glow, move objects and make sounds, they are acting like matter – something that takes up space and has mass, like wood, water, plants and people. Conversely, when passing through walls or vanishing, they must not act like matter.
But centuries of physics research have found nothing like this exists, which is why physicists say ghosts can’t exist.
And so far, there is no proof that any part of a person can continue on after death.
The real truth is out there, says this ghost skeptic.
What’s the evidence?
Never before in history have people recorded so many ghost encounters, thanks in part to mobile phone cameras and microphones. It seems there would be great evidence by now. But scientists don’t have it.
Instead, there are lots of ambiguous recordings sabotaged by bad lighting and faulty equipment. But popular television shows on ghost hunting convince many viewers that blurry images and emotional reactions are proof enough.
As for all the devices ghost hunters use to capture sounds, electrical fields and infrared radiation – they may look scientific, but they’re not. Measurements are worthless without some knowledge of the thing you’re measuring.
When ghost hunters descend on an allegedly haunted location for a night of meandering and measurement, they usually find something they later deem paranormal. It may be a moving door (breeze?), a chill (gap in the floorboards?), a glow (light entering from outside?), electrical fluctuations (old wiring?), or bumps and faint voices (crew in other rooms?).
Whatever happens, ghost hunters will draw a bull’s-eye around it, interpret that as “evidence” and investigate no further.
There’s a scientific explanation for spooky sightings.
Are there alternative explanations?
Personal experiences with ghosts can be misleading due to the limitations of human senses. That’s why anecdotes can’t substitute for objective research. Alleged hauntings usually have plenty of non-ghostly explanations.
One example is that retail establishment in my neighborhood. I reviewed the security camera clips and gathered information about the store’s location and layout, and the exact equipment used in the recordings.
First, the “orbs”: Videos captured many small globes of light seemingly moving around the room.
In reality, the orbs are tiny particles of dust wafting close to the camera lens, made to “bloom” by the camera’s infrared lights. That they appear to float around the room is an optical illusion. Watch any orb video closely and you’ll see they never go behind objects in the room. That’s exactly what you’d expect with dust particles close to the camera lens.
Next, voices and bumps: The shop is in a busy corner mini-mall. Three walls abut sidewalks, loading zones and parking areas; an adjacent store shares the fourth. The security camera mics probably recorded sounds from outdoors, other rooms and the adjacent unit. The owner never checked for these possibilities.
Then, the flying objects: The video shows objects falling off the showroom wall. The shelf rests on adjustable brackets, one of which wasn’t fully seated in its slot. The weight of the shelf caused the bracket to settle into place with a visible jerk. This movement sent some items tumbling off the shelf.
Then, the flying book: I used a simple trick to recreate the event at home: a hidden string taped inside a book’s cover, wrapped around the kitchen island, and tugged by my right hand out of camera range.
Experience the mystery of the flying book.
Now I can’t prove there wasn’t a ghost in the original video. The point is to provide a more plausible explanation than “it must have been a ghost.”
One final consideration: Virtually all ghostly experiences involve impediments to making accurate perceptions and judgments – bad lighting, emotional arousal, sleep phenomena, social influences, culture, a misunderstanding of how recording devices work, and the prior beliefs and personality traits of those who claim to see ghosts. All of these hold the potential to induce unforgettable ghostly encounters.
But all can be explained without ghosts being real.

"In the 1970s and 1980s, pine trees growing in various forestry plantations in South Africa’s Western Cape province began to die in patches. These trees succumbed to a mysterious root disease and the patches expanded gradually. Spontaneous regrowth of seedlings in the patches died dramatically.
As in many other true crime dramas, the finger was initially pointed at the most likely suspect: the root-infecting Phytophthora cinnamomi. Its name – plant (phyto) destroyer (phthora) – reveals its power to cause harm; the pathogen is known to cause disease in almost 5,000 different plants.
After further investigation and the collection of many samples, tree pathologists shifted the blame onto the fungus Leptographium serpens (now known as Leptographium alacre). This fungus is well known to be transported by insects and was previously only known in Europe. It was visually identified from the roots of the dying trees. Now it was the prime suspect.
Doubts lingered, though. Most Leptographium species are not known to act as primary disease agents and so L. serpens was most likely not able to cause the disease. Other fungi were also found within the roots of the diseased trees but could not be identified at the time due to a lack of more advanced techniques.
Knowing that the then-available technologies could not provide the complete answer to this mystery, the pathologists took more samples from the dead and dying pine trees, and stored them carefully. The hope was that one day they would have a better idea of the cause of this disease outbreak.
Fast forward to 2023 and a new character enters the mystery: DNA sequencing. This modern technology did what wasn’t possible a few decades ago, allowing our team of molecular mycologists to identify the real culprit.
This tale is a testament to the ever-evolving nature of scientific inquiry. It reinforces the idea that, in the pursuit of knowledge, no stone should be left unturned and no assumption should be taken for granted. Through a blend of perseverance, technology, and a touch of serendipity, it was possible to solve a decades-old mystery.
Tracking a killer
Back in the 1980s the samples were stored in the culture collection of the Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute at the University of Pretoria. In 2020, the samples were revived by a team that included ourselves and several others who recently published a paper on the topic.
We sequenced the samples’ DNA to reveal their unique genetic code. By comparing this code against genetic databases, it was possible to figure out exactly what was causing the tree disease. And so, more than four decades after the disease was first described, the pathogen was finally identified as Rhizina undulata. L. serpens, the long time primary suspect, was finally exonerated.
The culprit: Rhizina undulata Michael Wingfield, Author provided (no reuse)
Rhizina undulata is well known to cause tree disease and death, mainly in Europe. This fungus is known colloquially as the “coffee fire fungus” because the intense heat caused by fires made by campers in a forest to brew coffee activates its dormant spores. This allows it to colonise the roots of conifers, including pines. R. undulata is also well known in South Africa, where it kills many pines in the aftermath of forest fire and when trees are felled to clear a plantation.
What remains a mystery, however, is the trigger that activated this fungus in the Western Cape plantations. No fires were known to have occurred during the relevant time period.
One potential clue to the trigger may lie in the soil in which these trees were planted. Known as Table Mountain sandstone, this soil is sandy and acidic. Acidic soil has been shown in the laboratory to encourage R. undulata growth. This naturally occurring acidity may have been the nudge the pathogen needed to infect the pine trees. It is also possible that the fungus was activated by heat radiating from the quartz rocks that are common in the areas in which the dying trees were planted.
It pays to be patient
In the years since the mysterious Western Cape outbreak, R. undulata has become well known to foresters in pine plantations in other parts of South Africa and has done great damage to newly planted trees after fires. These fires can be accidental or due to what is known as slash-burning after trees are harvested.
Identifying R. undulata as the culprit in those (no longer active) Western Cape plantations means scientists have more data that might help to better understand the biology of the fungus – which may lead to better control strategies in the future.
Our work is also a testament to the timeliness of scientific progress and the importance of patience. This story could only be fully unravelled when more advanced techniques were developed. It shows the power of modern technologies to solve historical problems. This underlines the need for continued investment into research and the development of new tools, both in South Africa and worldwide.
Our study also strongly advocates for the preservation of diverse fungal cultures for extended periods of time, regardless of their perceived importance at the time they are collected. The lack of accessible culture collections for lesser-known fungi, in South Africa and internationally, highlights the need for innovative approaches to safeguard these invaluable resources. This shift could revolutionise the study of microbes, opening new avenues beyond traditional species descriptions.",A mystery disease hit South Africa’s pine trees 40 years ago: new DNA technology has found the killer,science + tech
"Excavations on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi have uncovered two unique and deadly artefacts dating back some 7,000 years – tiger shark teeth that were used as blades.
These finds, reported in the journal Antiquity, are some of the earliest archaeological evidence globally for the use of shark teeth in composite weapons – weapons made with multiple parts. Until now, the oldest such shark-tooth blades found were less than 5,000 years old.
Modified tiger shark teeth found in 7,000-year-old layers of Leang Panninge (top) and Leang Bulu’ Sipong 1 (bottom) on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. M.C. Langley
Our international team used a combination of scientific analysis, experimental reproduction and observations of recent human communities to determine that the two modified shark teeth had once been attached to handles as blades. They were most likely used in ritual or warfare.
7,000-year-old teeth
The two shark teeth were recovered during excavations as part of a joint Indonesian-Australian archaeological research program. Both specimens were found in archaeological contexts attributed to the Toalean culture – an enigmatic foraging society that lived in southwestern Sulawesi from around 8,000 years ago until an unknown period in the recent past.
The shark teeth are of a similar size and came from tiger sharks (Galeocerda cuvier) that were approximately two metres long. Both teeth are perforated.
A complete tooth, found at the cave site of Leang Panninge, has two holes drilled through the root. The other – found at a cave called Leang Bulu’ Sipong 1 – has one hole, though is broken and likely originally also had two holes.
Microscopic examination of the teeth found they had once been tightly fixed to a handle using plant-based threads and a glue-like substance. The adhesive used was a combination of mineral, plant and animal materials.
The same method of attachment is seen on modern shark-tooth blades used by cultures throughout the Pacific.
Scratches and a ground section on the tip of the Leang Panninge shark tooth indicate its use by people 7,000 years ago. M.C. Langley
Examination of the edges of each tooth found they had been used to pierce, cut and scrape flesh and bone. However, far more damage was present than a shark would naturally accrue during feeding.
While these residues superficially suggest Toalean people were using shark-tooth knives as everyday cutting implements, ethnographic (observations of recent communities), archaeological and experimental data suggest otherwise.
Grooves and traces of red resin along the base of the Leang Panninge tooth show how the teeth were attached using threads. M.C. Langley
Why use shark teeth?
Not surprisingly, our experiments found tiger shark-tooth knives were equally effective in creating long, deep gashes in the skin when used to strike (as in fighting) as when butchering a leg of fresh pork.
Indeed, the only negative aspect is that the teeth blunt relatively quickly – too quickly to make their use as an everyday knife practical.
This fact, as well as the fact shark teeth can inflict deep lacerations, probably explains why shark-tooth blades were restricted to weapons for conflict and ritual activities in the present and recent past.

Shark-tooth blades in recent times
Numerous societies across the globe have integrated shark teeth into their material culture. In particular, peoples living on coastlines (and actively fishing for sharks) are more likely to incorporate greater numbers of teeth into a wider range of tools.
Shark teeth are widely used to edge deadly combat weapons or powerful ritual blades in the Pacific. Left: a knife from Kiribati; centre and right: weapons from Hawai'i. The Trustees of The British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA
Observations of present-day communities indicate that, when not used to adorn the human body, shark teeth were almost universally used to create blades for conflict or ritual – including ritualised combat.
For example, a fighting knife found throughout north Queensland has a single long blade made from approximately 15 shark teeth placed one after the other down a hardwood shaft shaped like an oval, and is used to strike the flank or buttocks of an adversary.
Weapons, including lances, knives and clubs armed with shark teeth are known from mainland New Guinea and Micronesia, while lances form part of the mourning costume in Tahiti.
Farther east, the peoples of Kiribati are renowned for their shark-tooth daggers, swords, spears and lances, which are recorded as having been used in highly ritualised and often fatal conflicts.
Shark teeth found in Maya and Mexican archaeological contexts are widely thought to have been used for ritualised bloodletting, and shark teeth are known to have been used as tattooing blades in Tonga, Aotearoa New Zealand, and Kiribati.
In Hawai‘i, so-called “shark-tooth cutters” were used as concealed weapons and for “cutting up dead chiefs and cleaning their bones preparatory to the customary burials”.

Other shark tooth archaeological finds
Almost all shark-tooth artefacts recovered globally have been identified as adornments, or interpreted as such.
Indeed, modified shark teeth have been recovered from older contexts. A solitary tiger shark tooth with a single perforation from Buang Merabak (New Ireland, Papua New Guinea) is dated to around 39,500–28,000 years ago. Eleven teeth with single perforations from Kilu (Buka Island, Papua New Guinea) are dated to around 9,000–5,000 years ago. And an unspecified number of teeth from Garivaldino (Brazil) is dated to around 9,400–7,200 years ago.
However, in each of these cases the teeth were likely personal ornaments, not weapons.
Our newly described Indonesian shark tooth artefacts, with their combination of modifications and microscopic traces, instead indicate they were not only attached to knives, but very likely linked to ritual or conflict.
Whether they cut human or animal flesh, these shark teeth from Sulawesi could provide the first evidence that a distinctive class of weaponry in the Asia-Pacific region has been around much longer than we thought.","Bringing a shark to a knife fight: 7,000-year-old shark-tooth knives discovered in Indonesia",science + tech
"Forty-one states and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits against Meta on Oct. 24, 2023, alleging that the company intentionally designed Facebook and Instagram with features that harm teens and young users.
Meta officials had internal research in March 2020 showing that Instagram – the social media platform most used by adolescents after TikTok – is harmful to teen girls’ body image and well-being. But the company swept those findings under the rug to continue conducting business as usual, according to a Sept. 14, 2021, Wall Street Journal report. The report was based on documents provided by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.
Meta’s record of pursuing profits regardless of documented harm has sparked comparisons to Big Tobacco, which knew in the 1950s that its products were carcinogenic but publicly denied it into the 21st century. Those of us who study social media use by teens didn’t need a suppressed internal research study to know that Instagram can harm teens. Plenty of peer-reviewed research papers show the same thing.
Understanding the impact of social media on teens is important because almost all teens go online daily. A Pew Research Center poll shows that 77% of teens report they use social media daily.
Teens are more likely to log on to Instagram than any other social media site except TikTok. It is a ubiquitous part of adolescent life. Yet studies consistently show that the more often teens use Instagram, the worse their overall well-being, self-esteem, life satisfaction, mood and body image. One study found that the more that college students used Instagram on any given day, the worse their mood and life satisfaction were that day.
Meta has taken steps to make Instagram less harmful to teens, but experts say the changes are not enough.
Unhealthy comparisons
But Instagram isn’t problematic simply because it is popular. There are two key features of Instagram that seem to make it particularly risky. First, it allows users to follow both celebrities and peers, both of whom can present a manipulated, filtered picture of an unrealistic body along with a highly curated impression of a perfect life.
While all social media allows users to be selective in what they show the world, Instagram is notorious for its photo editing and filtering capabilities. Plus, the platform is popular among celebrities, models and influencers. Facebook has been relegated to the uncool soccer moms and grandparents. For teens, this seamless integration of celebrities and retouched versions of real-life peers presents a ripe environment for upward social comparison, or comparing yourself to someone who is “better” in some respect.
People, as a general rule, look to others to know how to fit in and judge their own lives. Teens are especially vulnerable to these social comparisons. Just about everyone can remember worrying about fitting in in high school. Instagram exacerbates that worry. It is hard enough to compare yourself to a supermodel who looks fantastic (albeit filtered); it can be even worse when the filtered comparison is Natalie down the hall.
Negatively comparing themselves to others leads people to feel envious of others’ seemingly better lives and bodies. Recently, researchers even tried to combat this effect by reminding Instagram users that the posts were unrealistic.
It didn’t work. Negative comparisons, which were nearly impossible to stop, still led to envy and lowered self-esteem. Even in studies in which participants knew the photos they were shown on Instagram were retouched and reshaped, adolescent girls still felt worse about their bodies after viewing them. For girls who tend to make a lot of social comparisons, these effects are even worse.
Objectification and body image
Instagram is also risky for teens because its emphasis on pictures of the body leads users to focus on how their bodies look to others. My colleagues’ and my research shows that for teen girls – and increasingly teen boys – thinking about their own bodies as the object of a photo increases worrying thoughts about how they look to others, and that leads to feeling shame about their bodies. Just taking a selfie to be posted later makes them feel worse about how they look to others.
Being an object for others to view doesn’t help the “selfie generation” feel empowered and sure of themselves – it can do exactly the opposite. These are not insignificant health concerns, because body dissatisfaction during the teen years is a powerful and consistent predictor of later eating disorder symptoms.
Meta has acknowledged internally what researchers have been documenting for years: Instagram can be harmful to teens. Parents can help by repeatedly talking to their teens about the difference between appearance and reality, by encouraging their teens to interact with peers face-to-face, and to use their bodies in active ways instead of focusing on the selfie.
The big question will be how Meta handles these damaging results. History and the courts have been less than forgiving of the head-in-the-sand approach of Big Tobacco.

"The kola nut tree is grown for its seed. The tree is indigenous to west Africa, where it is widely cultivated. It’s now also found in Asia, South America and the Caribbean.
World production of kola nut was about 311,331 tonnes in 2021. Over 90% of the world’s kola nut is produced in west Africa, where Nigeria contributes 50%, Cameroon 27%, Côte d'Ivoire 16% and Ghana 8%.
The most popular species are Cola nitida (known in west Africa as gbànja in the Yòrùbá language; oji in Igbo; gworo in Hausa) and Cola acuminata (àbàtà, Yòrùbá).
Kola nut contains natural chemicals that act as a stimulant when eaten. It is part of the culture and tradition of some Nigerians. For example, it is offered as a gesture of hospitality among the Igbo. It is used for divination and in ceremonies by the Yòrùbá. Hausa people chew it to reduce hunger.
Parts of the plant are widely used in folk medicine, to treat overweight, pains, cough, malaria, infertility, dysentery, typhoid fever, herpes, rheumatism, arthritis and various infections. It is rich in phytochemicals – compounds produced by plants.
The nuts are also used as flavouring agents and incorporated into energy drinks and pharmaceuticals.
Our research over the past 10 years has focused on other potential uses of kola. We have tested different parts of the tree – its seed, seed shell, pod and leaf – in our laboratory in Ogbomoso, western Nigeria.
Our experiments showed that, through biotechnology and nanotechnology, there are potential new uses in areas like agriculture and health.
Biotechnology and nanotechnology
Biotechnology uses living organisms to make different products. For instance, yeast is a living organism which is used to produce bread.
Nanotechnology makes and uses structures, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at the nanoscale. One nanometre is a billionth of a metre. It has applications in agriculture, industry, medicine, the environment and consumer products.
Our laboratory uses both technologies.
For example, we have used nanoparticles to improve the yield of citric acid by black mold in cashew apple juice medium. Our nanotechnology research group also made the first attempt to produce nanotextiles using cotton and silk in Nigeria. We used silver and silver-titanium oxide nanoparticles produced by locust beans’ wastewater to modify the fabric. Locust bean is a multipurpose tree legume found in Nigeria and some other parts of Africa.
Our experiments have shown, too, that nanoparticles produced using kola nut can be applied in agriculture, the environment and healthcare.
Applying technologies to kola nut
Since 2015, we have used the kola plant to produce different types of nanoparticles. These include silver nanoparticles synthesised by the pod, seed and seed shell, and alloy nanoparticles.
Other synthesised nanoparticles are titanium dioxide, titanium-silver alloy, calcium, and magnesium oxide.
Read more: How nanotechnology can revive Nigeria's textile industry
We found that the kola nut provided chemicals that catalysed the formation of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were active against disease-causing bacteria and fungi, prevented coagulation of blood and degraded some dyes. Some of them also promoted growth of vegetables and Moringa.
In a recent publication, we reviewed the ways that kola nut can be used to produce biofuel, dyes and animal feeds. Other uses are production of nanomaterials, enzymes, biofertilizer, activated carbon and pesticides. Their extracts also offer protection against corrosion of metals.
Kola nut for sustainable development
We have detailed the importance of kola nut in catalysis, renewable energy, adsorption technology, corrosion inhibition, feed technology, and nanobiotechnology. These products can be applied to achieve sustainable development goals – zero hunger, affordable and clean energy, clean water and sanitation, good health and wellbeing, and industry, innovation and infrastructure.
We argue in our latest paper that it’s possible to turn unused and waste materials from kola nut processing into new products using eco-friendly processes.
Nigeria generates an estimated 90,000 tonnes of waste pod and shell from kola nut processing annually. Our research shows that these wastes can be used to produce important products.
Read more: How Nigeria can turn its huge cashew waste into valuable citric acid
Our investigations have shown that kola nut holds a lot of potential. The waste from its processing is a “gold mine” that could be used to create wealth by producing valuable products. Nigeria’s cultivation of kola nut should be expanded for this purpose. New high yielding varieties are needed to increase productivity. This will create material resources that can be deployed in biotechnology, catalysis and nanotechnology to contribute to the nation’s economy.",Kola nut: from nanofertiliser to protecting metals from corrosion – our research finds new uses for the valuable plant,science + tech

This information warfare has real-world consequences. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests organised through social media have drawn tens of thousands of people onto the streets, despite anti-protest measures adopted in some countries.
The horrific events of the war, along with responses from across the world, underscore the dangers of diplomatic inaction. They also raise questions about the role digital activism plays in shaping the power dynamics that govern war and politics.
Irresponsible messaging fans the flames
In the Israel-Gaza war, Hamas is spreading propaganda on platforms including Telegram and X, while Israel’s broad propaganda efforts include paid ads showing images of brutal violence on X and YouTube.
Nor can traditional media be blindly considered a reliable source of facts. Conflict reporting often focuses on specific violent events while ignoring their context, and news outlets have also made misleading and unsubstantiated claims in their reporting.
At the same time, access for journalists and investigators is extremely limited and responsibility for events such as the deadly al-Ahli hospital blast is highly contested and requires more impartial verified evidence.
Real-world consequences
Violence has spread well beyond Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, many Palestinians have been killed in attacks by Israeli settlers and forces.
In the United States, a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death and his mother wounded in an Islamophobic, anti-Palestinian attack.
In France, a teacher was killed and three students wounded in an Islamist attack at a school, and the Louvre was evacuated after bomb threats. The country has enacted its highest state of security alert.
In the United Kingdom, Jewish schools have been closed in London and Jewish institutions across the country have reported a 400% spike in antisemitic incidents since the war began. In Berlin, violence broke out as petrol bombs were thrown at a synagogue in an antisemitic attack.
What is ‘digital activism’?
“Digital activism” can be thought of as any digitally enabled form of activism and political participation. For scholars, digital activism is a conceptual troublemaker that is considered broad, ambiguous and contested. But its function is especially significant in times of conflict and war.
So, does digital activism actually lead to change? What are its implications, and limitations?
Digital activism as a productive force
The impacts of digital activism can be varied. In the Black Lives Matter movement, digital activism was used to articulate counternarratives and reframe major controversies in ways that engendered social and political action.
In the Syrian refugee crisis, it helped galvanise the public into rapid action. It was also used to coordinate disaster response and financial assistance in the wake of the 2020 Beirut explosion.
Digital activism helped build collective networks of solidarity and resistance in social movements such as the 2011 Egyptian uprising and Occupy Wall Street. In the Russia–Ukraine war, it helped shape participation in conflict-related mobilisation.
And in the context of Israel and Palestine, research has shown digital activism can influence the opinions of both international and domestic audiences, which in turn directly affects events on the ground and the dynamics of conflict.
Citizens and public figures have taken to social media platforms to express outrage and solidarity, perform fact-checking, coordinate aid efforts and inject cultural and historical nuance into discussions.
Online accounts of events allow war to be studied using digital forensics. They may also become evidence in open-source investigations into human rights violations, such as those conducted by Bellingcat and Forensic Architecture.
Activists have also used platforms to counter state repression of information, helping them maintain political autonomy and control how they are represented. However, these platforms often also become sites of control and censorship.
Digital activism as a weapon
While digital activism can serve productive purposes, it can also have unintended and disastrous consequences. Digital activists on mainstream social media platforms must navigate a highly complex online landscape.
The battle to control the narrative of war in these spaces has become almost as intense as the physical acts that define war.
Digital rights groups monitoring regional social media activity say the censorship of pro-Palestinian voices is at a level not seen since the May 2021 Israel-Palestine conflict. Researchers say the level of hate speech, mis- and disinformation on social media is at unprecedented levels. However, it can’t be studied systematically because tools to assess the impact are not available for independent verification.
Read more: Social media platforms are complicit in censoring Palestinian voices
There’s no shortage of posts using dehumanising language and disinformation to delegitimise the suffering of Palestinians. People who rush to publish content without verifying it can end up doing harm.
How to engage responsibly
For those of us bearing witness to the events unfolding, there are ways we can act responsibly and humanely to maximise benefit and minimise harm.
1. Develop critical media literacy skills
Before you share something online, verify whether the information is substantiated. Seek out sources such as Reuters Fact Check, Fake Reporter or disinformation experts, and develop fact-checking skills through tools and resources.
2. Build your cultural literacy
The history of the Israel–Palestine conflict is complex and storied. Digital activism based on ahistorical and culturally illiterate perspectives is unhelpful.
Before you share a post, take responsibility to educate yourself and reflect on your biases and knowledge limitations. The roots of this conflict have to be understood within a specific cultural, colonial and imperial historic context which dates back to the signing of the Balfour Declaration in 1917.
3. Foster tolerance
Pluralism and healthy debate are essential for democracy. We should find ways to have difficult but respectful conversations with people who have different views to us. It is important to have a media diet that exposes you to different perspectives. Without tolerance, we can’t recognise and reinforce our collective humanity.
The Conversation is commissioning articles by academics across the world who are researching how society is being shaped by our digital interactions with each other. Read more here","In times of war, digital activism has power. Here’s how to engage responsibly",science + tech
"Dingoes are an iconic Australian wild animal, with close links to Australia’s First Peoples throughout the mainland. Yet the origins and history of these animals are shrouded in obscurity.
The question of whether dingoes are a truly wild or formerly domestic animal that has become feral has eluded a clear answer or consensus amongst scientists for well over a century.
Published in PLOS One today, our new study of dingoes buried alongside First Nations people in ancient times has provided crucial clues to this mystery. Our findings may help change the way we think about the connections between dingoes and people.
Living alongside people
When outsiders observed traditional First Peoples’ societies in the 19th and 20th centuries throughout mainland Australia, they noticed many took dingo pups from wild dens and raised them to keep as companions and for a variety of other purposes including as guards, hunting aids and living “blankets”.
However, these dingoes always returned to the bush to find a mate after reaching about a year of age, seemingly never to return. This is quite unlike our domestic dogs – they may wander, but ultimately tend to stay with their human families in the long term.
The fact most dingoes live without any reliance on people is one of the main reasons scientific opinion differs over whether dingoes should be thought of as domestic animals or not.

But is it possible different arrangements between dingoes and Australia’s First Peoples existed before traditional ways of life were disrupted by colonial violence, displacement and disease? Answers might be found in the bones of dingoes that lived with people and were buried after death.
There are historical accounts of funerary and burial rituals of deceased tamed dingoes. Skeletons of dingoes or dogs have been found alongside First Peoples’ burials in many areas of Australia from Arnhem Land to the Murray-Darling basin, but to date there’s been no comprehensive study of this important cultural practice.
In a search of historical records and findings of dingo burials, we found they were concentrated in the Murray-Darling Basin and on the southern coastlines of New South Wales and Victoria. A secondary, more recent cluster was located in north-western Australia.

Buried alongside people
Historical records and archaeological evidence both show that when dingoes were buried, it was invariably in the manner in which people were buried in the same region. Often, dingoes were buried alongside people.
The act of burial implies a degree of care and belonging to a community. Some archaeologists argue animal burial is a fundamental sign of domestication. But by examining the skeletons of buried dingoes we can further investigate the life histories of these important animals.
The archaeological site of Curracurrang, a rock shelter in the Royal National Park just south of Sydney, was excavated in the 1960s. The excavations found First People were buried there over many centuries.
But our new primary investigations of previously unstudied animal bones reveal the site also contained the skeletons of several dingoes. Radiocarbon dates taken from their bones found the earliest of these were buried around 2,300–2,000 years ago. Dingo burials continued here until the colonial era.

Some of the dingoes were adults, at least six to eight years old – well past the age at which they’d be expected to return to the wild to breed. They had severely worn teeth, indicating a diet heavy in large bones, likely from the scraps of human meals.
In addition, one dingo showed signs of suffering from an aggressive, mobility-restricting form of cancer in the last weeks of its life. It was likely looked after by people during its decline.
Several other burials were pups, less than a month or two in age. Since dingoes of breeding age were also found at Curracurrang, it is entirely probable some of these pups were born there but did not survive long, and were buried soon after. These individuals are the first known evidence of dingo pup burial in Australia.

A previously obscured relationship
Dingo burials reveal aspects of the relationship between Australia’s First Peoples and their dingo companions which had been, until now, obscured.
At Curracurrang, tame dingoes lived to advanced ages alongside people. They ate the same foods and possibly even bore litters of pups within human camps. While traditional views of domestication involve dramatic transformations in appearance and human control over animal reproduction, newer perspectives focus on long-lasting relationships between people and animals.
The evidence from Curracurrang suggests some dingoes, at least in certain settings, were domesticated in ancient times. This doesn’t mean all dingoes were domesticated, nor does it conclusively indicate they originate from domestic dogs.
Most dingoes were, and still are, wild animals with various adaptations to life independent of people in Australian environments.
However, the new findings do mark an important development in our understanding of the deep antiquity and closeness of the connection between Australia’s First Peoples and their native dogs. It attests to long-lasting relationships beyond the transient, temporary associations recorded during the colonial era.

How many hours does the average American spend on devices each year? – Maxwell P., age 10
Think about your favorite devices – your smartphone, laptop, tablet, computer or console – the things you use to play cool games, watch hilarious videos and connect and chat with friends.
Many young people spend a lot of free time looking at them. Turns out that teens spend an average of 8½ hours on screens per day, and tweens – that’s ages 8 to 12 – are not far behind, at 5½ hours daily.
Keep in mind those numbers are for only social media, gaming and texting. They do not include the time that kids used screens for schoolwork or homework.
What’s more, much of the time taken up by social media and texting is apparently not even enjoyable, much less productive. A 2017 study of teens ages 13 to 18 suggests they spend most of those hours on the phone in their bedroom, alone and distressed.
These lonely feelings correlate with the rise in the use of digital media. In 2022, 95% of teens had smartphones compared with only 23% in 2011. And 46% of today’s teens say they use the internet almost constantly, compared with 24% of teenagers who said the same in 2014 and 2015.
Our team of psychiatrists who treat young people with digital addiction have many patients who spend over 40 hours per week on screens – and some, up to 80 hours.
Think about it: If you spend “just” an average of 50 hours per week on devices from ages 13 to 18 – the total time you will spend on screens equates to more than 12 years of school!
The U.S. surgeon general says too much screen time can increase anxiety and depression in teens and tweens.
Find the right balance
All this is not to say that everything about devices is bad. In this digital age, people embark on exciting journeys through the screens of their devices. Sometimes, screens are the windows to a magical adventure.
But too much screen time can lead to problems. As human beings, we function best when we’re in a state of balance. That happens when we eat well, exercise regularly and get enough sleep.
But spending too much time using digital devices can cause changes in the way you think and behave. Many teens and tweens developed the “fear of missing out” – known as FOMO. And one study shows some people develop nomophobia, which is the fear of being without your phone, or feeling anxious when you can’t use it.
Moreover, digital addiction in high school may predict serious depression, anxiety and sleep disruption in college.
Rates of depression and anxiety are skyrocketing among college students. The fear of missing out is pervasive, resulting in sleep disruption; too many college students sleep with smartphones turned on and near their bed – and wake up to respond to texts and notifications during the night. Sleep disruption itself is a core symptom of both depression and anxiety.
How to avoid device addiction
A 2016 poll indicated that half of teens felt they were addicted to their mobile devices.
Getting hooked on screens means missing out on healthy activities. To achieve a better balance, some experts recommend the following: Turn off all screens during family meals and outings. Don’t complain when your parents use parental controls. And turn off all the screens in your bedroom 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime – this step will improve sleep.
You may be a “screen addict” if you:
Feel uneasy or grumpy when you can’t use your device.
Don’t take breaks while spending hours on your device.
Ignore other fun activities you enjoy, like going outside or reading a book.
Have trouble sleeping, or falling asleep, because your screen time is too close to bedtime.
Experience eye, lower back and neck strain.
Struggle with weight gain or obesity because you’re inactive.
Have difficulty with real-life, face-to-face social interactions.
If you notice these signs, do not dismiss them. But also realize you’re not alone and help is out there. You can find balance again.
A kid breaks his addiction to gaming and social media.
A healthy approach
Exercise – riding a bike, playing sports, lifting weights or going for a jog or walk – keeps your brain healthy and protects it against depression and anxiety, as well as limiting your screen time.
Another way to be happier and healthier is to spend time with people – face to face, not via a screen. Seeing people live and in person is the best way to bond with others, and it may be even better for life span than exercise.
Creative hobbies are good, too. Cooking, playing an instrument, dancing, any arts and crafts, and thousands of other fun things make people happier and more creative. What’s more, hobbies make you well rounded and more attractive to others – which leads to more face-to-face interactions.
It’s also critical for parents to practice healthy screen habits. But about one-third of adults say they use screens “constantly.” This is not exactly a great example for kids; when adults take responsibility to minimize their own screen time, the whole family gets better.
Our research team used magnetic resonance imaging, also known as MRI, to scan the brains of teens who had digital addiction. We found impairment in the brain’s decision-making, processing and reward centers. But after a digital fast – meaning the addicted teens unplugged for two weeks – those brain abnormalities reversed, and the damage was undone.
Our findings also showed that kids with a desire to overcome digital addiction did better with a digital fast than those who were less willing or who denied their addiction.
A balanced lifestyle in the digital age is all about finding joy in screenless activities – being active, connecting with others and exploring your offline interests.

"The introduction of herding – a way of life which centres on keeping herds of mobile domesticated animals – significantly changed Africa’s genetic, economic, social and cultural landscapes during the last 10,000 years. Unlike other parts of the world, mobile herding spread throughout the continent thousands of years before farming and did not replace foraging in many places. This gave rise to complex mosaics of foragers and food producers across sub-Saharan Africa.
Once herding reached southern Africa during the early first millennium AD, it spread rapidly throughout the region, in part because of presumed local adoption of sheep by diverse groups of foragers. Since these foragers and herders left similar types of artefacts it is difficult to pinpoint who was herding in the archaeological record, their dietary choices, and how this way of life spread.
Traditional archaeological data alone – such as the types of animal bones present at sites – can’t always help. So, researchers need to combine multiple lines of evidence from both traditional and biomolecular archaeology, which involves studying ancient lipids (fats) and proteins.
I am an anthropological archaeologist whose research focuses on understanding how herders thrived in the Namaqualand coastal desert of South Africa over the last 2,000 years.
Recently I was part of a research team that wanted to better understand how ancient herders in Namaqualand incorporated sheep into their diet. We analysed the residues of past meals preserved in archaeological pottery. By analysing lipids entrapped in ancient pottery we found evidence for dairy fats.
This may seem, at first glance, to be merely historical curiosity with no current applications. But in reality, conducting this research now – while herding is still a viable economic activity in Namaqualand – can contribute to the broader discussion about climate resilient landscape use. Herding initially spread to Namaqualand amid environmental, economic and social change. Similar forces threaten the practice’s future. Understanding how ancient herders managed their herds in an unpredictable environment may offer insights for altering or refining current practices.
Studying the pots
Namaqualand, which covers around 50,000km², is located in the westernmost part of South Africa’s Northern Cape province.
Map of Southern Africa (inset) with Namaqualand enclosed in the darker grey area with approximate location of the archaeological sites and the town of Springbok marked.
It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Kamiesberg Mountains about 100km to the east, the Oliphants River to the south and the Orange River to the north. This semi-arid desert has an average annual rainfall of 150mm; more than 66% of that falls in the winter months. The largest town in the region is Springbok, with a population of just under 13,000.
There generally aren’t many livestock bones present at archaeological sites in the region. This is because herders were highly mobile, with small herds, and didn’t regularly consume their sheep.
However, there is an archaeological resource that exists in abundance: pottery sherds. These contain microscopic traces of the ancient meals cooked in them. Analysing these pottery-bound lipids using a method called organic residue analysis allows researchers to identify ruminant (for example sheep, cow, antelope), non-ruminant (for example seal, shellfish, fish), and ruminant dairy fats that were cooked in the pots. Finding dairy fats in pottery provides evidence for livestock when their bones are absent or unidentifiable at archaeological sites.
Read more: Chemical traces in ancient West African pots show a diet rich in plants
We analysed pottery from four archaeological sites in the region dated to between AD 137 and AD 1643 to help unravel the dietary choices of ancient herders and foragers in Namaqualand.
The two inland sites located along the Orange River contained the remains of domesticated animals and pottery. The two coastal sites did not contain domesticate remains but did contain pottery, generally regarded as a proxy for herders.
We found that the people using these pots ate a variety of foodstuff including ruminant and non-ruminant animal fats. We also found the first direct evidence for people processing milk in South African pottery.
These findings suggest that low-intensity herders living in Namaqualand during the period we studied didn’t rely solely on their domesticated animals for all or even most of their daily dietary needs. Instead they had diverse diets and relied on a range of species for daily subsistence.
Looking ahead
Our next step is to characterise the ceramic-bound proteins preserved in the pottery. Organic residue analysis is a powerful tool. But it can only separate lipids into broad categories (dairy, ruminant, non-ruminant). Ceramic-bound proteins, meanwhile, are similar to DNA in that they encode fundamental genetic information that is key to identifying species. This species-level data is vital since early food producer sites consist of wild and domestic species that look similar.
Though this research focuses on the distant past, it has applications today, too.
Read more: Livestock are threatened by predators – but old-fashioned shepherding may be an effective solution
In Namaqualand, herding remains an important livelihood for many: 60% of households participate in some form of daily herding activity. Globally, many herders face serious water, food, and pasture scarcity. Herders in Namaqualand are being exposed to extreme temperatures and often have severely limited access to water and pasture.
So, this more targeted type of research on the resource use and subsistence decisions of archaeological herders who thrived in an unpredictable environment is important and timely.",Ancient pots hold clues about how diverse diets helped herders thrive in southern Africa,science + tech
"Picture your typical human evolution museum display. You walk into a dimly lit space with glass boxes on white plinths or roped off areas. There are lots and lots of bones. Maybe a bit of history on how those bones were collected, and pictures of the famous people – usually men – who collected them. Often there are reconstructions of what these human ancestors might have looked like: dark-skinned and hairless ape-people, walking, mostly naked, holding stone tools, or even being hunted.
But where are you? How does such an exhibit show you who you are and how you came to be? We don’t think it does. So, in 2018 we were among a group of human evolution researchers who decided it was time to do things differently. The result is Humanity, a new human evolution exhibit that opened in September 2023 at Iziko South African Museum in Cape Town.
The exhibit offers a close look at the problematic history of palaeoanthropology; it also attempts to decolonise the story of human origins. To do so, it looks at how human evolution has been portrayed in the past, in ways that reinforce western biases and alienate and dehumanise living Africans. Then it works to remove those biases and make our understanding of human evolution scientifically accurate, broadly relevant and inclusive.
This is part of a broader reckoning happening in museum practice globally. Many institutions are reconsidering their collections and their roles as participants in colonial practice, including theft of artefacts and bodies. It is essential to consider how museums continue to alienate precisely the people who are owed reparations.
We learned an enormous amount while developing this exhibit, which is now a permanent fixture at the museum. Our hope is that these four central lessons could help other institutions locally and internationally to reconsider how they portray human evolution – and to understand why it matters.
A learning process
1. Make the co-creation process as inclusive as possible:
The Humanity exhibit was created through a collaborative process involving curators, researchers, collections managers, designers, conservators, educators, artists, heritage practitioners, community members, public participants, procurement specialists, service providers and administrators.
In this process, our plans changed often, when a diversity of lenses showed us where content and design missed the mark. The product is radically different from what we thought we would create. It is richer for that.
2. Lose the “great white explorer” narrative:
The history of human evolution is traditionally told as a story of white male exploration and discovery. South Africans learn in school and through the media about Raymond Dart, Robert Broom, Phillip Tobias, Lee Berger and other mostly foreign, English-speaking white men who are associated with important fossil discoveries in the country.
In contrast, we centred the exhibit’s story on the diversity of people in South Africa and how that diversity came to be.
This was done through portraiture, genetic testing and interviews about cultural identity to explore, through individuals, what makes them “them”. Interviewees spoke in the South African languages of their choice. This exploration of our collective humanity was used as an inroad for understanding how evolution has worked to shape us into what we are today.
Part of the exhibit focuses on the fact that the DNA of any two people is 99.9% identical. Becky Ackermann, Author provided (no reuse)
3. Own the problematic past:
Early South African palaeoanthropologists didn’t only find fossils: they also often engaged in colonial, racist science, studying and measuring living people as models for our “primitive” ancestors.
Read more: Archaeology is changing, slowly. But it's still too tied up in colonial practices
Even the iconography of human evolution has racist, colonial overtones. A Google Image search for “human evolution” will turn up a trove of images depicting evolution as a line of hominins transitioning from more ape-like to more human-like. Often the earlier ones are more hunched, hairier, and darker, suggesting a link between black bodies and primitiveness, while the end product is a striding white man.
We put in place a number of interventions to deal with this legacy. The exhibit openly discusses race and racism, as well as the history of palaeoanthropology and institutions like Iziko Museum in propping up racist science. This is crucial because, although racial categories are meaningless biologically, they have had adverse social effects.
The theme of human connection is threaded through the whole exhibit. This shows how human evolution is not linear, but rather a braided stream – a view consistent with cutting-edge science. It also shows how the origin of our species is pan-African, and includes contributions from beyond Africa, and how this has made humanity more variable and more resilient.
4. Break the glass boxes:
Probably the biggest surprise as we developed this exhibit, at least for those of us raised going to museums, was how alienating museums actually are to most people.
Museums are a western notion. Putting heritage objects behind glass and on pedestals in sterile spaces is not only alienating, it can be downright offensive. The Humanity exhibit does not fit traditional museum aesthetics.
The exhibit highlights the fact that human evolution is not linear. Robyn Walker, Author provided (no reuse)
Instead, visitors are drawn into a welcoming space enveloped in a reed structure that resembles a giant basket, or a hut, staring up at the African sky. A wall of 100 handaxes is there to be touched, as are some important fossil casts. Gone are the scientific illustrations and realistically painted past landscapes. Instead, stories are communicated using art that is familiar to everyone – photographs, videos, animations, comic strips and graffiti.
Everyone’s story
The story of humanity is everyone’s story. A story of migration and mixing, and adapting to new contexts. It is a story of the connection of people along the long braided stream of our shared origins. It is important that we tell it that way.",Evolution revolution: how a Cape Town museum exhibit is rewriting the story of humankind,science + tech
"How much can the written records of ancient civilisations tell us about the animals they lived alongside? Our latest research, based on the venomous snakes described in an ancient Egyptian papyrus, suggests more than you might think. A much more diverse range of snakes than we’d imagined lived in the land of the pharaohs – which also explains why these Egyptian authors were so preoccupied with treating snakebites!
Like cave paintings, texts from early in recorded history often describe wild animals the writers knew. They can provide some remarkable details, but identifying the species involved can still be hard. For instance, the ancient Egyptian document called the Brooklyn Papyrus, dating back to around 660-330BC but likely a copy of a much older document, lists different kinds of snake known at the time, the effects of their bites, and their treatment.
As well as the symptoms of the bite, the papyrus also describes the deity associated with the snake, or whose intervention might save the patient. The bite of the “great snake of Apophis” (a god who took the form of a snake), for example, was described as causing rapid death. Readers were also warned that this snake had not the usual two fangs but four, still a rare feature for a snake today.
The venomous snakes described in the Brooklyn Papyrus are diverse: 37 species are listed, of which the descriptions for 13 have been lost. Today, the area of ancient Egypt is home to far fewer species. This has led to much speculation among researchers as to which species are being described.
The four-fanged snake
For the great snake of Apophis, no reasonable contender currently lives within ancient Egypt’s borders. Like most of the venomous snakes that cause the majority of the world’s snakebite deaths, the vipers and cobras now found in Egypt have just two fangs, one in each upper jaw bone. In snakes, the jaw bones on the two sides are separated and move independently, unlike in mammals.
The boomslang (Dispholidus typus) is now restricted to sub-Saharan savannas. W. Wüster
The nearest modern snake that often has four fangs is the boomslang (Disopholidus typus) from the sub-Saharan African savannas, now only found more than 400 miles (650km) south of present-day Egypt. Its venom can make the victim bleed from every orifice and cause a lethal brain haemorrhage. Could the snake of Apophis be an early, detailed description of a boomslang? And if so, how did the ancient Egyptians encounter a snake that now lives so far south of their borders?
Representation of Apep (Apophis) in Ancient Egyptian wall painting. Note resemblance to boomslang (above).
To find out, our masters student Elysha McBride used a statistical model called climate niche modelling to explore how the ranges of various African and Levantine (eastern Mediterranean) snakes have changed through time.
Niche modelling reconstructs the conditions in which a species lives, and identifies parts of the planet that offer similar conditions. Once the model has been taught to recognise places that are suitable today, we can add in maps of past climate conditions. It then produces a map showing all the places where that species might have been able to live in the past.
On the trail of ancient snakes
Our study shows the much more humid climates of early ancient Egypt would have supported many snakes that don’t live there today. We focused on ten species from the African tropics, the Maghreb region of north Africa and the Middle East that might match the papyrus’s descriptions. These include some of Africa’s most notorious venomous snakes such as the black mamba, puff adder and boomslang.
We found that nine of our ten species could probably once have lived in ancient Egypt. Many could have occupied the southern and southeastern parts of the country as it then was – modern northern Sudan and the Red Sea coast. Others might have lived in the fertile, vegetated Nile valley or along the northern coast. For instance, boomslangs might have lived along the Red Sea coast in places that 4,000 years ago would have been part of Egypt.
Similarly, one entry of the Brooklyn Papyrus describes a snake “patterned like a quail” that “hisses like a goldsmith’s bellows”. The puff adder (Bitis arietans) would fit this description, but currently lives only south of Khartoum in Sudan and in northern Eritrea. Again, our models suggest that this species’ range would once have extended much further north.

Since the period we modelled, a lot has changed. Drying of the climate and desertification had set in about 4,200 years ago, but perhaps not uniformly. In the Nile valley and along the coast, for instance, farming and irrigation might have slowed the drying and allowed many species to persist into historical times. This implies that many more venomous snakes we only know from elsewhere might have been in Egypt at the time of the pharaohs.
Our study shows how enlightening it can be when we combine ancient texts with modern technology. Even a fanciful or imprecise ancient description can be highly informative. Modelling modern species’ ancient ranges can teach us a lot about how our ancestors’ ecosystems changed as a result of environmental change. We can use this information to understand the impact of their interactions with the wildlife around them.","Ancient Egypt had far more venomous snakes than the country today, according to our new study of a scroll",science + tech
"Seeing elephants in the wild is a timelessly awe-inspiring experience. There are only three living species today: the African savannah elephant, African forest elephant, and Asian elephant.
They are the remnants of a once prosperous lineage of megaherbivores called proboscideans, whose evolutionary epic spanned 60 million years and some 200 species. The African continent was the centre stage of this story.
But, until now, it hasn’t been clear how natural selection favoured modern elephants as the only tiny surviving branch of proboscideans.
A new study by palaeontologists Juha Saarinen and Adrian Lister provides the answers. Lister supervised my PhD, which focused on evolutionary relationships of fossil elephants. Saarinen hosts my current postdoctoral position at the University of Helsinki, as we’re pursuing research stemming from these findings.
They focused on the emergence of elephants’ highly specialised, multi-plated cheek teeth from the primitive dentition of earlier proboscideans. Their conclusions demonstrate that behavioural adjustments in response to changing environments can produce sustained transformative trends in animals’ adaptive structures over tens of millions of years.
Teething problems
Modern elephants’ diets consist of copious amounts of tough, fibrous, often low-quality fodder. They’re able to eat this way because of their teeth: six massive grinding teeth per jaw half that erupt and expend sequentially in a horizontal “queue” throughout the animal’s life, each successively larger than the previous tooth. The adult molars are as big as bricks.
Enamel ridges that align longitudinally along the tooth shear up the vegetation like a cheese grater as the jaws move. These teeth also have high crowns that continuously erupt into position as the older chewing surface wears away, like lead pushing up in a mechanical pencil. This helps elephants deal with continuous tooth attrition from chewing.
The fossil record shows that, 20 million years ago, proboscidean teeth looked completely different. These teeth had rounded cusps aligned in pairs, versatile for chewing up a wide range of plant food in the primeval forests and thickets they inhabited. But they were ill-suited for tackling large quantities of tough, abrasive vegetation.
Scientists theorised that two major factors drove the evolution of wear-resistant dental features seen in elephants today. One was the spread of grass that could tolerate a cooler, drier and more seasonal climate than the cosy forest homes ancestral proboscideans occupied. The second was that large herbivores ingested more adhesive dust in these new arid environments than they had before.
Both challenges arose within the past 20 million years. But it wasn’t clear exactly how these two factors drove adaptive changes in herbivore teeth. The theory also presented a chicken-and-egg paradox: which took off first, the evolving teeth or the altered habitats?
The evidence
Saarinen devised a simple quantitative method to solve this conundrum. It’s founded on a basic mechanical principle. The way grazers eat wears the teeth flat, while browsers’ teeth have a more “edged” chewing surface. That means grazing elephants should develop angles of wear on their teeth that are wider than those of browsing elephants.
To test this idea, Saarinen first measured recent elephant teeth from Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park, which confirmed his initial postulation. He and Lister then turned to Africa’s wealth of geological and fossil records.
Saarinen’s tooth wear angle measurements illustrated on the fossil molars of (a) an extinct elephant from Tanzania, with multi-ridged chewing surface like that of modern elephants for shearing up vegetation; and (b) the ‘shovel-tusker’ gomphothere Protanancus from Maboko, western Kenya, with enamel rings from the wearing down of rounded cusps that grind down the food. Juha Saarinen, Author provided (no reuse)
Their tooth wear measurements from fossils revealed that, about 21 million years ago, the first increase in dietary uptake of grass was achieved by the primitive “gomphothere”-type proboscideans of Africa. Gomphotheres were the generalised ancestral stock from which modern elephants and their other extinct relatives evolved.

They also discovered that these gomphotheres grazed more as grass cover expanded across their habitats between 21 million and 6 million years ago, as indicated by plant fossil fragments from the sites where the gomphothere teeth were found. Yet this was achieved with little structural evolution in their teeth.
This was a boom period for African proboscidean diversity. Habitats containing three or four proboscidean species were common. Some species adopted grazing to minimise competition with neighbouring pachyderms that preferred softer fodder.
Before the appearance of modern elephants, their early relatives included several species that often shared their environment and adapted to feeding on different plants. This image depicts a landscape in Maboko, western Kenya about 15 million years ago, where a primitive deinothere (Prodeinotherium, on the left foreground) and a shovel-tusked gomphothere (Protanancus, behind Prodeinotherium) were feeding on leaves and branches from trees and shrubs, whereas a choerolophodont gomphothere Afrochoerodon (in the background) fed on grasses in open and grass-rich parts of the habitat. They shared their environment with other smaller herbivorous mammals such as the ancestors of today’s chevrotains (Dorcatherium, left foreground). Beth Zaiken, Author provided (no reuse)
Ultimate survivors
To scrutinise previously theorised links between climate, vegetation change and elephant evolution, Saarinen and Lister examined records from sediment cores drilled off Africa’s west and east coasts over previous decades. Those cores are essentially archives, capturing tens of millions of years of environmental changes on the continent. Arid periods are marked by dustier segments of the core.
Read more: Fossil tracks and trunk marks reveal signs of ancient elephants on South Africa's coast
Statistical testing of the data showed that the African environment began to get drastically more arid between 7 million and 5 million years ago, and this drove a vast increase in the rate of dental evolution in the lineage that gave rise to mammoths and modern elephants, as well as promoting the further spread of grasslands.
Thus came proof that the high-crowned, multi-plated molars of elephants evolved primarily to withstand grit, rather than fibre, in their food. This new dental form provided such an advantage that, around 3.6 million years ago, early elephants had outcompeted the last African gomphotheres into extinction.
New research avenues
The zenith of this evolutionary ratchet was Palaeoloxodon. It was the largest elephant to evolve, standing over 4 metres tall at the shoulder and weighing 12–15 tonnes. With brick-sized molars packing up to 21 grating plates, Palaeoloxodon was the undisputed top megaherbivore of the African savannah between 1.5 million and around 130,000 years ago, in both its stature and feeding adaptations.

Yet, within the last million years of our story, when African savannahs became increasingly arid and seasonal just as they did for the previous 5 million years, these spectacular grazing specialists vanished. Why?
Upon discussing his findings, Saarinen and I converged on a hypothesis. Modern African elephants are half the size of their prehistoric cousins, with teeth less specialised towards a grass-dominated diet. This may be key for elephants to tolerate the arid shrublands of today’s Africa, which have little grass cover to support such enormous grass-dependent vegetarians as Palaeoloxodon.
We’re examining this as part of our current research, hoping to decipher whether the encroachment of grasslands by shrubby arid zones drove the extinction of Palaeoloxodon and other spectacular giant herbivores in Africa over the past million years. The story we ultimately tell may serve as a stark warning for how climate change will further decimate African biodiversity, if it’s left unchecked.",Elephant teeth: how they evolved to cope with climate change-driven dietary shifts,science + tech
"For thousands of years, medicines have been developed from natural sources – mostly from plants. In recent decades, though, drug hunters have been looking at the immense diversity of marine organisms as potential sources of new medicines.
Marine sponges have garnered particular attention. They are considered champion producers of molecules (known as “natural products”). They produce these because they use toxic compounds to deter predators, communicate with their neighbours, or prevent algae and bacteria from growing on them.
Marine sponges are a remarkably diverse group of animals, with over 9,000 species. They come in a wide array of shapes, sizes and colours, ranging from small, inconspicuous forms to large and vibrant reef-building varieties. They look like a sedentary blob of porous tissue on the seafloor, which gives them their name.
As some of the most primitive animals on the planet, they lack complex organs and tissues. Without physical and mechanical features to flee (fins, legs), attack (spines), and protect themselves (shells), they have evolved to survive by producing chemical compounds. Some of these compounds have been found to possess valuable properties against cancer and microbial infections.
Interest in these properties started in the early 1950s after the discovery of two new natural products from the Caribbean sponge species Tectitethya crypta. The products were later approved for use as drugs against leukemia and HIV.
Discoveries like this have raised substantial interest in therapeutic applications of sponge-derived chemicals.
This is where my home country, Mauritius, has huge potential. Mauritius has an array of sponge species, offering the opportunity to discover bioactive agents.
I obtained my PhD in the field of applied marine biochemistry at the University of Mauritius. As part of my studies I worked with my research supervisors Ranjeet Bhagooli, Theeshan Bahorun, Vidushi Neergheen and late Alexander Kagansky to study the anticancer potential of the sponge Neopetrosia exigua from Mauritius waters.
We have just published a paper which shows, for the first time, that chemicals produced by N. exigua have the capacity to selectively kill liver cancer cells, with minimal harm to normal cells. Based on our findings about its pharmacological properties we suggest that the Mauritian sponge N. exigua has potential to be developed into a less toxic therapeutic candidate against liver cancer.
Our study is the first stage of the biodiscovery process. There are numerous steps which can take around 15 to 20 years from discovery of active compounds to use as medicines in humans.
Studying how a sponge kills cancer cells
Before our study, Neopetrosia species were already known to be a rich source of bioactive novel compounds, yet studies showing how they killed cancer cells were limited.
Neopetrosia exigua. Ranjeet Bhagooli
For our study, the first step was to collect a sample of N. exigua sponge from the Mauritian coral reefs by snorkelling and scuba diving. What could be better for a passionate lover of the sea than to have one of the world’s most pristine marine ecosystems as her working environment?
Once we had our sample, the sponge was carefully processed in the laboratory to obtain different extracts containing distinct natural products. These extracts were tested at the University of Edinburgh for their toxic effects against a panel of human cancer cell lines. Cell lines are groups of cells derived from living organisms that can keep growing and dividing in the lab. Scientists use them to learn about how cells work, test new medicines, and figure out how diseases function.
We also assessed the effects of the sponge extracts on non-cancerous cells to see how toxic they were to normal cells. This is particularly interesting since some anticancer treatments induce DNA damage indiscriminately, killing both normal and cancer cells. Cancer patients on those treatments may suffer from adverse side effects including nausea, anaemia, fatigue, hair loss and infections.
We found that one particular extract had the ability to selectively kill liver cancer cells at very low doses while displaying very low toxicity towards normal cells.
We also observed how the extract did this: N. exigua constituents activated various proteins that led to the breakdown of the liver cancer cells through a programmed cell death process called apoptosis. This process helps maintain the overall health and balance of an organism by getting rid of unwanted or potentially harmful cells. When apoptosis malfunctions, these harmful cells can continue to grow and divide, potentially forming a tumour.
Biodiscovery process
To validate the extract’s potential use, the next step will be to isolate and identify the natural products accountable for its anticancer activity using advanced analytical techniques such as chromatography and mass spectrometry.
This will set the stage for future evaluations in suitable experimental animal models to probe its efficacy and toxicity. If this step is successful, the tests proceed with humans in clinical trials.
Scientific data about the pharmacological properties of Mauritian marine organisms could create opportunities to promote marine biodiscovery research and sustainable use of the ocean resources in Mauritius. It will also add another reason to conserve the country’s marine biodiversity.
The marine sponge Neopetrosia exigua is highly distributed in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean (Caribbean Sea) and Pacific Ocean. However, its population density has significantly declined over the last few years in Mauritius due to a continued rise in ocean temperatures.",Mauritius sea sponge produces chemicals that can kill liver cancer cells – findings are a positive first step,science + tech
"To most people, complex technologies separate modern humans from their ancestors who lived in the Stone Age, thousands or hundreds of thousands of years ago. In today’s fast changing world, older technologies, even those from a few years ago, are often described dismissively as “Stone Age”.
Such terms serve to disconnect us from our ancient relatives, who were much more sophisticated than we sometimes think they were.
A team led by archaeologist Larry Barham at the University of Liverpool recently published robust and well dated evidence for the earliest known use of wood technology. The wooden structure, along with artefacts, date to 476,000 years ago and have been excavated from waterlogged deposits at Kalambo Falls, Zambia.
This archaeological site is famous for producing traces of human cultural development dating to hundreds of thousands of years ago.
The remarkably well preserved evidence found by Barham and colleagues include, among other things, a wedge (a type of wooden tool), a digging stick, a log cut with the help of tools and a branch with a notch cut into it.
But why, in the age of AI and robotics, should wood technology from nearly half a million years ago generate so much interest from both scientists and the public?
The evidence from Kalambo Falls demonstrates a remarkable ability by early hominins (ancient human relatives) to source wood and shape it with tools. They were able to produce, not only an assortment of other tools, but also sophisticated wooden structures. We don’t know exactly what species made the structure, but Homo heidelbergensis or a species similar to Homo naledi might be candidates, among others.
These results have far reaching implications for our understanding of how sustainable materials were used in the Early Stone Age. It also sheds light on the capabilities of early hominins.

From speculation to fact
Archaeology is the study of deep and recent history using the remains of things left by people who came before us. However, these histories are biased in favour of things that have either survived the passage of time or decayed but left traces.
Humans lived in the era known as the Stone Age for nearly 99% of human history. The Early Stone Age is considered the earliest and perhaps longest “technological age”, stretching from nearly four million years ago to 300,000 years ago.
We know more about stone tools during this early phase of human development, in part because inorganic materials such as rocks are nearly indestructible compared to those made of perishable materials like wood.
Indeed, wood is very scarce in deposits belonging to the Early Stone Age, requiring exceptional conditions of preservation to avoid decaying. It survives only in extremely dry environments such as deserts, or extremely wet conditions – as was the case at Kalambo Falls.
Our ancestors would have used wood to make tools and structures for shelter. Professor Larry Barham, University of Liverpool, Author provided (no reuse)
Given the scarcity of evidence, direct proof of the intentional use of wood from more than 400,000 years ago sharply transforms our understanding of the antiquity of wood as a technology – and how long hominins have been interacting with this versatile material. They used it to make tools, to build shelters, to obtain food and perhaps even for fuel as they went about their daily lives.
Although researchers had suspected that wood technology was widely used by early hominins, without hard, direct evidence, we could not accept that as fact. Archaeology is a discovery and evidence-based field of study –- seeing is believing. The Kalambo Falls discovery transformed speculation into fact, changing our understanding of the history of technology.
Benefiting the environment
However, part of the challenge comes from concepts of human history which could be described as progressivist or linear – that envisage history as an inevitable advance towards modernity through scientific and technological achievement.
In the past, some scientists considered the minds of early hominins to have been more limited compared to those of modern humans. They believed technology and culture improved in sophistication as human brain size increased, moving from a “simple” state to the complex, algorithm-dominated world we live in today.
Kalambo Falls is known for its extensive record of human settlement. Professor Geoff Duller, Aberystwyth University
Despite the fact that brain sizes have increased over time, and that technology has changed, it is possible that those who came before us had an impressive understanding of the materials around them and cared for their surroundings.
The intentionally-shaped wood construction from Kalambo Falls is an illustration of design, technology and creativity – using what in today’s world we would call a green technology.
Notions of “progress” are quite deeply embedded in culture. This can also be a proxy for the exceptionalism of modern humans (Homo sapiens) – the belief that there is something unique or exemplary about our species compared with earlier hominins. If we put these notions aside, we can recognise that so called “backward technologies” can greatly benefit the environment and the planet.
The fact that wood is perishable makes it a more sustainable material, unlike some modern construction materials that are nearly indestructible, and leave conspicuous ruins. Manufacturing these modern materials also emits greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
Of course, there are risks associated with using wood as a construction material, such as fire and decay. But in appropriate situations, we should continue our long tradition of building in wood. Perhaps the ancients were not so backward, but more progressive than us when it came to looking after the planet through sound decision making.
In summary, the Kalambo Falls evidence suggests that, at least sometimes, early hominins were able to take advantage of materials other than stone for their everyday needs, including tool-making and shelter. They might also have been able to use the resources in their environment for fuel and medicine.
However, we need more direct evidence, going back to the beginnings of the Stone Age to demonstrate how those who came before us used and worked with wood. More discoveries like this might even lead us to rename the mighty Stone Age as the Wood Age.",Discovery of half-a-million-year-old wooden structure shows we’re wrong to underestimate our ancient relatives,science + tech
"The 2023 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine will go to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for their discovery that modifying mRNA – a form of genetic material your body uses to produce proteins – could reduce unwanted inflammatory responses and allow it to be delivered into cells. While the impact of their findings may not have been apparent at the time of their breakthrough over a decade ago, their work paved the way for the development of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, as well as many other therapeutic applications currently in development. The 2023 Nobel Prize in physics likewise will go to a team of scientists who used lasers to clarify the behavior of electrons, and many prior Nobels have honored basic research.
We asked André O. Hudson, a biochemist and microbiologist at the Rochester Institute of Technology, to explain how basic research like that of this year’s Nobel Prize winners provides the foundations for science – even when its far-reaching effects won’t be felt until years later.
What is basic science?
Basic research, sometimes called fundamental research, is a type of investigation with the overarching goal of understanding natural phenomena like how cells work or how birds can fly. Scientists are asking the fundamental questions of how, why, when, where and if in order to bridge a gap in curiosity and understanding about the natural world.
Researchers sometimes conduct basic research with the hope of eventually developing a technology or drug based on that work. But what many scientists typically do in academia is ask fundamental questions with answers that may or may not ever lead to practical applications.
Humans, and the animal kingdom as a whole, are wired to be curious. Basic research scratches that itch.
What are some basic science discoveries that went on to have a big influence on medicine?
The 2023 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine acknowledges basic science work done in the early 2000s. Karikó and Weissman’s discovery about modifying mRNA to reduce the body’s inflammatory response to it allowed other researchers to leverage it to make improved vaccines.
Another example is the discovery of antibiotics, which was based on an unexpected observation. In the late 1920s, the microbiologist Alexander Fleming was growing a species of bacteria in his lab and found that his Petri dish was accidentally contaminated with the fungus Penicillium notatum. He noticed that wherever the fungus was growing, it impeded or inhibited the growth of the bacteria. He wondered why that was happening and subsequently went on to isolate penicillin, which was approved for medical use in the early 1940s.
This work fed into more questions that ushered in the age of antibiotics. The 1952 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to Selman Waksman for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic to treat tuberculosis.
Penicillin was discovered by accident.
Basic research often involves seeing something surprising, wanting to understand why and deciding to investigate further. Early discoveries start from a basic observation, asking the simple question of “How?” Only later are they parlayed into a medical technology that helps humanity.
Why does it take so long to get from curiosity-driven basic science to a new product or technology?
The mRNA modification discovery could be considered to be on a relatively fast track from basic science to application. Less than 15 years passed between Karikó and Weissman’s findings and the COVID-19 vaccines. The importance of their discovery came to the forefront with the pandemic and the millions of lives they saved.
Most basic research won’t reach the market until several decades after its initial publication in a science journal. One reason is because it depends on need. For example, orphan diseases that affect only a small number of people will get less attention and funding than conditions that are ubiquitous in a population, like cancer or diabetes. Companies don’t want to spend billions of dollars developing a drug that will only have a small return on their investment. Likewise, because the return on investment for basic research often isn’t clear, it can be a hard sell to support financially.
Another reason is cultural. Scientists are trained to chase after funding and support for their work wherever they can find it. But sometimes that’s not as easy as it seems.
A good example of this was when the human genome was first sequenced in the early 2000s. A lot of people thought that having access to the full sequence would lead to treatments and cures for many different diseases. But that has not been the case, because there are many nuances to translating basic research to the clinic. What works in a cell or an animal might not translate into people. There are many steps and layers in the process to get there.
Why is basic science important?
For me, the most critical reason is that basic research is how we train and mentor future scientists.
In an academic setting, telling students “Let’s go develop an mRNA vaccine” versus “How does mRNA work in the body” influences how they approach science. How do they design experiments? Do they start the study going forward or backward? Are they argumentative or cautious in how they present their findings?
There are many steps between translating findings in a lab to the clinic. Marco VDM/E+ via Getty Images
Almost every scientist is trained under a basic research umbrella of how to ask questions and go through the scientific method. You need to understand how, when and where mRNAs are modified before you can even begin to develop an mRNA vaccine. I believe the best way to inspire future scientists is to encourage them to expand on their curiosity in order to make a difference.
When I was writing my dissertation, I was relying on studies that were published in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Many of these studies are still cited in scientific articles today. When researchers share their work, though it may not be today or tomorrow, or 10 to 20 years from now, it will be of use to someone else in the future. You’ll make a future scientist’s job a little bit easier, and I believe that’s a great legacy to have.
What is a common misconception about basic science?
Because any immediate use for basic science can be very hard to see, it’s easy to think this kind of research is a waste of money or time. Why are scientists breeding mosquitoes in these labs? Or why are researchers studying migratory birds? The same argument has been made with astronomy. Why are we spending billions of dollars putting things into space? Why are we looking to the edge of the universe and studying stars when they are millions and billions of light years away? How does it affect us?
There is a need for more scientific literacy because not having it can make it difficult to understand why basic research is necessary to future breakthroughs that will have a major effect on society.
In the short term, the worth of basic research can be hard to see. But in the long term, history has shown that a lot of what we take for granted now, such as common medical equipment like X-rays, lasers and MRIs, came from basic things people discovered in the lab.
And it still goes down to the fundamental questions – we’re a species that seeks answers to things we don’t know. As long as curiosity is a part of humanity, we’re always going to be seeking answers.",Tenacious curiosity in the lab can lead to a Nobel Prize – mRNA research exemplifies the unpredictable value of basic scientific research,science + tech
"I am serving my ninth and final year in the Nobel Committee for Physics, which is an absolutely fascinating job – albeit hard. The best bit is hearing the reactions of the shocked laureates when they receive some of the biggest news of their lives over the phone.
Sometimes, I also give presentations about how Nobel laureates are selected. This can be in front of participants in a Nobel symposium, or in front of a high school class. And I have noticed that, while the topic tends to generate great interest, the process is poorly understood.
Read more: Nobel prize in physics awarded for work unveiling the secrets of electrons
Explaining how the laureates are selected isn’t entirely straightforward, however – there are strict rules of secrecy. I have to rely on material taken from the official website of the Nobel prize on the one hand, and case studies that are older than 50 years and therefore no longer secret on the other.
The Nobel Committee consists of about six to eight members appointed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The work to select a prize is divided into three parts. The first and very important part is the nominations. The committee sends out about 3,000 letters to researchers all over the world each September and October asking for nominations, with a deadline of January 31 the following year.
The list of nominees is regulated so that certain people are always consulted, including former Nobel laureates, professors of physics in the Nordic countries, and members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Then there is quite a large other group of people who are invited to make nominations but only for a few years at a time, so this part of the process is rotated regularly. Finally, many universities are asked to consult some faculty for their nomination, and once again the universities are rotated.
The second part involves expert reports. Based on the nominations, the committee identifies certain areas of physics where discoveries or inventions have occurred at a level that may make them eligible for an award.
The committee then solicits confidential reports from experts in these chosen areas, who are asked whether they regard these discoveries or inventions of sufficient importance to motivate a Nobel prize. If they do, they are also asked to identify the individuals they consider have made the most important contributions.
The final part is the work done by the committee. At the beginning of June, the committee meets and puts together a shortlist of the most interesting prize candidates. The discussions in the committee are always open, sharp, frank and sometimes emotional, but never hostile.
Albert Einstein did not win the Nobel prize for his theory of relativity. wikipedia, CC BY-SA
In the early 1920s, for example, there was enormous pressure to award Albert Einstein. But some members of the committee were sceptical about the theory of relativity. The compromise was to award Einstein for the explanation of a phenomenon called the photoelectric effect instead, which is exactly the effect this year’s laureates have investigated in great detail.
Amazingly, while the other successful theory of modern physics, quantum mechanics, has been richly awarded with Nobel prizes (1932/33, 1945, 1954, 2022), it took until 2020 for the theory of relativity to be awarded explicitly.
Final stages
During the summer, each committee member works on their own to prepare certain sections of the final prize report. During a retreat in August, the committee meets and finalises this report, with a recommendation to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. There are actually several meetings between committee members during the summer months, but contact by email and telephone is strictly forbidden.
The report, including a suggestion for a maximum of three laureates and a citation, is then sent to the academy. In September, the suggestion is discussed among the physics members of the academy. During a second September meeting, this group takes a vote on whether it supports the suggestion from the committee.
In October, on the same day the prize is announced, the academy meets again to make a final decision, which cannot be appealed. Once the decision has been taken, the laureates are contacted by telephone. Finally, the decision is announced at a press conference that is broadcast live on Swedish public TV and on the academy’s homepage.
The day after the announcement, a few of the committee members start helping with the poster that will be freely available to the public in connection with the Nobel lectures in December.
By now, the work on next year’s Nobel prize in Physics has already started – even before this year’s nominations were known. There are always expert reports that are discussed and solicited.

"Each October, the Nobel Prizes celebrate a handful of groundbreaking scientific achievements. And while many of the awarded discoveries revolutionize the field of science, some originate in unconventional places. For George de Hevesy, the 1943 Nobel Laureate in chemistry who discovered radioactive tracers, that place was a boarding house cafeteria in Manchester, U.K., in 1911.
Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy. Magnus Manske
De Hevesey had the sneaking suspicion that the staff of the boarding house cafeteria where he ate at every day was reusing leftovers from the dinner plates – each day’s soup seemed to contain all of the prior day’s ingredients. So he came up with a plan to test his theory.
At the time, de Hevesy was working with radioactive material. He sprinkled a small amount of radioactive material in his leftover meat. A few days later, he took an electroscope with him to the kitchen and measured the radioactivity in the prepared food.
His landlady, who was to blame for the recycled food, exclaimed “this is magic” when de Hevesy showed her his results, but really, it was just the first successful radioactive tracer experiment.
We are a team of chemists and physicists who work at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, located at Michigan State University. De Hevesy’s early research in the field has revolutionized the way that modern scientists like us use radioactive material, and it has led to a variety of scientific and medical advances.
The nuisance of lead
A year before conducting his recycled ingredients experiment, Hungary-born de Hevesy had traveled to the U.K. to start work with nuclear scientist Ernest Rutherford, who’d won a Nobel Prize just two years prior.
Rutherford was at the time working with a radioactive substance called radium D, a valuable byproduct of radium because of its long half-life (22 years). However, Rutherford couldn’t use his radium D sample, as it had large amounts of lead mixed in.
When de Hevesy arrived, Rutherford asked him to separate the radium D from the nuisance lead. The nuisance lead was made up of a combination of stable isotopes of lead (Pb). Each isotope had the same number of protons (82 for lead), but a different number of neutrons.
De Hevesy worked on separating the radium D from the natural lead using chemical separation techniques for almost two years, with no success. The reason for his failure was that, unknown to anyone at the time, radium D was actually a different form of lead – namely the radioactive isotope, or radioisotope Pb-210.
Nevertheless, de Hevesy’s failure led to an even bigger discovery. The creative scientist figured out that if he could not separate radium D from natural lead, he could use it as a tracer of lead.
Radioactive isotopes, like Pb-210, are unstable isotopes, which means that over time they will transform into a different element. During this transformation, called radioactive decay, they typically release particles or light, which can be detected as radioactivity.
Through radioactivity, an unstable isotope can turn from one element to another.
This radioactivity acts as a signature indicating the presence of the radioactive isotope. This critical property of radioisotopes allows them to be used as tracers.
Radium D as a tracer
A tracer is a substance that stands out in a crowd of similar material because it has unique qualities that make it easy to track.
For example, if you have a group of kindergartners going on a field trip and one of them is wearing a smartwatch, you can tell if the group went to the playground by tracking the GPS signal on the smartwatch. In de Hevesy’s case, the kindergartners were the lead atoms, the smart watch was radium D, and the GPS signal was the emitted radioactivity.
In the 1910s, the Vienna Institute of Radium Research had a larger collection of radium and its byproducts than any other institution. To continue his experiments with radium D, de Hevesy moved to Vienna in 1912.
He collaborated with Fritz Paneth, who had also attempted the impossible task of separating radium D from lead without success. The two scientists “spiked” samples of different chemical compounds with small amounts of a radioactive tracer. This way they could study chemical processes by tracking the movement of the radioactivity across different chemical reactions
De Hevesy continued his work studying chemical processes using different isotopic markers for many years. He even was the first to introduce nonradioactive tracers. One nonradioactive tracer he studied was a heavier isotope of hydrogen, called deuterium. Deuterium is 10,000 times less abundant than common hydrogen, but is roughly twice as heavy, which makes it easier to separate the two.
De Hevesy and his co-author used deuterium to track water in their bodies. In their investigations, they took turns ingesting samples and measuring the deuterium in their urine to study the elimination of water from the human body.
De Hevesy was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize in chemistry “for his work on the use of isotopes as tracers in the study of chemical processes.”
Radioactive tracers today
More than a century after de Hevesy’s experiments, many fields now routinely use radioactive tracers, from medicine to materials science and biology.
These tracers can monitor the progression of disease in medical procedures, the uptake of nutrients in plant biology, the age and flow of water in aquifers and the measurement of wear and corrosion of materials, among other applications. Radioisotopes allow researchers to follow the paths of nutrients and drugs in living systems without invasively cutting the tissue.

In modern research, scientists focus on producing new isotopes and on developing procedures to use radioactive tracers more efficiently. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, or FRIB, where the three of us work, has a program dedicated to the production and harvesting of unique radioisotopes. These radioisotopes are then used in medical and other applications.
FRIB produces radioactive beams for its basic science program. In the production process, a large number of unused isotopes are collected in a tank of water, where they can be later isolated and studied.

This was a challenging task considering there were 100 quadrillion times more water molecules than Zn-62 atoms. Zn-62 is an important radioactive tracer utilized to follow the metabolism of zinc in plants and in nuclear medicine.
Eighty years ago, de Hevesy managed to take a dead-end separation project and turn it into a discovery that created a new scientific field. Radioactive tracers have already changed human lives in so many ways.

"Plants are among the most intrepid explorers on Earth. Roughly 460 million years ago, the first plants started leaving lakes and rivers and appeared on land. At that time, the surface of Earth was mostly bare rock.
These pioneers had to overcome extraordinary challenges as they transitioned from their aquatic lifestyle. The crops we grow to feed ourselves now are struggling to adapt to the new extremes in our climate. But there is a way to help protect them: reawaken their ancient resilience.
All plants require 17 nutrients for life. Nitrogen, phosphate and potassium are the most important ones. A limited supply of any one of these stunts the plant’s growth.
So for millennia humans have domesticated crops to maximise production and to make sure plants had a sufficient supply of the nutrients they needed. Our ancestors collected and spread nightsoil (human faeces) on fields to fertilise them and battled over lands covered in nutrient-rich bird guano. More recently, humans have created a global trade in synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. The rise of human civilisation is intertwined with the use of plant nutrients in agriculture.
Many people think of plants as nice-looking greens. Essential for clean air, yes, but simple organisms. A step change in research is shaking up the way scientists think about plants: they are far more complex and more like us than you might imagine. This blossoming field of science is too delightful to do it justice in one or two stories. This article is part of a series, Plant Curious, exploring scientific studies that challenge the way you view plantlife.
These human-led practices may have boosted food production but they have also made crops lazy.
Ancient connections
Plants once had to adopt ingenious evolutionary solutions to survive on land. One way they evolved was to forge a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with soil fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal, which acted like primitive roots to help these early plants access nutrients from the land. In exchange, fungi received the energy plants harvested from photosynthesis.
Our farming practices have suppressed these symbiotic relationships.
Instead, we rely on chemical fertilisers to grow our food, which are responsible for both greenhouse gas emissions and agricultural pollution, and are largely unaffordable for smallholder farmers, who grow a third of the global food supply.
Far from being ancient history, however, I believe these symbiotic microbial relationships are still relevant to how we should or could be producing our food today.
Plants eventually evolved their own roots some 350-400 million years ago, but they continued tapping into this fungal relationship to help absorb nutrients from the land and soil.
Then, around 100 million years ago, some plants – what we now know as the legume family, including beans, peas, and lentils – developed a relationship with bacteria in the soil. The bacteria, called rhizobia, infect the roots of legumes and use an enzyme to break down nitrogen from the air into a substance accessible to the plant.

Wild plants still use these primeval associations to get these crucial nutrients. The traits plants need to switch on the symbiotic relationships lie mostly dormant or underused in the world’s food production systems.
Promising research
Scientists are working to understand how plants engage with these soil microorganisms, so we can reactivate them. Food production must increase to feed the world’s growing population. Yet it is unsustainable in its current form, with around half of the global population reliant on fertiliser for food production. The synthetic nitrogen supply chain alone produced an estimated 10% of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 and is often out of reach for smallholder farmers in Africa, who are working with some of the most depleted land in the world.
Recent research into plant genes has told us something with profound implications. Our cereal crops have the same ancient genetic pathway as legumes do, which allow them to engage with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
When legumes evolved the ability to associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria 100 million years ago, they used many of the processes already present in their biology to interact with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Cereals missed this evolutionary trick: they had already diverged, in evolutionary terms, from legumes.
The good news is that early research suggests it is possible to transfer legumes’ unique nitrogen-fixing properties to other food crops.
Over the last few years, researchers have dramatically increased our understanding of how plants engage with beneficial microorganisms. In the laboratory at least, we can encourage cereal crops to interact more proactively with beneficial fungi, in conditions that replicate a highly fertilised field and to begin to recapitulate the processes that we see in legumes necessary to accommodate nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Researchers are retraining plants to seek out beneficial microorganisms.
These discoveries are vital to developing cereals that can fix nitrogen without our help and access other essential nutrients through interactions with fungi. We now know that all plants have the fundamental mechanism that, up until now, only legumes have used to allow interactions with beneficial bacteria.
We can make our crops engage more proactively and productively with beneficial fungi and bacteria. And we don’t need to start from scratch to engineer cereals to be more independent.
However, it won’t be easy. There are several complicated processes involved in transferring the ability to fix nitrogen to cereals, which include developing the function to recognise beneficial bacteria.
While still in early discovery, research suggests it may be possible to grow crops without huge amounts of chemical fertilizer in the future. This has the potential to benefit smallholder farmers in low-income countries who lack access to fertilisers, and could also provide much needed reductions of agriculture’s pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It also has the promise of potentially reducing the impact of shocks such as fertiliser shortages and price spikes.
Although plants’ underground relationships with microorganisms largely go unseen, they might hold the keys to major breakthroughs in the future of farming.",How dormant plant traits could be reawakened to unlock fertiliser-free farming,environment + energy
"Around the world, natural history museums hold a treasure trove of knowledge about Earth’s animals. But much of the precious information is sealed off to genetic scientists because formalin, the chemical often used to preserve specimens, damages DNA and makes sequences hard to recover.
However, recent advances in DNA extraction techniques mean that biologists can study the genetic code of old museum specimens, which include extremely rare or even recently extinct species. We harnessed this new technology  to study a snake from the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe that was run over in 1982, and discovered it was a new species. Our research was recently published in PLOS One.
The Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe, a mountain chain on the border with Mozambique, create a haven of cool and wet habitats surrounded by savannas and dry forest. They are home to many species that are found nowhere else.
Here, a mysterious population of snakes first drew the attention of scientists around 1920. An unusual snake displaying a cobra-like defensive hooding posture was spotted in the grounds of Cecil Rhodes’ (prime minister of the Cape Colony in the late 19th century) Inyanga Estate in Nyanga.
This snake had unusual markings with red skin between its scales, creating the effect of black dots on a red background when its hood is extended. None of the other cobras found in the area match this description.
More snakes like this were reported in the 1950s, but no specimens were collected.
A rare find
The mystery surrounding these sightings piqued the interest of the late Donald G. Broadley, now considered to be the most eminent herpetologist (reptile and amphibian expert) of southern Africa. In 1961, Broadley was given some severed snake heads and identified the mystery snake as a rinkhals (Hemachatus haemachatus), a species otherwise only found in South Africa, Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) and Lesotho.
A handful of specimens were observed and measured in later years, but the landscape has been drastically altered by forestry. The rinkhals from Zimbabwe has not been seen in the wild since 1988 and is feared to be extinct.
This population lives 700km away from other, more southerly populations, which made us suspect it may be a separate species. But the genetic material contained within the specimen from Zimbabwe was degraded, meaning we couldn’t do the DNA studies needed to confirm whether it is a different species from other rinkhals.
New technology
However, the latest DNA extraction and sequencing methods have been developed over the last ten years to help biologists study the remains of ancient animals. We used the new techniques to examine the Zimbabwe rinkhals specimen. Our study showed they represent a long-isolated population, highly distinct from the southern rinkhals populations.
Based on their genetic divergence from the other rinkhals, we estimate that the snakes in Zimbabwe diverged from their southern relatives 7-14 million years ago. Counting a snake’s scales can help identify what species it is. Subtle differences in scale counts, revealed by our analysis of other specimens, provided enough evidence to classify the Zimbabwe rinkhals as a new species, Hemachatus nyangensis, the Nyanga rinkhals.
The scientific name nyangensis means “from Nyanga” in Latin.
Hemachatus nyangensis has fangs modified to spit venom, although the behaviour was not reported from the few recorded interactions with humans. The closely related true cobras (genus Naja), some of which are known to spit venom, do so with the same specialised fangs that allow venom to be forced forwards through narrow slits, spraying it toward animals that are threatening them.
Venom in the eyes causes severe pain, may damage the eye, and can cause blindness if left untreated. Venom spitting appears to have evolved three times within the broader group of cobra-like snakes, once in the rinkhals, and twice in the true cobras in south-east Asia and in Africa.
A connection between human and snake evolution
Scientists think this defence mechanism may have evolved in response to the first hominins (our ancestors). Tool-using apes who walked upright would have posed a serious threat to the snakes, and the evolution of spitting in African cobras roughly coincides with when hominins split from chimpanzees and bonobos 7 million years ago.
Similarly, the venom spitting in Asian cobras is thought to have emerged around 2.5 million years ago, which is around the time the extinct human species Homo erectus would have become a threat to those species. Our study of Nyanga rinkhals suggests that the third time venom spitting evolved independently in snakes may also have coincided with the origin of upright-walking hominins.
If a living population of Nyanga rinkhals was found, fresh DNA samples would help us to more accurately determine the timing of the split between the two species of rinkhals and how this compares to hominin evolution. Technological advances may be giving us incredible insights into ancient animal lineages but they can’t make up for an extinction. We still hope a living population of Nyanga rinkhals will be found.
The possible relationship between venom spitting and our early ancestors is a reminder that we are part of the Earth’s ecosystem. Our own evolution is intertwined with that of other animals. When animals become extinct, we don’t just lose a species - they take part of our history with them.",New species of cobra-like snake discovered – but it may already be extinct,environment + energy
"Life exists in every conceivable environment on Earth, from the peaks of towering mountains to the remote stretches of isolated islands, from sunlit surfaces to the darkest depths of the oceans. Yet, this intricate tapestry of existence isn’t spread uniformly.
For centuries, scientists have marveled at the extraordinary variety of species exhibited in tropical regions. The breathtaking biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest, the teeming life in Madagascar’s unique ecosystems, the species-rich cloud forests of Costa Rica – the tropics showcase nature’s opulence.
What makes the tropics so incredibly diverse?
Since the dawn of biodiversity studies, scientists have believed the predominant factor is climate – the long-term patterns of temperature, precipitation and other atmospheric conditions. Thinkers like Alexander von Humboldt set the stage in the early 19th century with their keen observations, highlighting how life-rich regions often shared certain climatic features. Fast-forward to the present, and scientists confidently correlate climate with biodiversity. Simply put, hotter, wetter, resource-rich regions are veritable cradles of life.
The Mediterranean climate is named after where it occurs in Southern Europe, but similar isolated conditions are scattered across the globe in parts of California, central Chile, the Western Cape of South Africa and southwestern Australia. bodrumsurf/iStock via Getty Images Plus
Some climatic conditions spread across vast landscapes, while others appear fragmented, resembling isolated islands amid varying climates. This difference raises an intriguing question: Is an area’s biodiversity solely due to its climate? Or do the size and relative isolation of these climatic pockets influence the richness and abundance of species that thrive within them?
We are part of an international, interdisciplinary team interested in the puzzle of how the geography of climate and the global patterns of species diversity fit together. Geography of climate is a bigger part of the biodiversity picture than previously assumed, according to our study findings recently published in the journal Nature.
Researchers commonly consider the geographical distribution of species, as displayed on this map highlighting the number of amphibian species across various regions of the world. Marco Túlio Pacheco Coelho
Unraveling the geography of climate
Historically, to study global biodiversity patterns, researchers divided the world into equal area grids and counted the species in each square.
Our study diverged from conventional methods. Instead of focusing solely on specific geographical locations, we centered our attention on the unique climate profiles of regions. Essentially, we weren’t just looking at plots on Earth but every place that shared a particular set of climatic conditions. We then classified these conditions globally and meticulously counted the species – birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles – that live within the boundaries of each climate.
Mapping species in this climate space, rather than traditional geographical analyses of species diversity, revealed deeper insights into the relationships between biodiversity and climate. Marco Túlio Pacheco Coelho
Central to our investigation was an exploration of the geography of these climates, examining both their size and isolation. Some climates are widespread and common, sprawling over vast areas. Others are more fragmented, emerging as isolated pockets amid different climatic zones, reminiscent of islands in a vast ocean of other diverse climates. Consider tropical climates: They cover vast expanses cumulatively, despite being broken up into smaller, unconnected bits, even on different continents.
Our findings were illuminating. Climate, of course, was an important factor in how many species flourished in a location. But we were intrigued to find that about a third of the variation we found in species diversity across the globe can be attributed solely to the size and degree of isolation of all the instances of a particular climate.

Biodiversity responds not just to the type of climate but its spatial distribution. Beyond the known effects of warmth and moisture, we found that larger and more isolated climates foster greater species diversity. Moreover, these expansive, broken-up climates not only housed a greater number of species but also nurtured a more unique combination of species.
By leveraging but transcending traditional methodologies, our approach unearthed novel insights about the geographical characteristics of climates. We discovered that the larger a climatic zone is, the more fragmented and scattered it tends to be across the landscape.
Isolation spurs diversity
Cooler extra-tropical climates connect more cohesively around the globe. Ciprian Boiciuc/Unsplash, CC BY
Traditionally, scientists have thought of tropical climates as cohesive expanses, standing as barriers between the distinct extra-tropical climates of our planet’s poles. Our analysis confirmed that cooler extra-tropical climates are relatively well connected across much of the planet.
Yet, our findings reveal a different narrative for the tropics: Tropical climates appear more as fragmented islands amid a sea of diverse climates, rather than expansive, interconnected realms. Our revelation underscores that tropical climates, while abundant, are dispersed and disjointed across the Earth’s surface.
Drawing a parallel, consider how mountainous regions harbor isolated valleys where people speak distinct dialects shaped by their seclusion. Nature mirrors this: Species in isolated climatic niches evolve distinctly, creating a diverse and unique tableau of life.
The specter of climate change, however, casts a long shadow over these insights. A world undergoing rapid warming might witness once vast climates fragmenting further. Such shifts could challenge species, compelling them to traverse daunting landscapes to find suitable habitats. If these once expansive climates recede, it could disrupt the entire balance of species interactions.
Understanding the interplay between biodiversity and climate is not merely an intellectual pursuit. It provides direction in helping people protect and appreciate the diverse symphony of life in our evolving world.",Tropical climates are the most biodiverse on Earth − but it’s not only because of how warm and wet they are,environment + energy
"Meteorites – fragments of rock that have fallen to Earth from space in spectacularly fiery meteors – have been the subject of public fascination, awe, myths and even religious worship for thousands of years.
In recent decades they’ve become a cosmic Rosetta Stone for scientists investigating the birth throes of our solar system and the organic life it hosts. Meteorites are therefore rightly classified by many countries as an integral part of communal natural heritage and are sought after by museums and private collectors.
South Africa, where I research meteorites, is one such country. In late 2021, my colleagues and I were alerted to an exceptional opportunity. Gideon Lombaard, a farmer in the Northern Cape province, reached out to us because he suspected that he had found two meteorite fragments. If proved true, these would be the first meteorite discoveries in South Africa in over 40 years.
After subjecting the fragments to a range of tests, we were able to show that the two fragments, despite being found only a kilometre apart, were unrelated – that is, they must have come from different meteor events.
In August, the Meteoritical Society’s nomenclature committee, which adjudicates all new meteorite submissions, formally accepted our proposal that the two fragments were different meteorites. They approved our suggested names – Brierskop and Wolfkop – after landmarks near their discovery sites.
Both the Brierskop (L) and Wolfkop (R) meteorites have dark fusion crusts that were chipped when the fragments hit the ground, but the darker rust of Wolfkop indicates an older fall. L. Vonopartis
Mr Lombaard’s double discovery raises South Africa’s tally of confirmed meteorites to 51 – the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Namibia has 18 confirmed meteorites, Botswana 12, Zimbabwe four, and Lesotho and eSwatini one each. But, compared with the over 14,000 meteorites recovered from the Sahara desert, the number of recovered southern African meteorites is extremely small. A concerted national meteorite education awareness and search programme could thus reap great benefits.
What is a meteorite?
A meteorite is a piece of rocky space debris that survives collision with Earth. Meteorites are usually discovered by someone who notices an unusual rock while out walking (called a “find”). However, around 2% of meteorites are classified as “falls” because they are retrieved after witnessed meteor fireball events.
Read more: Secrets revealed of 'dash-cam' meteorite that rocked Russia
The meteorite family comprises several different types of rocks. A very small proportion of the approximately 72,000 meteorites recovered globally to date are actually pieces blasted off the surfaces of the moon and Mars by giant impacts. The overwhelming majority appear to have originated in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. They are the shrapnel from past collisions between some of these asteroids that were ejected into orbits that have ended up crossing Earth’s path.
Discovery and forensics
Finding meteorites is not easy, which makes Mr Lombaard’s twin discoveries all the more significant. Because they originate in outer space, meteorites commonly contain iron in either metal or sulphide forms, both of which begin to deteriorate rapidly when they come into contact with free oxygen and water.
It is thus not surprising that nearly 80% of all meteorites have been found where arid climates aid their preservation, namely Antarctica and the Sahara desert. Meteorites typically become coated in a dark fusion crust during their fiery passage through the atmosphere. That makes the white Antarctic ice and the pale-coloured Sahara bedrock and sand perfect backdrops for searchers.
Mr Lombaard discovered the two meteorites during routine farming activities. The Brierskop meteorite is a 21.19g chondrite which he found on 18 September 2018. Chondrites are the oldest rocks in our solar system, dating back 4.567 billion years. It was only after he found the Wolfkop stone (also a chondrite, weighing 90.26g) 1km away from the Brierskop site on 27 August 2021 that he reached out to determine whether these were, as he suspected, meteorites. Contacting an expert is the best approach if you think you’ve found a meteorite.
The initial pictures he sent were very promising; our primary task was then to establish whether they represented two pieces from a single fall or had originated from separate falls.
Our analysis, which involved slicing a small piece from each stone and grinding it down to produce an ultra-thin wafer through which light from a microscope could pass, was able to show that the meteorites have distinct differences.
Brierskop contains less iron metal and less iron in its main silicate minerals than Wolfkop. The chondrules (particles in the rock) are much better preserved in Brierskop, indicating that they experienced less heating in the parent asteroid before the impact collision that liberated it. We then used the greater oxidation (rust) of the Wolfkop stone to suggest that its fall predated that of the Brierskop meteorite.
South Africa’s meteorite heritage
The South African Heritage Act No. 25 of 1999 classifies South African meteorites as national heritage items that cannot be damaged, removed, exported or traded without a permit issued by the South African Heritage Agency. The Meteoritical Society also requires that meteorites are properly stored and conserved at accredited institutions such as museums and universities for future research. Wolfkop and Brierskop are now stored at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, which is an accredited repository.
An average of between 10 and 50 meteorites are estimated to hit Earth’s surface every day. Technology will help drive new discoveries. In recent years an increasing number of countries have installed camera networks (such as NASA’s CAMS) designed to record the trajectories of meteor fireballs that can then be triangulated to try to locate the fall site. The power of citizen science is also being harnessed in many places in the form of volunteer ground searches for fallen meteorites.
Prior to the two recent discoveries, the Meteoritical Bulletin Database listed 49 meteorites as having been satisfactorily proved to be from South African sites. Mr Lombaard’s double find takes the country’s meteorite inventory above 50. There’s no doubt that more are just waiting to be found.",Meteorite discovery: unusual finds by South African farmer add to space rock heritage,science + tech
"Building collapses have become a major menace in Lagos, Nigeria. Lagos is the business hub of the country and has its largest seaport and airport. With an estimated population of 15.4 million, it is the largest city in sub-Saharan Africa and the second largest in Africa after Cairo.
The city has two distinct geographical areas: Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland, connected by three bridges. Lagos Island is the historical nucleus of the city. This area is renowned for its eclectic mix of architectural styles, a blend of modern skyscrapers, remnants of colonial-era structures and bustling traditional markets. It serves as the centre of the city’s financial, entertainment and corporate activities. Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki are popularly regarded as an extension of Lagos Island.
Lagos Mainland has residential areas, markets and industrial zones.
There have been numerous building collapses in both areas.
Using machine learning techniques, we built a model that ranked the factors affecting building construction collapses in order of relevance. We also modelled the number of casualties by location.
Read more: Knowing what leads to building collapses can help make African cities safer
The study classified causes of building collapses into human factors, natural disasters and unspecified causes. Human factors included sub-standard material, structural defects, onsite changes of plan, bad supervision, demolition processes, non-adherence to building standards and regulations, lack of geotechnical information, poor maintenance, construction defects and overload.
Based on our results we made two findings.
First, location was the most relevant factor contributing to building collapses in Lagos. We found that more buildings collapsed on the island than on the mainland.
Second, building collapses on the mainland had a higher number of casualties than those on the island.
Based on our findings, we recommended proper onsite geotechnical inspection before the start of construction in both locations.
Building the model
Our study showcased the applicability of supervised machine learning models for a range of purposes. Supervised machine learning models are algorithms that learn from labelled data, where the input (features) and corresponding desired output (labels or targets) are provided. These models are trained to recognise patterns and relationships in the data, allowing them to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.
Our study provided a comprehensive analysis of building collapse statistics in Lagos from 2000 to 2021. The buildings ranged from bungalows to multi-storey buildings and skyscrapers.
On average, four buildings collapse each year, resulting in approximately 31 casualties annually.
The highest number of collapses occurred in 2011, with 10 buildings involved, followed by 2000 and 2006, with nine each. The peak casualty count, 140, occurred in 2014. It was concentrated in the Ikotun-Egbe area of the Lagos mainland.
The differences
Our model suggested that the higher number of collapses on the island was due to the soil there. The island soil’s geotechnical properties give it poorer capacity to bear building loads.
We identified three factors for the higher number of deaths from building collapses on the mainland:
Many landowners in the mainland area ignored soil tests because they assumed it was safe to build there, given the area’s reputation of having soil that could bear heavier building loads.
The height of the building.
The quality of materials used.
To prevent future collapses and casualties
Our study emphasised the importance of understanding the causes of building collapses in Lagos, and the potential of machine learning algorithms for prediction.

We made a number of recommendations.
First, that it is important to carry out basic soil investigation using the right professionals and building engineers to ascertain the geological properties or bearing capacity of the soil.
This information would clearly identify the type of building that the soil can support.
Second, assigning the right job to the right professional is paramount. For instance, the job of a civil engineer should not be assigned to an architect.
Third, eradication of substandard materials is key to a durable structure.
Fourth, many property owners add extra floors and extensions to maximise profit. Yet the higher the building, the deeper the foundation. Geotechnical properties of the soil will determine the choice and quality of the foundation. In addition, location should determine the choice of a building foundation.
Last, there should be policies in place to enhance proper onsite geotechnical inspection.
We also recommend the use of machine learning for predicting building collapses.",Lagos building collapses: we used machine learning to show where and why they happen,science + tech
"Sixty-six million years ago, the Cretaceous period ended. Dinosaurs disappeared, along with around 90% of all species on Earth. The patterns and causes of this extinction have been debated since palaeontology began. Was it a slow, inevitable decline, or did the end come quickly, driven by a sudden, unpredictable disaster?
Georges Cuvier, working in the early 19th century, was one of the first palaeontologists. He believed that geological catastrophes, or “revolutions”, drove waves of sudden extinction. In part, his ideas were formed by study of a giant sea lizard, Mosasaurus, that lived and went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous.
Skull of the marine lizard Mosasaurus studied by Cuvier. Nick Longrich.
Charles Darwin saw the end of the Cretaceous rather differently. He thought extinctions happened gradually, driven by everyday processes working over many millions of years, just as sedimentation and erosion slowly reshaped the land.
The debate continued for over a century, but the idea of catastrophic extinction gained ground as palaeontologists collected more fossil species, timing species’ appearances and disappearances. Massive numbers of species disappeared near the end of the Cretaceous,  rapidly, around the world, both on land and in the sea. These severe, rapid, worldwide extinctions implied a severe, worldwide, rapid cause – a catastrophe.
Finally, in 1980 physicist Luis Alvarez identified a possible driver of the extinctions – a giant asteroid impact, later traced back to an enormous crater beneath the town of Chicxulub, in Mexico. Debris shot into the upper atmosphere by the impact blocked out the sun, causing photosynthesis to stop, and temperatures to plunge.
This didn’t end the debate, however. Some have argued that other events, like volcanic eruption, contributed, or even that the dinosaurs were already on their way out. In these scenarios, the asteroid impact was one of many factors driving the extinctions, or perhaps the final blow to groups in decline.
Recently I’ve been working as part of a team of palaeontologists studying new marine reptiles from the latest Cretaceous of north Africa. We’ve found a huge number of mosasaur species, close relatives of the Mosasaurus that Cuvier studied. Our research suggests that mosasaurs remained diverse until the very end. As they were the dominant predators of the day, their evolution tells us about the evolution of the marine ecosystem as a whole, and suggests marine ecosystems remained diverse until a sudden, catastrophic collapse caused by the asteroid impact.
Cretaceous marine reptiles
Near the end of the Cretaceous, sea levels were high, submerging much of Africa underwater. The Tethys Sea, which would eventually become the Mediterranean Sea, flooded the Sahara; the Atlantic extended east across north Africa as far as Morocco’s Atlas Mountains.
Meanwhile, the trade winds drove to the east, as they do now. Wind pushed surface waters offshore, causing upwelling of nutrient-rich waters from the ocean floor along the eastern Atlantic, fertilising the seas, and driving vast plankton blooms. Phytoplankton fed zooplankton, feeding small fish and ammonites, feeding larger animals, and so on up the food chain.
And an extraordinary diversity of marine reptiles sat atop the food chain: giant sea turtles, long-necked plesiosaurs – and the mosasaurs.
When these animals died, their skeletons, along with fish bones and shark teeth, formed vast bonebeds. These beds, in what’s now Morocco, are today mined for fertiliser, in the process revealing an extraordinary marine ecosystem from the last days of the Cretaceous.
Far from declining at the end of the Cretaceous, marine reptiles – especially mosasaurs – evolved to become increasingly diverse. Mosasaurs show a range of body sizes, from a few metres long to giants over 10 metres long. They also evolved an astonishing variety of tooth shapes: hooks, spikes, cones, blades, crushing molars.
Recent years have seen a remarkable number of new species emerge, including many strange, specialised forms. Pluridens serpentis had a mouth full of small, hooked, snakelike teeth. It probably ate small, soft prey, like fish and squid.
Illustration of the mosasaur Xenodens feeding on a plesiosaur carcass. Andrey Atuchin.
The bizarre little Xenodens had bladelike teeth, packed edge-to-edge to create a sawlike cutting blade. This arrangement is unique among lizards, or even reptiles. It likely used its teeth to saw apart larger prey or scavenge from carcasses.
The 10-metre long Thalassotitan had massive, conical teeth like a killer whale’s. It was an apex predator, eating plesiosaurs, sea turtles – and other mosasaurs.

The tooth of Thalassotitan was designed to tear apart other mosasaurs. Nick Longrich.
The most recently recently discovered species we named Stelladens, or “star tooth”. Most mosasaurs had a bladelike cutting edge on the front and back of each tooth. In Stelladens, a series of two to four extra ridges run down the tooth, giving the teeth a shape like a Phillips-head screw driver or a hex wrench. Nothing quite like it has been seen in a mosasaur before, or anything else. What did it eat with its odd teeth? We don’t know.
The strange teeth of Stelladens mysteriosus. Nick Longrich.
Resilience and adaptability
Mosasaurs were just one of many kinds of animals inhabiting the seas, but as predators they tell us a lot. The reason so many mosasaur species could coexist was that they specialised, targeting different prey with different hunting strategies, avoiding competition.
For the marine reptiles at the top of the food chain to be so diverse, there had to be diverse prey species on lower levels of the food chain. The diversity of mosasaurs suggests the marine ecosystem was healthy and stable in the last million years before the Cretaceous period ended. This supports the theory that the end-Cretaceous extinction was driven by a sudden catastrophic event – the asteroid – rather than resulting from a slow, gradual decline.
Seen on longer timescales, over millions of years, life shows remarkable resilience and adaptability, and a certain orderliness. Species evolve, diversify, and become better adapted. But even the most successful, well-adapted species is only one catastrophe away from extinction— one asteroid, one volcano, one ice age. That raises the unsettling possibility that our own species’ continued existence isn’t certain, either. The next catastrophe could be the one that ends our species.
And yet at the same time, the asteroid impact that wiped out marine reptiles and the dinosaurs made the world around us possible. The extinction of mosasaurs and plesiosaurs allowed the evolution of dolphins, whales and seals. The dinosaurs’ extinction drove the evolution of horses, lions, elephants, humans. One world was wiped away by catastrophe, but out of that disaster, something new, remarkable, and surprising – our world, and the species we share it with – was born.","Giant sea lizards: fossils in Morocco reveal the astounding diversity of marine life 66 million years ago, just before the asteroid hit",science + tech
"When a Virgin Galactic commercial flight soared into space on 8 September 2023, there were two Virgin Galactic pilots, an instructor and three passengers on board – as well as two fossils of ancient prehuman relatives from South Africa. Timothy Nash, a businessman, carried a clavicle belonging to Australopithecus sediba and the thumb bone of a Homo naledi specimen. The fossils’ brief journey – the VSS Unity’s flight lasted just an hour – was organised by palaeontologist Lee Berger, who led the team that discovered and described Homo naledi in 2015. Berger was granted an export permit in July by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA) to take the fossils from the country to the US launch site for VSS Unity. SAHRA is a “national administrative body responsible for the protection of South Africa’s cultural heritage”.
The event has drawn the ire of scores of human evolution researchers from South Africa and beyond. Some have labelled it “unethical” and a “publicity stunt”. Berger issued a brief statement on X (formerly Twitter) on 25 September addressing the situation. And SAHRA, in a statement quoted by Nature, said it was “satisfied that the promotional benefit derived was appropriately weighted against the inherent risk of travel of this nature”.
The Conversation Africa asked Dipuo Winnie Kgotleng, director of the Palaeo-Research Institute at the University of Johannesburg, and Robyn Pickering, co-director of the Human Evolution Research Institute at the University of Cape Town, why the space flight created such unhappiness.
Why are scientists so angry about the fossils being sent to space?
There are a number of reasons.
One is the threat to South African heritage. According to the SAHRA permitting policy, fossils of this nature are only allowed to travel for scientific purposes and should be securely packed to prevent damage. The fossils travelled in space in a sealed tube – and were then kept in an individual’s pocket as he floated freely.
There is no scientific reason for allowing these fossils to travel to space. No new knowledge has been generated and no community, either local or international, has been engaged on this science.
Also, doses of radiation which these specimens were exposed to during this trip could have potentially permanently altered the fossil microstructure, affecting any data which might be required in the future.
A second issue is that the A. sediba clavicle is a type specimen: it is the original physical example of the species and, if such a specimen is lost or destroyed, it is gone forever.
Finally, this event demonstrated the unequal power relations at play in accessing this invaluable heritage. Some local communities – like the people of Taung, where a 2.8 million year old child’s skull nicknamed the Taung Child was discovered in 1924 – have requested access to fossil specimens that originated from their areas. In the case of the Taung Child, there have reportedly been discussions “over a long time” to have the skull returned by the university where it is stored.
So, is it only wealthy, famous rich white men who can have access to fossils? Poor communities do not have access to the same privileges?
Professor Berger’s SAHRA application called the fossils’ space flight a ‘once in a lifetime opportunity to bring awareness to science, exploration, human origins and South Africa and its role in understanding Humankind’s shared African ancestry’.
We completely disagree. Which community has been engaged in science awareness? Surely no South African or any African community has been engaged through this act?

Some have argued that the space flight echoes colonial attitudes to human remains. How so?
This is an example of what we call neo-colonialism. The science of human evolution has a long, dark past of exploitation and extraction. The main perpetrators of this past were privileged white men, so this latest event feels familiar but is really not OK in 2023.

Our field is just beginning to grapple with its past, and we’ve made some progress in the last decade. Something like this puts us right back into the olden days.
So what happens next?
Several professional bodies in various African regions have issued statements expressing their unhappiness about the treatment of the fossils.
Various arms of the palaeoscience community, such as the Association of Southern African Professional Archaeologists, have directly asked SAHRA and the Cradle of Humankind Management Authority (which is responsible for preserving the world heritage site where the fossils were found) and the government to address us and the South African public more broadly.
We are also pushing for these organisations to reflect on this issue and to discuss changes to their permitting policy. We’re confident that the outrage we’ve demonstrated will guard against something like this happening again in the future.
September is Heritage Month in South Africa, a time when we are asked to come together as a country, to celebrate, learn about and explore our heritage as a way to build unity in a diverse society. Our common heritage, represented by the fossils, is a great tool for bringing us together as a country. Treating the same fossils in this way goes against this noble aim.

"Climate change has negatively – and irreversibly, in some cases – affected ecosystems around the globe. Sadly, though, it is not the only phenomenon that’s altering our natural world.
In 2019, the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment Report confirmed invasive alien species as one of the five most important direct drivers of biodiversity loss. The others were climate change, land and sea use, direct exploitation of species, and pollution.
IPBES, an independent intergovernmental body, was established in 2012. It now has 144 member countries; Somalia, the newest member, joined in mid-September. Its major objective is to strengthen the interface between science and policy to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity.
The 2019 assessment found that more than 37,000 alien species had been introduced by many human activities to regions and biomes around the world, most in the past 100 years. A new report by the organisation, focused on alien invasive species, suggests this number is rising fast, with new alien species being recorded at an unprecedented rate of approximately 200 annually. It also reveals that the global economic cost of invasive alien species exceeded US$423 billion annually. Costs have at least quadrupled every decade since 1970.
But the new report doesn’t just concentrate on problems. It also offers solutions. It outlines key responses and policy options that governments may take for prevention, early detection and effective control of invasive alien species. Doing so will help to safeguard nature and its contributions to people. This will ensure a better quality of life for all.
Read more: The true damage of invasive alien species was just revealed in a landmark report. Here's how we must act
I am an invasion biologist whose research focuses on the ecology and management of invasive aquatic plants. Here, I elaborate on the four key messages highlighted by the report that African countries should heed if the continent is to successfully tackle the threats posed by invasive species.
Key messages
1: Invasive alien species are a major threat to nature, its contributions to people, and good quality of life.
In Africa, invasive species threaten food security by negatively affecting fish production, agricultural productivity, grazing and water supplies.
The introduction of the Nile perch, Lates niloticus, into East Africa’s Lake Victoria in 1954 is one of the most extreme examples. Predation by this species caused the extinction of approximately 200 species of cichlids from the lake. It is considered to represent the largest extinction event among vertebrates during the 20th century.
The invasion also resulted in the shallow lake becoming enriched with nutrients as people came to fish for Nile perch. This resulted in the widespread invasion of the lake by water hyacinth. The plant restricted access to the lake, which prevented transport and fishing.
2: Globally, invasive alien species and their impacts are increasing rapidly and are predicted to continue rising in the future. Accurate data is crucial.
A 2021 research study highlighted that the reported economic costs of invasive aquatic species were unevenly distributed across geographic regions. Africa, the Oceania-Pacific Islands and the Antarctic-Subantarctic, combined, accounted for only 0.6% of the US$345 billion global estimate. That’s not because the costs are really that low. The data simply isn’t being recorded, so we’re not getting the full picture.
African countries need to partner with their neighbours in better quantifying the situation.
3: Invasive alien species and their negative impact can only be prevented and mitigated through effective management.
In 2011 the Convention on Biological Diversity released its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The 20 targets were designed to address and mitigate biodiversity loss across the globe. Target 9 stated that, by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways should be identified and prioritised. Priority species should be controlled or eradicated, and measures taken to block new pathways.
But none of those targets were met. And there has been little or no progress recorded in some African countries. Today, invasive species are reported to be adversely affecting livelihoods in more than 70% of African countries.
Constrained financial resources and the lack of legal frameworks and related operational systems are largely to blame for the lack of progress. For example, there is a huge lack of capacity, mainly at ports of entry – which are the most crucial step in preventing invasions.
Many regions still have to enhance their management plans for effective control of invasive species, starting with identification of common invasive species.
4: There are success stories on the continent – lessons should be shared across borders.
In South Africa, the management of alien plant invasions has been actively supported by the government’s Working for Water programme since 1995.
Read more: Invasive alien plants in South Africa pose huge risks, but they can be stopped
A study in 2022 estimated that an average of R310 million (adjusted to 2020 values) had been spent every year on work that covered 2.7 million hectares across more than 76,000 sites. This doesn’t mean plant invasions are totally under control. But it is clear that, without this kind of programme, the situation would be far worse.
The study recommended that the programme’s future efforts must focus on clearly defined priority sites, improving planning and monitoring, and increasing operational efficiency. These are all valuable lessons for other African countries.
An African lens
Its new report did not focus on any one part of the world, but IPBES has previously been clear about the importance of biodiversity to African nations. In a 2018 regional assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services For Africa, the organisation wrote that
biodiversity and nature’s contributions in Africa are economically, socially and culturally important, essential in providing the continent’s food, water, energy, health and secure livelihood, and represent a strategic asset for sustainable development and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Most of the data in the newest report comes from the northern hemisphere, as this is where most of the research is conducted, and where the majority of funding comes from.
Different countries and regions will have different needs. That’s where the value of regional coordination and knowledge-sharing becomes clear.",Invasive alien species are a serious threat to the planet: 4 key messages for Africa,environment + energy
"Ding! The courier hands me an unassuming brown box with “live animals” plastered on the side. I begin carefully unboxing. The cardboard exterior gives way to a white polystyrene clamshell, cloistering a pearly sphere-shaped, water-filled bag. Lightly pulsing, I spot them: three cannonball jellyfish (Stomolophus meleagris). Each the size of a 50-pence coin.
After months of waiting, my first gelatinous companions had arrived and I was finally ready to begin my research on human connections with jellyfish.
Cannonball jellyfish are an unusual pet choice. Whether stinging beachgoers, clogging power station intake pipes, or outcompeting more popular ocean wildlife, jellyfish are often labelled nuisances.
Despite their poor press, they have a growing community of admirers. Thousands of people drift to aquariums each year to admire jellyfish. Darting around and bumping into one another, tentacles circling or gently pulsing they inspire delight in their guests. The Californian Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Jellyfish: Living Art was the organisation’s most popular and long-running exhibit since opening in 1984.
Jellyfish not only have the ability to captivate us. It may also benefit our health. A study has shown eating cannonball jellyfish, for example, can reduce the effects of arthritis – albeit so far only in a small group of rats.
A biological wonder
Perhaps more importantly, however, we can learn a lot from studying the incredible biology of jellyfish. For example, immortal jellyfish (Turritopsis dohrnii) sidestep the ageing process by reverting to their polyp stage.
Crystal jellies’ (Aequorea victoria) green fluorescent protein (GFP), found in organs within the animal’s bell, allows scientists to study gene expression. Gene expression is the instruction manual DNA follows, for example, to become proteins. This process can be quite complex and difficult to follow. But the GFP lights up under ultraviolet light, which helps scientists map the different processes a cell goes through as it follows DNA instructions.
Jellyfish deserve more of the public’s attention. They are a major player in the marine food web and have complex relationships with other wildlife. For example, cannonball jellyfish have a fascinating relationship with young spider crabs (Libinia spp.) that live inside their bells. This gives the crabs security and research suggests jellyfish hosting crabs grow larger than those without, but it’s not clear why.

Some scientists say jellyfish are climate-change survivors, which they don’t mean as a compliment. Despite rising temperatures, they sometimes “jellify” the ocean because of their sudden population “blooms”. However, they have their own climate-change-related problems.
For example, temperature increases in Palau’s Jellyfish Lake in the South Pacific have been linked to the disappearance of golden jellyfish (Mastigias papua). Jellyfish blooms are also often followed by crashes in their populations, which are caused by several overlapping factors such as food shortage, predation, parasites, disease, weather and getting stranded on beaches.
Sea curiosities
There are so many reasons humans should make an effort to understand jellyfish better. Research suggests ocean literacy is best cultivated through hands-on experience and personal interactions. But the technology aquariums use to bring jellyfish to the masses limit how involved audiences can be with the animals.
Cannonball jellyfish in a kit aquarium. Matthew Beach
Although scientists have argued technology can damage people’s relationships with other animals, it can help us reconnect with our environment too.
Because jellyfish are 95% water, they are extremely sensitive to their surroundings. Most kit tanks (often referred to as nano aquariums) hold a small water volume, which makes it difficult to maintain the right conditions such as pH, ammonia levels and temperature.
Bacteria must be introduced into the tank to control jellyfish waste (ammonia) by converting it into nitrite and then nitrate. These bacteria are similar to the oxygen-producing microbes in the ocean that form the basis of all ocean food webs, and help maintain the ocean cycle. The nitrate is removed by replacing small amounts of aquarium water with purified salt water.
As I discovered, if these conditions are not maintained, the jellyfish can suffer from bell holes (small circular tears in jellyfishes’ bells) and eversion (when the outer portion of the bell inverts). When aquarium jellyfish suffer eversion, high water temperature is often the culprit. Learning how to care for jellyfish in these kits is learning about their complex relationships to our oceans.
The closer we feel to our environment, the more likely we are to fight to protect it. So next time you visit the seaside or your local aquarium, try to slow down, absorb the experience and see if you can learn something new about jellyfish and wider ocean wildlife.",Jellyfish: our complex relationship with the oceans’ anti-heroes,science + tech
"Snakes are familiar, distinctive – and often feared – reptiles. And they’ve been around for a long time: body fossils found in the UK, Portugal and the US stretch all the way back to the late Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago.
Until now, though, there hasn’t been a single description of a surface fossilised snake trace – a mark on a surface that’s become cemented and re-exposed over time – anywhere in the world.
There are probably several reasons for this. One is that the tracks of large quadrupeds (four-legged animals), including dinosaurs, are easier to recognise than those of snakes. Another reason could be that snakes tend to avoid sandy or muddy areas in which their trails could be registered, preferring vegetated terrain. Maybe, as the weight of the snake is distributed over its entire length, the trails are shallow and are not easy to identify.
Or perhaps researchers are not adequately familiar with the types of traces that snakes can create.
We are part of an ichnological team – experts in identifying fossil tracks and traces. In a recently published article in the journal Ichnos, we described the first snake trace in the fossil record, which we found on South Africa’s Cape south coast. It dates to the Pleistocene epoch, and our studies have shown that it was probably made between 93,000 and 83,000 years ago, almost certainly by a puff adder (Bitis arietans).
As this is a world first, our research team was obliged to create a new ichnogenus and ichnospecies, Anguinichnus linearis, to describe the distinctive pattern in the sand registered by the puff adder.
A snake and a buffalo
The puff adder is a not uncommon sight on the Cape south coast today and, with good reason, strikes fear into residents and visitors: its cytotoxic (tissue-destroying) venom can cause the loss of a limb or worse. It habitually suns itself on trails, staying motionless, and then strikes without warning.

We found the trace fossil in the Walker Bay Nature Reserve (adjacent to Grootbos Private Nature Reserve), just over 100 kilometres south-east of Cape Town.
Intriguingly, a long-horned buffalo – an extinct species – had walked across the same dune surface soon after the snake left its trace. We know this because one of the buffalo’s tracks is superimposed on the puff adder trace, slightly deforming it.

The puff adder and long-horned buffalo traces were found on the surface of a loose slab, 3 metres long and 2.6 metres wide, which had become dislodged and fallen down onto the beach from overlying cliffs. The slab is submerged twice a day by high tides. We were fortunate to discover it when its surface was bare, as repeat visits have shown that it is often covered in algae or by a thick layer of beach sand.
Snakes in motion
Snakes use four main types of locomotion. Each results in distinctive, recognisable traces.
Here’s how snakes move through the world.
Puff adders are heavy, thick-set snakes with an average adult length of less than a metre. They mostly employ rectilinear motion, leaving a linear, sometimes slightly undulating trace, often with a central drag mark registered by the tail tip. In this form of motion the snake uses its weight and its belly muscles and grips rough areas on the surface with the posterior edges of its scales. It is drawn forwards through the muscular contractions, creating a linear trace.

We also found possible trace evidence at other sites on the Cape south coast of sidewinding and undulatory motion, but this was inconclusive. We will be looking for further, more conclusive evidence.
Filling important gaps
The newly described puff adder traces help fill a gap in the Pleistocene trace fossil record from the region. More than 350 vertebrate tracksites have been identified, of mammals, birds and reptiles. Most of these sites were registered on dune surfaces, which have now become cemented into aeolianites and re-exposed. Our latest find is yet another global first for the Cape south coast.

With other vertebrate groups, such as dinosaurs and crocodiles, the trace fossil record has substantially augmented the body fossil record, providing new insights. Hopefully this discovery will act as a spur to identify other snake traces from around the world from older deposits, and thus increase our understanding of the evolution of snakes and help to fill a substantial gap in the global trace fossil record.",Fossil snake traces: another world-first find on South Africa’s Cape south coast,science + tech
"A series of powerful tidal surges battered coastal areas in South Africa’s Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces over the weekend of 16 September. One person died; cars, homes and businesses were damaged. The Conversation Africa asked Jasper Knight, a geoscientist who researches coastal processes, to explain what happened.
What drove the flooding?
A critical combination of three factors resulted in this significant flooding. First, a storm surge associated with low-pressure weather systems coming onshore. These happen very commonly but often don’t result in high amounts of flooding by themselves.
Second, low-pressure cells often result in strong onshore winds, and these can whip up the sea surface and create big waves which can potentially run further inland, especially when the sea surface is raised.
Third, the coincidence of the storm with the period of high tide (a monthly event) and equinoctial high-high tide (a seasonal event). It is this combination that is the cause here, not these individual factors in isolation.
What is a storm surge?
This is where the level of the sea surface near the coast is temporarily raised up and results in flooding along that coastal stretch. Storm surges are caused by a low pressure (cyclone) weather system approaching the coastline from the ocean. Low pressure causes the sea surface to bulge upwards below the centre or eye of the cyclone, and the magnitude of this disturbance is related to the severity of the low pressure system – the deeper the low pressure cell, the higher the elevation of the sea surface. This is usually on the order of tens of centimetres to one metre or so.
As the cyclone approaches land, the water surface along the coast rises.
What is a spring tide?
Despite their name, spring tides are regular occurrences throughout the year. They take place when the sun, Earth and moon are in alignment, and this happens once every (lunar) month. In addition, there are also times of the year, around the equinoxes, where spring tides are higher than average.
We are very near the spring (vernal) equinox in the southern hemisphere (which is on or about 22 September). This is a period when the sun is aligned overhead of Earth’s equator and so exerts a bigger tidal force on the oceans. This may have been a contributing factor to the higher water levels around the coast.
Were people sufficiently warned?
Tidal patterns are highly predictable and this data is widely available for ports or harbours along the coast. In this case, the South African Weather Service issued a warning. This information is particularly useful for boaters, fishermen and other coastal users. Weather patterns are also fairly predictable, which is what weather forecasting is all about, so we know when a big storm may be approaching.
Read more: The science of weather forecasting: what it takes and why it’s so hard to get right
However, the net result of all of these factors in combination is less predictable: although low-lying coastal areas are vulnerable to flooding, forecasters may not know exactly when or how high.
The other issue here is not just areas being covered by water but also the speed at which the water waves are moving, which is a factor in their destructiveness.
What kind of emergency measures could be put in place?
Local communities need to be warned more clearly and effectively if there is a threat of a storm surge and of coastal flooding. People and assets (like cars, anything that is moveable) should be moved from the area or kept inside. People tend to want to go to the sea to watch the waves but this puts them at more risk. Roads should be closed off where possible to keep people safe and away from the area. Floodwater management through using sandbags and similar actions should be undertaken.
Exactly the same measures used in places like Florida in the US for reducing hurricane risk should be used in South Africa, such as boarding up windows, keeping assets indoors, evacuating people from high risk areas, and moving furniture in houses to the first floor to reduce flood impacts.
Storm surges – and sea levels rising in future – are not going to go away so we need to be prepared for them.",South Africa’s destructive storm surges: geoscientist reveals the 3 factors that drove them,science + tech
"If you are allergic to pollen, you are likely to curse the existence of these microscopic particles. You’re not alone: up to 30% of the world’s population suffers from hay fever, which is often driven by pollen allergies. Shifting global climates are likely to push that figure even higher.
However, pollen represents one of the most powerful tools to uncover the nature of past environmental change.
I am the head of the Palaeoecology Laboratory at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa. My research focuses on unravelling the secrets of ancient environments and ecosystems by examining fossil pollen grains. These tiny time capsules hold a wealth of information about the earth’s past. They help scientists to reconstruct ecosystems, track climate change and understand the evolution of plant life.
But it can be difficult to source pollen deposits in arid regions. That’s because such deposits are often found in large lakes, which are in short supply in southern Africa. That’s where an unlikely scientific ally enters the picture: the fossilised urine of a small mammal, the rock hyrax (South Africans call them “dassies”).
Looking back
Pollen grains are incredibly durable because they are made of an organic substance (called sporopollenin) that is very resistant to decay. Pollen is released into the air, often in large quantities, and can settle on surfaces like lakes, and become preserved in sediment deposits over thousands, or even millions, of years.
In the lab, we examine the pollen found in these deposits using a microscope. By identifying the different types of pollen grains found within the different layers (representing different time slices) we can reconstruct the area’s vegetation history. Plants grow under specific climatic conditions: for instance, desert plants can grow under low rainfall conditions whereas forest plants need high amounts of rainfall. So we can make inferences about the climate at the time that the pollen was incorporated into the deposit.
The fossilised urine of rock hyraxes helps in the study of pollen. Kiev Victor
As I’ve said, southern Africa’s arid climates mean there are very few large lakes in the region. This makes it a challenge to source deposits that adequately preserve pollen within them over long periods of time. That’s where fossilised dassie urine comes in.
These sticky deposits called “middens” accumulate in rock crevices in mountainous areas over thousands to tens of thousands of years and contain beautifully preserved pollen grains. As they also contain various other types of evidence (such as geochemical data) and can be accurately dated, they represent the most valuable archive of past climate data in southern Africa. The oldest middens we’ve worked with date back 50,000 years.
Ancient sites
The research my lab conducts, focusing on harnessing the power of the humble pollen grain and utilising unique archives such as hyrax middens, is strongly multidisciplinary. It draws together elements from botany, geography, geology, climatology and archaeology.
We are currently generating fossil pollen records from several sites within the Cape Fold Belt mountains of South Africa. For example, we have a midden sequence that covers the last 6,000 years from the Baviaanskloof in the Eastern Cape province. The fossil pollen from this sequence shows that there was a dramatic shift in vegetation about 3,300 years ago, driven by a large fire event and increased temperatures. We’re hoping to publish this research soon.
This information provides baselines of variability in natural systems and can help inform current conservation efforts within the Baviaanskloof, which is a biodiversity hotspot.
Another project that we are involved in is centred on the archaeological excavation within South Africa’s southern Cape region at a site called Boomplaas Cave. By using the fossil pollen within hyrax middens found within the vicinity of Boomplaas Cave, we hope to provide the environmental context to the archaeological record which can help to decipher how early humans responded to climate change.
And looking forward
We are not only working within the realm of the past: as pollen is one of the main sources of allergies it is important to monitor the types and amounts of pollen currently present in the air we breathe. My lab is part of the South African Pollen Monitoring network and we generate pollen data for the city of Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape province.
This initiative focuses on analysing pollen captured in the air across several different parts of South Africa and ensuring that this information is publicly available. This project is particularly important as, due to climate change, pollen seasons are lengthening and allergenic pollen is increasing.",Pollen in pee: fossilised urine from a small African mammal helps us understand past environments,science + tech
"When and where did our ancestors first fashion footwear? We cannot look to physical evidence of shoes for the answer, as the perishable materials from which they were made would no longer be evident. Ichnology, the study of fossil tracks and traces, can help to answer this unresolved question through a search for clear evidence of footprints made by humans who were shod – that is, wearing some kind of foot covering.
But this is no simple endeavour, as our research team from the Cape south coast ichnology project in South Africa recently reported. Over the past 15 years we have identified more than 350 vertebrate tracksites along the Cape coast. These include a number of tracks made by humans who were clearly walking or jogging barefoot, as evidenced by toe impressions. But we also noticed similar trackways, seemingly well preserved, that contained no toe impressions. Realising, too, that very little research has been done about when humans first fashioned footwear, we decided to investigate further.
To do so, we studied relevant research from various parts of the world, using our knowledge about milestones in human technological development such as when and where our ancestors had the technology to create bone tools which could have been used for sewing.
We also considered the areas where ancient hominin tracks have been reported. This revealed that there are two prime places on the planet to look for footprint evidence of early shod hominins: western Europe and the Cape coast of South Africa. We followed up with a little crafting of our own to create the types of footwear that might have been worn. Most of the tracksites we have found are between about 70,000 years and 150,000 years in age, so that is the time period we focused on.
Our findings, recently published in the journal Ichnos, suggest that there are at least three tracksites on the Cape south coast that might have been made by shod humans (a fourth site unfortunately rapidly deteriorated in quality and slumped into the sea). The global record of sites attributed to shod trackmakers is sparse. Until now, only four sites older than 30,000 years have been postulated, all from western Europe, including a Neanderthal site.
Though the evidence is not conclusive, we are excited about our discoveries. They support the notion of southern Africa being one region where human cognitive and practical ability developed a very long time ago.
The study
We considered the published studies on possible shod-human tracks from western Europe, and searched the Cape coast for similar sites. Today, the ancient dune surfaces our ancestors walked along are cemented and preserved as aeolianites. We have previously reported on the tracks of our barefoot Homo sapiens ancestors along this coastline and now focused on three sites which appeared to be of hominin origin and were crisply outlined, but contained no evidence of toe impressions.
Next, we drew on our knowledge of sandals used by the indigenous San people on the sands of the Kalahari desert to give us ideas about what ancient footwear might have looked like. After studying museum specimens, depictions of footwear in the San rock art record and the oldest surviving examples of footwear, it was time to do a little cobbling.
We crafted various types of footwear and used them to create trackways on the beaches and dunes of the Cape south coast; then we analysed them.
Read more: Graffiti threatens precious evidence of ancient life on South Africa's coast
From these experiments it became clear that an open, hard sole design, with tracks made on moist, moderately soft but nonetheless cohesive sand, best fitted the findings at the three fossil tracksites.
Preservation and clarity
Usually, to identify hominin tracks, the presence and alignment of toe impressions is a crucial factor. Clearly such features are unlikely to be present in the tracks of ancestral humans using footwear. We needed to ensure that the findings suggesting shod hominins were genuine rather than being due to poor preservation, or erosion, or that the tracks had simply been made in soft sand by barefoot humans.
Read more: World's oldest _Homo sapiens_ footprint identified on South Africa's Cape south coast
Crisp track margins therefore became an essential feature at our three sites. Tracks had to have an approximate hominin footprint outline. Strap attachment points, if they left marks in the tracks, formed a welcome bonus.
None of the three sites has been dated at this point, although nearby dated sites suggest that they range in age from around 70,000 years to more than 130,000 years old.
While our evidence is suggestive, we do not consider it conclusive as yet. We’re searching for further sites which ideally, in addition to displaying good preservation, would contain long trackways to allow for detailed analysis.
Why make footwear?
One obvious question stemming from this research is why our ancestors would have elected to create footwear, whereas up until that point they had survived barefoot.
Perhaps once they had developed the means to create complex clothing through bone tools, footwear might have been a logical addition. Anyone who has tried to forage on the Cape coast today knows how sharp some of the rocks are and how easy it is to suffer a laceration if not wearing shoes. In the Middle Stone Age, about 130,000 years ago, an infected laceration might well have been a death sentence.
Protection from extremes of heat and cold might also have been incentives, and the use of footwear might initially have been occasional or intermittent.",Ancient shoes: tracks on a South African beach offer oldest evidence yet of human footwear,science + tech
"A typical west African menu is not complete without a fermented food or drink. These are foods that have been transformed by natural processes involving “friendly” microorganisms like bacteria or yeast. The microorganisms break down the sugars and other substances in the food, which changes the taste and texture, and sometimes even preserves the food.
Some examples of fermented foods from the region are those made from African locust beans, such as iru (Nigeria), dawadawa (Ghana), netetu (Senegal) and afitin (Benin). Other products include okpehe (Nigeria), soydawadawa (Ghana), ogiri (east Nigeria), and Burkina Faso’s bikalga and soumbala.
Fermented foods are rich in protein, dietary fibre, and essential minerals such as iron, calcium, and potassium. Although many of these foods are used as condiments, they also serve as low-cost meat substitutes due to their high protein content and taste.
The alkalinity of these fermented foods helps preserve them, because microorganisms (which cause food to spoil) don’t grow so easily in alkaline substances.
However, there are safety concerns with some of these foods. Risks can arise in the way they are prepared and the quality of the fermentation process.
As a microbiologist, I’ve studied west African alkaline fermented foods and highlighted some safety issues they present. I’ve also suggested ways to make these foods safer.
Food safety risks
Iru (African locust beans) and other legume-based products provide essential amino acids and are a rich source of protein and fibre. Dawadawa contains antioxidants that help protect cells from oxidative damage (cell damage caused by stress).
But one safety concern is the contamination risk from mycotoxins and bacteria related to poor hygiene. Mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by certain moulds that can contaminate crops during growth, harvest, storage or processing.
Mycotoxins are capable of causing diseases or even death in humans and other animals. The adverse health effects of mycotoxins range from acute poisoning to long-term effects such as immune deficiency and cancer. Heavy exposure to aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxin, causes liver damage, jaundice, haemorrhage and oedema. Lower exposure to aflatoxin over a long time may cause immunosuppression and cancer.
Unregulated traditional practices, which may involve unhygienic utensils and handling, can pose a threat to food safety by introducing bacteria that can survive alkaline conditions.

Also, fermented food products often use salt as a preservative. Consuming too much salt may adversely affect health and worsen conditions like cardiovascular diseases and stroke.
So, to minimise the safety risks of fermented foods, it is important to reduce the amount of salt and to store foods properly. Inspect grains and seeds, and discard any that look mouldy, discoloured, or shrivelled. Avoid damage to grains before and during drying, and in storage.
Food safety requires action and cooperation in five areas: agriculture, food technology, nutrition, microbiology, and regulations.
Five approaches to safer fermented foods
Agriculture
The quality and safety of fermented foods lies in the quality of the “substrate” it’s made from, such as legumes. Starting a fermentation process with low quality substrates creates a high risk of introducing potentially pathogenic bacteria and fungi, or toxins produced by them. Seeds and other agricultural produce used must be of high quality and certified safe for human consumption.
Food technology
Safe alkaline fermentation requires careful control of production conditions. Inadequate fermentation time and sub-optimal temperature may not produce the enzymes that kill pathogens and prevent toxins.
Nutrition
Generally, very little research has been done on the nutritional composition of fermented products. There’s a need for more data on this. Studies should explore what influences the nutritional content of the products, such as soil characteristics, climate and the state of maturity at harvest. Data should be collected and analysed throughout the process, from the farm to processing and consumption stages. A robust measure of nutrient composition would help to formulate recommendations on daily intakes.
Microbiology
The safety of the particular strains of organisms used in fermentation needs more investigation. Molecular and genomics tools could be used to identify the enzyme producing species and strains in these fermented foods.
Regulation
Food regulations, policies and monitoring are needed in west African countries to overcome local challenges. Among various interventions, food handlers should be educated by food safety bodies on essential microbiology, hygiene and sanitation as it concerns their products. Monitoring of compliance during production, packaging and storage in the market is essential.
The culinary traditions of west Africa offer a treasure trove of flavours and experiences. Alkaline fermented foods, with their distinctive tastes, textures and aromas, also offer potential health benefits. With high-quality substrates, appropriate starter cultures, the right hygiene practices, optimal pH and temperature in production, and proper storage and packaging, consumers can enjoy the region’s fermented delicacies with confidence.",Fermented food is a staple in west Africa: 5 ways to make sure it’s safe for eating,science + tech
"We carry them everywhere, take them to bed, to the bathroom and for many people they’re the first thing they see in the morning – more than 90% of the world owns or uses a mobile phone and many of us couldn’t manage without one.
But while health concerns about phones use usually focus on the distraction they can cause while driving, the possible effects of radiofrequency exposure, or just how addictive they can be. The microbial infection risk of your phone is much less appreciated – but it’s very real.
A 2019 survey found that most people in the UK use their phones on the toilet. So it’s not surprising to discover studies have found our mobile phones to be dirtier that toilet seats.
We give our phones to children to play with (who aren’t exactly well known for their hygiene). We also eat while using our phones and put them down on all sorts of (dirty) surfaces. All of which can transfer microbes onto your phone along with food deposits for those microbes to eat.
It’s been estimated that people touch their phone hundreds if not thousands of times a day. And while many of us wash our hands regularly after say, going to the bathroom, cooking, cleaning, or gardening, we are much less likely to consider washing our hands after touching our phones. But given how disgusting and germ-infested phones can be, maybe it’s time to think more about mobile phone hygiene.
Germs, bacteria, viruses
Hands pick up bacteria and viruses all the time and are recognised as a route for acquiring infection. So too are the phones we touch. A number of studies conducted on the microbiological colonisation of mobile phones show that they can be contaminated with many different kinds of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
These include the diarrhoea-inducing E. coli (which, by the way, comes from human poo) and the skin-infecting Staphylococcus, as well as Actinobacteria, which can cause tuberculosis and diphtheria, Citrobacter, which can lead to painful urinary tract infections, and Enterococcus, which is known to cause meningitis. Klebsiella, Micrococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus have also been found on phones and all can have equally nasty effects on humans.
Research has found that many pathogens on phones are often antibiotic resistant, meaning they can’t be treated with conventional drugs. This is worrying as these bacteria can cause skin, gut and respiratory infections that can be life-threatening.
Research has also found that even if you clean your phone with antibacterial wipes or alcohol it can still be recolonised by microorganisms, indicating that sanitisation must be a regular process.

Phones contain plastic which can harbour and transmit viruses some of which (the common cold virus) can live on hard plastic surfaces for up to a week. Other viruses such as COVID-19, rotavirus (a highly infectious stomach bug that typically affects babies and young children), influenza and norovirus – which can cause serious respiratory and gut infections – can persist in an infectable form for several days.
Indeed, since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has introduced guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting mobile phones – which, along with door handles, cash machines and lift buttons, are considered reservoirs of infection.
In particular, concern has been raised about the role mobile phones can play in the spread of infectious microbes in hospital and healthcare settings, as well as in schools.
Clean your phone
So it’s clear that you need to start cleaning your phone regularly. The US Federal Communications Commission actually recommends daily sanitation of your phone and other devices – not least because we are still within an active COVID-19 pandemic and the virus can survive for several days on hard plastic surfaces.
Use alcohol-based wipes or sprays. They need to contain at least 70% alcohol to disinfect phone casings and touch screens, and it needs to be done every day if possible.
Do not spray sanitisers directly onto the phone and keep liquids away from connection points or other phone openings. Absolutely avoid using bleach or abrasive cleaners. And wash your hands thoroughly after you’ve finished cleaning.
Thinking about how you handle your phone will also help to avoid it becoming colonised with germs. When not at home, keep your phone in your pocket, or bag and use a disposable paper list of to-do items, rather than constantly consulting your phone. Touch your phone with clean hands – washed with soap and water or disinfected with alcohol-based hand sanitiser.
There are other things you can do to avoid your phone becoming a source of viruses. Do not share your phone with others if you have any infection, or have not first sanitised it. If children are allowed to play with your phone, sanitise it as soon as possible afterwards.
And get in the habit of putting your phone away when not in use, then sanitising or washing your hands. You might also want to occasionally sanitise your phone charger when you are cleaning your phone.",The dirty truth about your phone – and why you need to stop scrolling in the bathroom,science + tech
"Perhaps when you think of scientific research in Africa you think of the continent’s amazing natural resources, buried out of sight under soil or rocks. Or maybe your mind goes to its ancient history of human evolution.
But there’s another important, huge expanse that’s garnering attention among African researchers: the Universe. Planetary and space scientists study our solar system. They draw from the disciplines of astronomy, Earth sciences, geology, robotics and aerospace research, among others, to understand the Universe and humans’ place in it.
The study of planets and of outer space also helps to advance technology. Familiar consumer products such as GPS, LED lighting, wireless devices and even memory foam are all spinoff technologies from space research.
Research in this field offers a way to study Earth’s environment, atmosphere and climate through remote sensing and Earth observations such as satellite data. And it’s an opportunity to explore other planets for alternative natural and energy resources.
Some African countries, like South Africa, Morocco and Senegal, have already established themselves as major players in planetary and space science. There have beensome  pan-African attempts to develop and promote planetary and space science.
For the most part, though, planetary and space science doesn’t garner much interest beyond research scholars. Many Ghanaians, for example, don’t know about the country’s growing planetary and space science community. They may not know that Ghana is home to West Africa’s only planetarium, or that the region’s largest natural lake, Lake Bosumtwi, was formed in the crater caused by a meteorite striking Earth.
As a planetary scientist working and conducting research in Ghana, I think it’s time to get more people interested in this fascinating, important aspect of science – and to cement the country’s place as a major player in planetary and space science. This could also be a valuable way to develop Ghana’s knowledge economy, which developed nations have harnessed to drive their economic growth.
Education and outreach
The first step to growing interest in planetary and space science is through educational outreach. This consists of educational, entertaining programmes and activities in both informal and formal learning environments. Here, Ghana could learn from Senegal. The Senegalese Association for the Promotion of Astronomy has developed several successful projects, most notably the Spacebus.
The Spacebus is a caravan that promotes astronomy and scientific culture. It travels across Senegal, presenting exhibits and giving members of the public access to science kits and telescopes.
This could be replicated in Ghana. Space science and planetary researchers could also visit schools, conduct workshops and take part in career fairs to get young people interested in this sort of work. The Ghana Planetarium in the capital city, Accra, could play a key role here: it already organises events and activities centred on robotics and astronomy, among others.
There’s also the Ghana Radio Astronomical Observatory in Kuntunse, in the Greater Accra region. Its 32-metre telescope allows it to image distant space objects, as well as tracking satellites and spacecrafts. It is already an educational centre for the general public and this capacity could be developed.
Getting young people interested is important because Ghana needs more astronomers, astrophysicists, aerospace engineers, cosmochemists – and, for the especially adventurous, astronauts. These sorts of experts can boost the country’s scientific knowledge and output and this, in turn, can benefit Ghana economically through the development of the knowledge economy.
Read more: How the SKA telescope is boosting South Africa's knowledge economy
There is no data on the precise numbers of people working in these fields in Ghana, but in my own experience and based on how few planetary and space science-related institutions there are in the country, it is clear that more should be done to boost these professions’ ranks.
A unique site
Perhaps another way to get Ghanaians engaged is to show them how space and Earth sometimes interact. The country has one of the world’s best examples of this interaction, dating back more than a million years. Lake Bosumtwi is West Africa’s largest natural lake and Ghana’s only naturally occurring inland freshwater lake. Located about 25km south-east of Kumasi in the Ashanti region, it fills a 1.07 million year old meteorite impact crater.
Many impact craters around the world, including South Africa’s Vredefort Crater, are popular tourist attractions. People visit these sites to learn about Earth’s relationship with space, asteroids and meteorites. The same can be done with the Bosumtwi impact crater, making it a boon for Ghana’s tourism industry – and another way to get Ghanaians excited about planetary and space science.
Planetary and space science has become an integral part of the world’s development. Ghana has the opportunity to build on its existing facilities and to capture people’s imaginations so that the country can boost its contribution to global efforts.","Ghana needs more astronomers, astrophysicists, aerospace engineers and astronauts – how to develop them",science + tech
"DNA is the blueprint of life. All the information that an organism needs to survive, reproduce, adapt to environments or survive a disease is in its DNA.
That’s why genomics – studying DNA and genes – is so important. It involves sequencing species’ parts or the entire genome. This is a scientific method to determine an organism’s DNA by breaking these components into fragments and determining their compositions or sequences. The fragments are then aligned and merged to reconstruct the original sequence.
This arms researchers with critical information. They can learn how to treat or prevent diseases, for instance, or how to breed crops and animals with better traits. Those traits might help species adapt better to the environment (more crucial than ever in the era of climate change) or improve their yields, making them more profitable.
But there’s a large gap in genomics research: barely anything is known about the genomics of African species. This is despite the continent’s rich biological diversity. It has plants and animals that aren’t found anywhere else in the world.
These species have provided people across Africa with food, medicines and a way of life for centuries. For example, people in the continent’s dry regions have long kept indigenous cattle, sheep and goats. The animals are a source of food and income in places that cannot support crop production.
African species have been neglected by the global genomic community. Scientists tend to focus on their own regions or countries. Africa’s own genome sequencing and bioinformatics capacity is limited, so the continent’s scientists haven’t been able to do the necessary work. To date only a fraction of species endemic or indigenous to the continent have been properly sequenced and adequately characterised using other scientific methods.
The African BioGenome Project (AfricaBP) wants to change this. It’s a pan-African project that seeks to sequence Africa’s endemic and indigenous plants and animals. That’s an estimated 105,000 species. We are three of the more than 109 African scientists involved in the project and recently published a position paper in Nature outlining the consortium’s vision for the next 10 years.
The sequencing of the human genome, a US-led effort, shows how many direct and indirect benefits there are to this kind of work. The Human Genome Project led to advancements in genomics and precision medicine. It spurred new innovations in equipment, technologies and infrastructure that generated US$265 billion annually for the US economy by 2019.
AfricaBP also aims to attract more students and early career researchers to genomics and related fields – and to encourage them to stay on the continent so that African countries benefit from their skills. This process could be achieved by working with African institutions to provide permanent positions in genomics and bioinformatics.
A crucial investment
Genome sequencing is a complex process. Species must be sampled and collected from specific locations; processed and quality controlled; sequenced and then carefully studied.
AfricaBP works closely with its scientific communities and partners to select species for sequencing. We will be sending out several calls to scientists across Africa to nominate species. Some have already been selected: these include the Checkered Elephant Shrew (Rhynchocyon cirnei) in Central and South-East Africa and the red mangrove tree (Rhizophora mangle) in West Africa).

Researchers are asked to explain the species’ scientific, cultural and economic significance. We want the species we sequence to be useful to a particular community or communities, perhaps by providing food or medicine, or to be culturally significant. They could also be endangered, making their documentation through sequencing efforts even more urgent.
Read more: The Human Genome Project pieced together only 92% of the DNA – now scientists have finally filled in the remaining 8%
Some may raise their eyebrows at the project’s projected cost: about US$1 billion over the next 10 years to complete the planned sequencing, develop infrastructure and train more scientists. It might seem like an unjustified expense given Africa’s urgent needs, such as food security.
But genomics can help to address some of these needs. Providing nutritious food to an ever increasing human population will be made possible by new technologies that reduce breeding times and select for the traits that make crops hardy, adaptable and nutritious. For example, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas in Rabat, Morocco, screened 5,780 wild crops, like sugar beet and pea; it found that many of these can cope with major desertification. These crops’ genes could be transferred to related crops to help deal with arid conditions.
This sort of science has also been shown to drive economic growth through related fields such as biopharmaceuticals, diagnostics, new medical devices and through providing health care in new and innovative ways. The human genetics and genomics sector in the US has been found to support more than 850,000 jobs and contributed US$265 billion to the US economy.
Retaining African talent
African science stands to benefit from this initiative. There are already 109 African researchers involved in AfricaBP; most of them (87) are based at 22 institutions across the continent, in countries including Morocco, Nigeria, Cameroon, Kenya, and South Africa.
Developing better genomic infrastructure in African countries is a way to keep researchers on the continent, harnessing their skills for their own countries and regions. It is also crucial to get more African scientists involved in initiating home-grown research projects that focus on national priorities.
In the next decade we hope that AfricaBP will be part of efforts to prioritise genomic sequencing – and help reap its benefits for the continent.

"When large animals like elephants, giraffes and crocodiles roamed what is today South Africa’s Cape south coast hundreds of thousands of years ago, they were not alone. Far below their sight lines, tiny creatures like gerbils were forging their own paths across the landscape.
Like their larger counterparts, these small creatures left their marks. Their tracks were preserved in aeolianites – the cemented remains of dune surfaces – and cemented beach deposits.
In a recently published article in Quaternary Research we documented these minute gerbil tracks and traces. We also described an invertebrate trackway, which we attributed to a spider. This work is part of the Cape south coast ichnology project.
Since it started in 2008 our team has identified more than 300 vertebrate tracksites along a 350 km stretch of South Africa’s coastline. They date back to the Pleistocene epoch, ranging mostly from 140,000 to about 70,000 years in age. The spider trackway is the first belonging to an invertebrate that the team has described.
There is something near-miraculous in the concept of tiny creatures, weighing just grams, making tracks and traces so long ago, that are now evident in rock, and are recognisable and amenable to our interpretation.
Finding and describing them helps us to reconstruct an ancient environment. This can deepen our understanding of how the landscape has changed over time and how it might change in the coming years as the climate shifts.
A rare find
The sites we have documented as part of our project would have been situated at the margin of the vast Palaeo-Agulhas Plain, which was alternately exposed and inundated during Pleistocene sea-level oscillations. The fossil tracksites we study provide a census of which creatures trod on the area’s ancient dunes and beaches.
The stretch of coastal cliffs in which these sites were found contains a concentrated zone of tracksites. To date, 80 vertebrate track sites have been identified in this remote area alone.
Several of these have had important paleo-environmental implications – like revealing the previously undocumented presence of hatchling sea-turtles.
Read more: First fossil trails of baby sea turtles found in South Africa
It’s very unusual for small tracks to be preserved. Larger, heavier animals create larger, deeper tracks, which are easier to identify once Pleistocene palaeosurfaces are re-exposed. Dune and beach sands, being relatively coarse-grained, also do not provide ideal conditions for tracks to be registered and preserved. Good preservation is more likely in finer-grained silty sediments which are relatively rare in rocks along the Cape south coast.
Trackways of small mammals are extremely rare in the global fossil record, previously being known from only two Mesozoic sites (from the Jurassic Period in Patagonia about 165 million years ago) and three Cenozoic sites, from the Miocene Epoch about 15-20 million years ago in Colorado and Utah.
This makes our discovery of gerbil trackways especially exciting. The evidence for gerbils – probably the Cape gerbil, Gerbilliscus afra – included a trackway consisting of 12 pairs of tiny tracks in a typical bounding gait pattern (rather than a walking, running or hopping gait). We also found branching burrows and a characteristic structure resembling a debris mound that gerbils create at the entrance to their burrows and tunnels.
A tiny trail of tracks
Close by another site yielded a further unusual and exciting find: an arachnid trackway that extended for a distance of 25 cm. Extant spider groups in the region capable of making such traces include rain spiders and baboon spiders.
The spider trackway found by the research team. The scale bar is 10 cm. Charles Helm
Invertebrate trace fossils are common on Cape south coast Pleistocene palaeosurfaces. But the science of analysing, describing and considering their paleoenvironmental significance is in its infancy. The arachnid trackway illustrates the potential of this field for future study.
Sadly, these sites are ephemeral. Within weeks of being identified the gerbil debris mound had disintegrated. Within a year the gerbil trackway had been severely eroded by wind and water and the rock containing the arachnid trackway had slumped into the ocean. This serves as a reminder of the need for frequent coastal surveys, in particular after rockfall events and storm surges.
Nonetheless, these discoveries show that under favourable circumstances Pleistocene palaeosurfaces on the Cape south coast have the capacity to preserve fine detail made by tiny trackmakers, visible under optimal lighting conditions.",Tiny tracks tell of ancient paths made by gerbils and spiders on South Africa’s south coast,science + tech
"Weather forecasting is an important science. Accurate forecasting can help to save lives and minimise property damage. It’s also crucial for agriculture, allowing farmers to track when it’s best to plant or helping them protect their crops.
And it will only become more vital in the coming years. Severe weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense because of climate change and variability.
I am a meteorologist with specialities in forecasting weather and climate change – who wants to improve the quality of weather products and their applications to spur socioeconomic development across Africa. Doing so matters: the World Bank has pointed out that better weather forecasts can bolster the continent’s development.
So, how does forecasting work? What does it take to produce accurate, reliable and timely forecasts? And how can African countries do better on this front?
A complex process
Weather forecasting is complex and challenging. The process entails three steps: observation, analysis and communication.
For observation, forecasters work with atmospheric models. These are sets of equations that depict the state of the atmosphere. The models use information on the initial state (observations) of the atmosphere, land and ocean to forecast weather. Data from the models is combined with information drawn from weather stations which are set up at key points across a region or country to give the actual state of the atmosphere. This data assimilation produces a better forecast since it optimises forecasters’ understanding of the evolving weather system.
It’s easier to be accurate when giving a short-range forecast – one that covers hours to days – than it is when interpreting long-range (months or seasons) data. The atmospheric system is dynamic; the more time that passes, the less certain forecasters can be of its state.
Technological advances have greatly improved the general quality of weather forecasting. For instance, more observations are possible because of automated weather stations. There’s also been an increase in the use of high performance computing. This allows for more data storage, faster processing, analysis, and visualisation of incoming data.
These datasets are key in diagnosing past and current weather to create a forecast. Unfortunately, the data observation network (both manual and automated stations) is still poor, especially in developing countries. That’s the result of limited investment into the sector. Forecasters in these countries are forced to use alternative datasets that are not very accurate.
One such alternative dataset is Numerical Weather Prediction. It uses global deterministic models that are normally not detailed enough to realistically represent convection at a local or regional level; forecasters using this data often can’t accurately predict rainfall, especially heavy rain. A lack of access to better historical data also means forecasters struggle to identify when an area’s seasonal rainfall will start and end because they can’t examine trends over years or decades.
It’s these variations in access to data and technology that mean some forecasts are more accurate than others.
Once forecasts have been collated, they are released in various forms. The way that weather products – apps, TV and radio bulletins or website updates – are packaged will differ depending on end users’ needs. Some people, like farmers, may be especially interested in seasonal forecasts and will seek these out. Athletes, for example, are more likely to use portals or services that focus on hourly and daily forecasts.
I would recommend that, whoever you are, you consider seasonal forecasts general information for broad planning purposes. But this should be interpreted together with monthly, weekly and daily forecasts for accuracy’s sake.
Indigenous knowledge
Some African countries also use another kind of data for their forecasts: indigenous ecological knowledge. This entails drawing from communities’ long held knowledge about their environments, and especially about long-term trends and shifts. Such knowledge can be blended with scientific processes during forecasting.
Read more: How satellites are helping Africa improve weather forecasts
The “rainmakers” from the Nganyi community in western Kenya are a good example. These residents have deep historical knowledge about the area’s climate and weather patterns. They use plants and animals to understand what the weather is doing. They now work with meteorologists from Kenya’s Meteorological Department to produce seasonal weather forecasts.
A trailer for a documentary about the “rainmakers” of Nganyi.
Indigenous knowledge is under threat as the elders who are its custodians are perishing. Vital plants and animals used in their processes are going extinct, too. It would be a great pity if this resource were lost to forecasters. This knowledge plays an important role in local livelihoods and it supports efforts to forecast and make sense of seasonal climate state at local scale.
Changes coming
Some of the ways that weather is forecast today may change in the coming years. The World Meteorological Organisation is encouraging national meteorological services to move from what the weather will be (forecasting weather) to what the weather will do – impact based forecasting-and-warning.
There’s also a push to ensure forecasts reach the people who need them. A number of African countries, among them Malawi and Chad, have adopted what’s known as Participatory Scenario Planning. This collaborative approach designs and delivers user focused climate information services by taking the co-production process down to the sub-national level. It brings together producers and users of weather and climate information – meteorologists, indigenous knowledge experts, researchers, various sectors of local government, farmers, as well as NGOs and journalists.
Private firms that provide global weather forecasts are also emerging. This is commendable given that they supplement the services of countries with limited resources. But my advice is that, where the national meteorological and hydrological centres have capacity to produce weather forecasts, theirs should be considered first, ahead of those generated by private firms. This is because national bodies’ forecasts are based on the observed historical and observed data which they are custodians of rather than private institutions that rely mainly on model data.",The science of weather forecasting: what it takes and why it’s so hard to get right,science + tech
"The Nigeria-South Africa Bi-National Commission is a laudable idea. It was established in 1999 to strengthen the relationship between Nigeria and South Africa on trade, economy, politics and governance.
But it has one missing element. That is cooperation on space activities. Cooperation on space between the two countries would advance the efforts of the African Outer Space Programme.
The space programme is one of the priority areas of the Agenda 2063, the African Union’s framework for regional integration and socio-economic development.
African Heads of States and Governments adopted the African Space Policy and Strategy in 2016. The policy guides the implementation of the African Outer Space Programme. There is also the African Space Agency which was established in 2018 to coordinate space activities in the continent.
But the successful implementation of the AU’s space programme depends on cooperation between Nigeria and South Africa. They are the top two countries in the region in terms of economy, science and space.
Space cooperation between Nigeria and South Africa is not only advantageous on its own. It can be used to achieve other goals, including job creation for both Nigerians and South Africans through joint research.
There are four thematic areas which could underpin their cooperation. They are earth observation, satellite communication, navigation and positioning, as well as space science and astronomy.
Potential areas of cooperation
Earth Observation: This entails taking pictures of the Earth surface from an elevated platform. These are then analysed, interpreted, and the findings used for policy and decision making.
Among platforms that are used for taking these pictures are balloons, aircraft, High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs) and satellites. Of these, only satellites are the most stable.
Nigeria has three Earth Observation satellites - the NigeriaSat-1, NigeriaSat-2 and NigeriaSat-X.
These polar-orbting satellites would be more useful to South Africa because it is closer to the Antarctic. In addition, South Africa has the capability to process, analyse and interpret data.
Cooperation on space between the two nations would give South Africa access to images from these Nigerian satellites. Nigeria would, in turn, gain access to South Africa’s technical knowledge.
Nigeria and South Africa are among the four signatories to the African Resource Management Constellation. Signatories donate a satellite to the constellation, giving them access to data from other satellites. Of the four signatories (Algeria and Kenya being the other two), only Nigeria and South Africa have contributed satellites, though the satellites have passed their life-time. Nigeria-South Africa space cooperation could be a step towards reviving the initiative.
Each country would also benefit from the other’s networks. But this would require that Nigeria and South Africa have a working data access and sharing agreement. Nigeria is part of the disaster monitoring constellation (DMC), alongside Algeria, Turkey and the United Kingdom. South Africa is part of the BRICS remote sensing satellite constellation.
Satellite communication: This is used for long-distance communication and for connecting remote parts of a country. Satellite communication services in Nigeria and South Africa are mostly run by foreign companies.
In 2011, Nigeria procured from China a communication satellite, Nigcomsat-1R. The objective was to reduce communication costs and to increase rural connectivity.
South Africa is building its first communications satellite, but this is being delayed by funding.
South Africa could licence Nigcomsat Limited  to operate which could reduce the cost of communication services in South Africa.
Navigation and Positioning: The Global Navigation Satellite System is used in a number of applications, including precision agriculture, exact timing, and surveying.
The Chinese and the European Union are pushing for their navigation satellite services to be used across Africa. The EU has extended the operation of its Space-based augmentation system into Africa. China is advocating for the use of its Beidou system .
The interoperability and compatibility of these global navigation satellite systems hasn’t been resolved. This leaves the African continent at a risk of errors, inconsistencies or total loss of satellite navigation services.
Hence, there is an urgent need for African countries to cooperate, coordinate and harmonise satellite services. South Africa and Nigeria can take the lead.
Space Science and Astronomy: Astronomy is the study of objects and processes that occur outside the Earth’s atmosphere.
South Africa has several astronomical facilities. These include the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory; South African Large Telescope; South African Radio-Astronomy Observatory; South African Astronomical Observatory; and SANSA Space Science (formerly called Hermanus Magnetic Observatory).
The South African Astronomical Observatory’s optical telescopes at the Sutherland station have been upgraded. They can now be operated remotely from anywhere in the world via the Internet. Thus, astronomers in Nigeria can tap into the South African telescopes from their desktop computers.
They only need to negotiate observing slots with the South African Astronomical Observatory.
There is increasing interest in how the Sun affects the Earth and its environment, referred to as Space weather. This phenomenon can disrupt power supply and satellite navigation signals.
It is therefore mutually beneficial for Nigeria and South Africa to cooperate on space weather and atmospheric research. This will further their understanding of the solar weather phenomenon, predict its occurrence and then prepare for it.
Recommendations
To facilitate space cooperation, there are some immediate actions Nigeria and South Africa could take.
These include establishing a Nigeria-South Africa Space forum. This will serve as a platform for interaction and exchanges between professionals from both countries. An example of such is the U.S-Japan Space Forum.
The forum could advise governments on common positions, including policy issues such as long-term sustainability of outer space and spectrum management.
The cooperative agreement between Nigeria’s National Space Research and Development Agency and the South African National Space Agency should be strengthened.
Nigeria and South Africa could appoint experts on space as science attachés in their respective embassies. This would ensure speedy exchanges and necessary support for visiting professionals.
Nigeria and South Africa need to develop a comprehensive strategy for space knowledge and related workforce development. This includes a review of school curriculum as well as the training programmes of institutions dedicated to space education.",There’s a case for Nigeria and South Africa to cooperate on outer space activities,science + tech

What would happen if all the mosquitoes in the world disappeared? (Niko, 4, Diani in Kenya)
Most people in the world absolutely hate mosquitoes. Personally, I don’t mind them – they don’t really bite me, so they do not bother me that much. That is not the case for most people, who cannot stand the itchy bites and annoying noise mosquitoes make.
Because of the work I do on malaria, I even spend my time taking care of them and keeping them alive so my colleagues and I can research them. This is serious, important work because mosquitoes are more than just annoying: they are the most dangerous animals in the world. No other animals are responsible for more people’s deaths – mosquitoes spread a number of deadly diseases. So, would it not be better for the world if all these terrible animals just disappeared?
Curious Kids is a series by The Conversation that gives children the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskids@theconversation.com. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we’ll do our very best.
What are mosquitoes?
To be able to start answering the question, we need to understand what mosquitoes are. Mosquitoes are actually a large group of insects. They are flies, which means the adults look completely different to baby mosquitoes, known as larvae. The adults also have only two wings, unlike bees and wasps which have four. There are many different types of biting flies. All of them need to take blood from animals – including humans – to be able to lay eggs.
Even though there are many biting flies, such as horseflies and tsetse flies, mosquitoes are by far the most common and widespread.
What we call mosquitoes are actually 3,500 different types of insects, and they all behave differently. Most are active at night, but some are active during the day. People may not realise it, but only female mosquitoes bite us, because they need our blood so they can lay eggs. Male mosquitoes drink nectar – a sugary juice made by plants – to survive.

Why we need mosquitoes

If a female mosquito takes blood from someone who is infected with certain types of virus or with a parasitic disease such as malaria, she can spread the disease to someone she bites later. Of all these mosquito species, only the females of about 40 types are truly dangerous because they can pass on diseases that make people sick.
So, of all the mosquitoes in the world, there are very few that are really dangerous. The problem is that these few types of mosquitoes spread many dangerous diseases – like malaria. More than 200 million people, most of them here in Africa where you and I live, get the disease every year. If only the mosquitoes that caused malaria disappeared, more than 500,000 lives would be saved per year, most of them children who are younger than five.
If just these malaria-spreading mosquitoes disappeared, the world would be much healthier.
It may sound like it would be better for us all if mosquitoes disappeared. But that’s not the case, because mosquitoes serve an important purpose.
Food for animals
Different kinds of animals, including humans, form what we call ecosystems: we all need each other, in different ways, to survive. And even mosquitoes are needed in ecosystems.
There are billions of mosquitoes. That is a lot of insects that could be another animal’s supper. Now, we do not know of any animal that only eats mosquitoes, but there are lots of mosquitoes and they are easy to hunt, so many animals eat them. Baby mosquitoes live in water and are the favourite food of the mosquito fish. Frogs, dragonflies, ants, spiders, geckos and bats, and some other animals, also eat mosquitoes.
If all mosquitoes disappeared, many animals would have a lot less food. Imagine if all the rice in the world disappeared. Nobody eats only rice, but if rice disappeared tomorrow, a lot of people would have a lot less food.
Most mosquitoes do not bite humans (they get blood from other animals) and some types of mosquitoes don’t bite at all. Male mosquitoes can also help plants breed by pollinating, giving the plants the chance to spread and grow in different places. They do not do it as well as bees, but they are definitely important for some plants such as the Blunt-leaf orchid.
Other people have asked the same question you have, Niko, and scientists think that removing every single mosquito from the world wouldn’t have a bad overall effect on the environment. But none of us are sure what will happen to small ecosystems and whether these would be better off without mosquitoes.
There’s also the worry that if we got rid of all mosquitoes they could be replaced by something worse, like another biting insect that might cause more disease or bite more painfully.
The good news is that clever scientists are working very hard all over the world to figure out how we can deal with the mosquitoes that are dangerous for humans. We may not get rid of all the mosquitoes, but we can help protect humans from the ones that spread disease and make us sick.",Curious Kids: What would happen if all the mosquitoes in the world disappeared?,science + tech
"Rooibos tea is a uniquely South African product. The plant, Aspalathus linearis, grows mainly in the Cederberg area of the country’s Western Cape province. And it’s not just a tasty beverage. It is caffeine-free; research has proved that it has anti-inflammatory properties. It’s also been found to ease pain and reduce allergies. Rooibos is also good for heart health.
As our new study shows, rooibos tea – specifically unfermented or green rooibos – may also help to reduce anxiety. Our research found that this extract of the tea, prepared using ethanol rather than water, has anxiolytic properties. This means it prevents or lessens the degree of anxiety a person experiences.
We didn’t reach this conclusion by testing the tea on human subjects, though. There’s a huge variation in anxiety severity, so a study in humans would require too many participants to give us sufficient statistical power, and thus be too expensive.
Instead, we used zebrafish. The small, striped tropical fish may seem like an odd choice, until you realise that they are genetically quite similar to humans. For more than 80% of the genes known to cause disease in humans, similar genes are represented in zebrafish.
This fact prompted Stellenbosch University’s Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences to set up the Zebrafish Research Unit just more than a year ago. Several studies are under way involving advanced analytical pharmacology, toxicology, therapeutic target identification and drug discovery. This study is one of the first to stem from the laboratory.
A variety of data
My research group studies the connection between psychological stress and chronic inflammatory disease. This is especially important in South Africa: the South African Depression and Anxiety group estimates that many as one in six South Africans suffer from anxiety or depression. Furthermore, the current top 10 causes of death in South Africa, like TB, diabetes and respiratory disease, all have inflammation as a common characteristic.
Zebrafish are ideal for drug discovery especially in the context of neurological and inflammatory conditions. We are able to do thorough testing including not only behavioural assessment and seeing how specific treatments work, but also assessing the risks of overdosing and long-term use of potential treatments.
So, we set out to employ our zebrafish models to see whether rooibos might have any positive effects on anxiety. Most of our research is done at the early larval stage, when the zebrafish are not yet considered a sentient animal. It’s a more ethical way of using a live organism in research, as they cannot experience pain at that stage.
We immersed the 2mm-long zebrafish larvae in different concentrations of rooibos in a small dish. Essentially, they were swimming in tea; this is absorbed through their skin as well as through their gills, since their mouths are not yet open.

At different points, specialised equipment tracked their movement and this was used to construct behavioural patterns. Using a model of anxiety – which entails exposing the larvae to alternating bright light and darkness for short periods of time – we assessed whether the larvae swimming in rooibos were able to remain calm, by comparing their behaviour to that of unsupplemented larvae. Normally, in this model, the larvae would “freeze” in bright light, followed by hyperactivity during the periods of darkness. In our study, rooibos-treated larvae also froze, but did not exhibit the anxious hyperactivity.
Oxidative stress
We also performed a test using the live larvae’s behaviour to probe a specific mechanism: a “feel-good” neurotransmitter, GABA, whose signalling can be manipulated by either enhancing or blocking its receptor. If the receptor is blocked, the larvae exhibit a hyperactive seizure-like behaviour. In our study, rooibos was able to completely prevent this response – in fact, it showed similar results to an anti-epileptic drug known to work through GABA.
The behavioural tests were complemented by whole body analyses for oxidative stress and anti-oxidant activity, as well as some cell culture work using human cells. In these models, we showed that green rooibos was able to protect human neurons against oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress increases during life and is actually responsible for ageing, so a product that can protect the brain from oxidative stress, can essentially slow our ageing process. In a world where advances in medicine are allowing us to grow older, it is becoming more and more important to be able to prevent the brain from ageing.
Taken together, our data suggest that green rooibos tea could be considered as a functional brain food. The research suggests it may be a good option as a starting ingredient in the development of new nutraceuticals – pharmaceutical alternatives which claim physiological benefits.
The results of this study mean that we could have uncovered nature’s contribution to treating some of South Africa’s health problems. It shows that drinking green rooibos tea may have a calming effect if you suffer from anxiety.
Zebrafish in research
This certainly won’t be the last piece of research from our lab or others that use zebrafish in drug discovery. The fish, which originate in Malaysia, may be the new rodent in research. Apart from their genetic similarities to humans, when in their larval stage the fish are fairly transparent; that makes them great for microscopy.
Read more: How the zebrafish got its stripes
We have a couple of tanks where we breed with the adult stock. The fish can live up to three years in a laboratory, compared to about a year in nature (because of excellent care in the lab, but also the absence of natural predators).
In terms of future research, assessing these effects in humans is on the cards. We are also generating very promising results on rooibos in the context of inflammatory bowel syndrome, a chronic condition affecting approximately 10% of the global population and which is the most common co-morbidity to anxiety disorders.",Zebrafish research reveals green rooibos tea’s anxiety-busting properties,science + tech
"In 1928, microbiologist Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin was hailed as a scientific breakthrough. In the nearly 100 years since then, scientists have discovered numerous other antibiotics that have saved billions of lives.
However, bacteria have become increasingly resistant to these treatments. There are two reasons for this: the overuse and misuse of antibiotics by humans, and the introduction of antibiotics to agriculture.
During 2021’s World Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness Week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) repeated a warning it had issued before: antibiotic resistance is rising to dangerously high levels globally. Globally it is estimated that antibiotic-resistant bacteria kill between 700,000 and several million people every year.
Resistance to antibiotics leads to a situation in which previously treatable infections are becoming harder – and sometimes impossible – to treat. Without urgent action, the world is heading for a post-antibiotic era. Common bacterial infections could once again become frequent killers.
One way to address this crisis is to cut back on the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Some countries are doing this by banning the inclusion of antibiotics in animal feed as growth promoters. This is because when humans consume meat or chicken, we ingest not only the antibiotics added to animal feed, but also antibiotic resistant bacteria.
A 2018 joint report by the WHO, Food and Agriculture organisation and World Organisation for Animal Health found that only 42% of countries have limited their use as growth promoters. Most are in Europe; only a fraction of countries in Africa and the Americas have taken these steps. The agricultural sector desperately needs alternatives to maintain animal health without detrimental consequences to human health.
The term “antibiotic growth promoter” describes the administration of antibiotics at a low, sub therapeutic dose as a preventative measure. It’s not entirely clear why antibiotics influence livestock growth. However, research suggests that they possibly promote growth by depressing the growth of microbes that are toxic or that steal nutrients from the host, leading to increased nutrition utilisation and reducing the energy that must be invested in maintaining immune responses.
One alternative to this is the use of probiotics, rather than antibiotics, in animal feed. I am a microbiologist and have developed a probiotic for chickens. Most probiotics on the market are not developed for a specific host; ours is developed specifically for chickens and contains multiple bacterial strains, which each target different areas of the gut to strive for complete gut protection.
My research shows that the probiotic has numerous beneficial characteristics – both for chickens and the humans who will ultimately eat them. The probiotic decreases the presence of pathogens in the animal’s gut and can be used safely on a daily basis.
What are probiotics?
Probiotics are health-promoting bacteria that naturally occur in the intestine of any animal with a gut. They have a mutually beneficial relationship with the host. A large body of research has shown that probiotics may improve animal health and growth performance. They do so by modulating nutrition and digestion, changing the microbial composition in the intestine, and by stimulating the immune system.
Some probiotic strains also produce vitamins and regulate cholesterol blood levels. They also produce antioxidants – substances that protect your cells against free radicals – and regulate energy production.

A chicken’s intestine, like a human’s, is home to a complex microbial ecosystem, the microbiome. It consists of trillions of microorganisms living in symbiosis with the host. These interactions are important for development, health, nutrition, and digestion.
Changes in the microbiome composition can be disruptive and lead to the emergence of pathogenic (harmful) microorganisms. Probiotics can prevent these disturbances by inhibiting the growth of pathogens and restoring the microbiome composition to a natural state. Probiotics can also prime the immune system to recognise pathogens in the gut.

The author with some of his probiotic testers. Stellenbosch University
We developed a probiotic for chickens because they are the most farmed animal in the world. There are about 135 chickens for every cow, and three for every human.
The first step in developing a chicken probiotic was to obtain the guts of 25 free-ranging chickens. Free-range chickens were chosen rather than housing-reared birds because they are exposed to the environment and so acquire a natural gut microbiome. The guts were then mashed into a liquid and plated on several hundred Petri dishes. As you can imagine, the resulting smell made me very unpopular with my colleagues and I had to set up my lab in a separate room.
As soon as bacteria started growing, hundreds of different bacteria were isolated and identified to species level.
The isolates were then screened for various beneficial characteristics. These included ability to survive transit in the gut, ability to colonise the gut, production of enzymes that can assist with digestion, and production of antimicrobial compounds that can inhibit pathogens. After eight months, I identified six beneficial bacterial species. Over the next four years I tested the multi-strain probiotic’s safety and its ability to decrease the presence of pathogens in the gut of chickens.
We found that the multi-strain probiotic was safe, increased bird immune responsiveness, and was able to decrease pathogen levels in the gut.
Environmentally friendly alternatives
The resulting probiotic, ProbiGal™, is a water based probiotic additive administered in the animals’ drinking water. ProbiGal™ has been extensively tested in intensive rearing settings. It will be launched in South Africa after regulatory approval has been granted by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Thereafter, we plan to launch it in the US and Brazil, two of the world’s largest poultry producing countries.
Much more – including an outright global ban of antibiotics in animal feed – remains to be done. But products like these are one step in the right direction: an example of an environmentally friendly alternative that’s good for animals and humans.","Swapping probiotics for antibiotics: how it could be a game changer for chickens, and us",science + tech
"Des éléments de la garde présidentielle menés par le général Abdourahmane Tchiani ont renversé le président du Niger Mohamed Bazoum le 26 juillet 2023. En réaction, quelques jours plus tard, un certain nombre de ses partenaires ont suspendu leur aide à Niamey. La Communauté économique des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (Cedeao) et la Banque centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (Bceao) ont imposé un embargo économique et financier au pays. Quelques semaines plus tard, Niamey a annoncé qu'il réduisait son budget de 40 %. Enseignant-chercheur à l'Université Abdou Moumouni de Niamey, Amadou Ousmane étudie entre autres les questions de déficit budgétaire et de croissance économique en Afrique de l'Ouest, les déterminants de la croissance des dépenses de santé dans l’espace Cedeao. Il explique ici les raisons de cette réduction et les conséquences sur le pays.
Quelles sont les raisons de cette révision budgétaire ?
Le budget de l'Etat est constitué de deux principales parties. Le total des ressources permet d’effectuer le total des dépenses de l’Etat. La partie ressource est composée :
de l’ensemble des recettes fiscales de l’Etat (issues de la fiscalité directe et indirecte) du fait de l’exercice de sa souveraineté vis-à-vis du secteur privé;
des ressources issues de la participation contractuelle de l’État à l’économie du marché. Cette participation peut prendre la forme de vente de biens et services et de placements financiers ou la forme de modification du patrimoine public lorsque l’Etat a recours à l’emprunt (crédit bancaire ou émission de titres publics).
d'autres sources de financement (dons, emprunts, aide budgétaire des partenaires au développement etc.).
Depuis les événements du 26 juillet 2023, les principaux partenaires au développement du Niger ont décidé de suspendre leur aide ou appui budgétaire au pays. La conséquence de cette décision est qu’une partie importante constituant les ressources de l’État ne sera pas disponible pour le financement de son budget. Les ressources budgétaires ainsi projetées pour l’année 2023 s’élevant à 3.245,44 milliards de francs CFA contre 2.908,59 milliards dans la loi de finances 2022, soit une hausse de 11,58 % (1 franc CFA = 0,00167 USD).
S’agissant des ressources extérieures, elles sont constituées des appuis budgétaires, des aides aux projets et des emprunts obligataires. Leurs prévisions s’élèvent à 1.764,72 milliards de francs CFA contre 1.546,73 milliards en 2022.
Par conséquent, le gouvernement est obligé de voter une loi de finances rectificative pour constater la modification de la loi initiale en tenant compte de cette nouvelle réalité.
En résumé, les ressources provenant des partenaires au développement ont deux finalités : soit elles sont accordées sous forme d’aide budgétaire, soit sous forme de prêts dans le cadre de financement des infrastructures ou d'investissements dans le cadre de la réalisation des projets de développement.
Depuis le 26 juillet 2023, ces deux formes d’appui sont intégralement suspendues, ce qui qui justifie la nouvelle loi de finances rectificative en tenant compte de cette nouvelle donne.
Quelles sont les autres raisons ?
La deuxième raison qui peut expliquer cette mesure provient des conséquences de la fermeture des frontières nationales du pays avec les pays de la Cedeao, principalement avec le Bénin où se trouve le port par lequel passe la majorité des importations du Niger. Ce qui limite les transactions commerciales avec les Etats membres de cet espace. Ce manque à gagner impacte directement sur les prévisions des recettes fiscales du Niger.
Troisièmement, faut-il le rappeler, même en temps normal, l’exécution du budget est accompagnée au cours de l’année par plusieurs séances d’adjudication des bons ou obligations du trésor dans l’espace de l'Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine (Uemoa) par l’intermédiaire du marché monétaire.
Les sanctions économiques et financières imposées par ces trois institutions (Cedeao, Uemoa, Bceao) interdisent toutes transactions financières et économiques entre le Niger et les pays membres de ces organismes. Ce qui constitue une entrave sérieuse pour le gouvernement du Niger dans ses capacités à pouvoir financer de manière souveraine son budget. Et c'est ce qui justifie une fois de plus la révision de cette loi de finances initiale.
Cette analyse faite du côté des recettes de l’État peut être aussi reprise du côté de la dépense. Ainsi, dans une moindre mesure, parmi les conséquences des évènements du 26 juillet figurent la suspension de toutes les institutions de la République et la suspension de tous les fonctionnaires sous contrat dans les ministères et les autres administrations de l’État.
Quand on sait que toutes ces institutions travaillent avec des milliers de conseillers spéciaux et techniques en leur sein en dehors même de leur charge de fonctionnement, cette suspension peut être une source importante d’économie des dépenses pour le gouvernement. Mais l’impact social de cette décision semble limité par rapport au grand défi économique et financier au niveau national. D’où la nécessité de revoir une fois de plus la loi de finances initiale.

Quelles seront les implications de cette réduction ?
Dans cette situation, l’État ne peut pas honorer ses engagements à travers ses différentes fonctions économiques régaliennes. Ainsi, les principales implications sont :
l’arrêt de tous les projets d’investissement soutenus par un financement extérieur,
l’arrêt de certains projets de développement avec financement propre, mais nécessitant beaucoup de moyens financiers (dont le pays manque cruellement de nos jours). C’est le cas des travaux de voiries de Niamey lancés avant les évènements de juillet.
une sélection rigoureuse dans les différentes fonctions économiques de l’État dans le domaine de l’affectation ou de l’allocation des ressources, dans ses fonctions de redistribution des ressources et dans ses fonctions de stabilisation et de régulation de l'économie.
A son niveau, l’État va faire un tri entre ses différents types de dépenses (fonctionnement, redistribution, investissement) pour s’en tenir aux dépenses essentielles à la continuité du service public. Ce qui peut avoir une incidence sur le taux de croissance économique revu à la baisse.
Au niveau de la population, c’est surtout la hausse des prix des denrées alimentaires du fait du problème d’approvisionnement du pays en produits de premières nécessité qui peut faire basculer une grande partie des ménages dans la pauvreté, et susciter peut être un mécontentement généralisé de la population. Pour le moment, la population accepte cette situation avec beaucoup d'abnégation et semble prête à accompagner le Comité national pour la sauvegarde de la patrie (CNSP, mis en place par les militaires au pouvoir) dans sa nouvelle orientation du pays.
Au niveau de l’économie globale, cette situation va impacter négativement le développement des activités du pays. Les sociétés publiques comme privées, les entreprises de production, de redistribution ou de commercialisation seront très durement affectées, surtout avec la suspension de l’électricité par le Nigéria. Le manque à gagner sera considérable pour les différents acteurs économiques du pays.
Que faut-il faire pour aider le pays à se prémunir contre les conséquences de ces coupes budgétaires ?
Le Niger est le quatrième de l’espace Cedeao à se retrouver dans une situation de transition politique ces deux dernières années avec l’arrivée des militaires au pouvoir. Ainsi, très vite après l'événement du 26 juillet et les sanctions qui s'en sont suivies, les membres du CNSP se sont rendus dans ces pays (Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinée) pour échanger et demander certainement conseils et soutiens afin de tenir dans cette situation inextricable.
Pour se prémunir contre les conséquences de ces coupes budgétaires, le CNSP a créé, d’une part, le Fonds de solidarité pour la sauvegarde de la patrie (FSSP) pour recueillir les donations des citoyens nigériens, à l’image de ce qui a été fait au Mali.
D’autre part, le CNSP s’est tourné vers les autres pays amis du Niger et du peuple nigérien aussi bien dans la sous-région, en Afrique que dans le reste du monde pour solliciter un appui multiforme, mais surtout financier pour contrecarrer les sanctions qui lui sont imposées et surtout réussir son œuvre de redressement national.
Un autre sursis viendra, sans doute, du début de l’exportation du pétrole brut en raison de près de 90.000 barils par jour, ce qui va constituer certainement une alternative sûre pour le financement souverain des dépenses budgétaires de l’Etat dans les années à venir. En effet, le 1er novembre dernier, le Premier ministre Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine a présidé la cérémonie officielle de lancement de la mise en production du pétrole brut à Koulélé.
Dans son allocution, le Premier ministre disait que “ces ressources vont nous permettre de nous affranchir de certains types de défis que nous vivons”.",Baisse de 40 % du budget du Niger : ce qui va changer dans l'économie du pays,Null
"Dans quelle mesure l'investissement privé aide-t-il les pays en développement à réduire les conflits et la violence et à atteindre les Objectifs de développement durable ?
Cette question est très débattue. La plupart des institutions internationales, telles que le groupe de la Banque mondiale, estiment que le problème réside dans l'insuffisance de l'investissement privé. Elles mobilisent donc des ressources publiques pour subventionner et protéger les acteurs du secteur privé dans le but d'accroître considérablement les investissements étrangers directs.
Pendant ce temps, les défenseurs des communautés, du travail et des droits de l'homme - en particulier dans les pays fragiles et touchés par des conflits - ont plutôt tendance à considérer les modèles dominants d'investissement direct étranger comme faisant partie d'une histoire continue d'exploitation des pays en développement.
Pour contribuer à éclairer ce débat, nous avons entrepris une étude approfondie de milliers de projets de laSociété financière internationale(IFC), la branche du Groupe de la Banque mondiale qui s'occupe du secteur privé. Nous nous sommes concentrés sur la période allant de 1994 à 2022.
Nous avons choisi l'IFC parce qu'elle prétend investir pour atteindre le développement. Elle prétend également appliquer les normes les plus élevées en matière de performances sociales et environnementales. En outre, de nombreux autres acteurs privés et publics suivent son exemple en matière de définition des normes. Si l'IFC se trompe, ce serait un bon indicateur de la situation du système mondial au sens large. Nous avons axé notre étude sur la relation entre les projets de l'IFC et les conflits armés, car la violence a un effet négatif évident sur le développement humain.
Les résultats montrent que les projets de l'IFC sont à l'origine d'une augmentation significative des conflits armés dans le monde. Un seul projet provoque en moyenne 7,6 conflits armés supplémentaires dans l'année qui suit son lancement. Ces résultats sont en adéquation avec d'autres grandes études quantitatives qui remettent en question la relation entre l'investissement direct étranger et le développement. Les investissements directs étrangers qui accroissent les conflits violents et rendent le développement presque impossible semblent être la règle, et non l'exception.
Nous concluons que les approches actuelles de l'investissement étranger doivent être réexaminées de toute urgence, en mettant particulièrement l'accent sur le risque de conflit violent.
Notre méthodologie
De nombreux facteurs influencent les conflits violents, notamment l'histoire des relations entre les groupes et entre l'État et la société. L'étude a donc utilisé des analyses économétriques sophistiquées pour isoler l'impact de l'IFC.
Nous avons d'abord géolocalisé les projets de l'IFC et noté les années au cours desquelles ils ont été approuvés. Nous avons ensuite vérifié si les conflits armés avaient augmenté dans la région proche du projet de l'IFC au cours de l'année suivante. Nous avons identifié d'autres facteurs - tels que la présence de groupes politiquement exclus, le PIB, le type de régime ou la taille de la population - qui ont une incidence sur les conflits.
Dans l'analyse, nous avons pris soin de faire correspondre et de comparer une zone de projet de l'IFC avec les zones sans projet de l'IFC qui lui sont le plus similaires. Enfin, nous avons pris en compte et vérifié la possibilité que les conflits proliféraient déjà avant l'arrivée du projet de l'IFC. En excluant ces autres raisons qui peuvent expliquer les conflits, nous avons été en mesure d'établir des relations de cause à effet raisonnables.
Read more: Three priorities Africa's newbie on the World Bank board should focus on
Fait inquiétant, l'étude a révélé que l'augmentation des conflits armés était concentrée dans des projets que l'IFC avait indiqués aux parties prenantes locales et internationales comme présentant des risques environnementaux ou sociaux potentiels limités. Elle a affirmé que ces risques pouvaient être facilement pris en charge par des mesures d'atténuation. Ces mesures d'atténuation semblent être soit inefficaces, soit sous-utilisées. Par ailleurs, il est possible que l'IFC fait un mauvais classement des projets comportant des risques de conflit plus élevés et qu'il ne veut pas le reconnaître ou le rendre public.
Un exemple particulièrement troublant est la campagne de terreur contre les citoyens locaux menée par le gouvernement ougandais pour céder des terres à un client de l'IFC. L'IFC n'a toujours pas donné suite aux plaintes déposées par des activistes en 2019 pour violence sexiste et menaces de représailles et d'intimidation à l'encontre de l'un de ses partenaires de projet, Salala Rubber Corporation au Libéria.
L'étude a également démontré que les projets à forte intensité de capital (c'est-à-dire l'agro-industrie, le pétrole, le gaz, l'exploitation minière et les infrastructures) ont une plus grande propension à causer des perturbations socio-politiques et socio-économiques. Les régions qui reçoivent des projets à forte intensité de capital connaissent, en moyenne, un décès de plus dû à un conflit armé au cours de l'année suivante.
Pas au-dessus de la loi
Ces résultats ne devraient peut-être pas surprendre. Les organisations de la société civile concluent depuis longtemps que l'IFC donne la priorité à ses propres profits et intérêts commerciaux au détriment des “souffrances d'autrui” contribuant ainsi à “diversifier les instruments qui conduisent à l'extraction, la dépossession et au conflit”. En 2020, Human Rights Watch a décrit l'IFC comme “étant défaillante sur les recours aux abus commis dans le cadre de projets. Cette affirmation se fondait sur l'étude commanditée par le Groupe de la Banque mondiale lui-même.
Pourtant, la stratégie de l'IFC a consisté à se placer au-dessus de la loi. Elle continue de revendiquer l'immunité souveraine. Elle affirme qu'en tant qu'organisation internationale, elle ne devrait pas être responsable devant les tribunaux nationaux, même à l'égard des parties qu'elle reconnaît avoir lésées.
Elle maintient cette position en dépit des récents rapports faisant état de la complicité de l'IFC dans la dissimulation des abus sexuels commis sur des enfants afin de favoriser ses projets d'investissement.
Il est grand temps que les 186 gouvernements membres de l'IFC exigent la transparence, la responsabilité et la réparation des préjudices causés par l'institution et les acteurs du secteur privé qu'elle finance. D'autres parties prenantes peuvent également jouer un rôle. Les gouvernements qui ont peut-être naïvement compté sur le prestige de la Banque mondiale devraient remettre en question les avantages qu'on leur a dit pouvoir attendre des investissements de l'IFC. Les agences de notation qui classent les obligations de l'IFC comme positives d'un point de vue environnemental, social et de gouvernance devraient remettre en question les bases sur lesquelles ces notations sont faites.
Dans le même temps, peut-être devrait-on accorder plus de crédit aux récents appels du secrétaire général des Nations unies en faveur de la réforme du système financier mondial pour mieux soutenir la sécurité humaine et le développement humain.
Cela pourrait inclure des intermédiaires spécialisés entre l'IFC et des projets sensibles dans des endroits difficiles. Un contrôle local indépendant et renforcé semble nécessaire pour garantir des formes plus inclusives et responsables d'analyse contextuelle et de planification de l'atténuation des risques, de suivi et d'évaluation de l'impact du développement, de gestion proactive des conflits et de réparation accessible pour les préjudices subis. Cela pourrait réduire les conflits violents et permettre davange de tirer parti du potentiel de développement de l'investissement privé dans les pays en développement.",Les projets financés par la branche du secteur privé du Groupe de la Banque mondiale alimentent les conflits armés : il est temps de réformer le système,Null
"Les élections en République démocratique du Congo sont prévues le 20 décembre 2023. La commission électorale du pays a annoncé que le président Félix Tshisekedi se représenterait aux côtés de 23 autres candidats. Parmi eux figurent le lauréat du prix Nobel de la paix Denis Mukwege et le candidat arrivé deuxième à l'élection présidentielle de 2018, Martin Fayulu. Les tribunaux confirmeront la liste finale des candidats. Une personnalité politique clé n'a pas encore fait connaître ses intentions : Joseph Kabila. Il a été président pendant 18 ans, jusqu'à ce que Tshisekedi prenne le relais en 2019. La Constitution de la RDC prévoit deux mandats de cinq ans, mais il est resté au pouvoir en retardant les élections. Il exerce une influence considérable sur les plans politique, militaire et économique. Jonathan R. Beloff est un politologue qui étudie la politique et la sécurité de la République démocratique du Congo, du Rwanda, du Burundi et de l'Ouganda. Nous lui avons posé quelques questions.
Quelle est la place de la famille Kabila dans la politique de la RDC ?
Joseph Kabila a été le quatrième président du pays. Il a pris ses fonctions après l'assassinat de son père, Laurent Kabila, qui a été tué par son garde du corps en 2001. Joseph a ensuite remporté les élections présidentielles de 2006 et de 2011.
L'élection surprise de Félix Tshisekedi en 2018, qui a pris le pouvoir en janvier 2019, a interrompu plus de deux décennies de règne de la famille Kabila. À l'époque, la Constitution interdisait à Joseph de se présenter à l'élection présidentielle - et il avait déjà dépassé son deuxième mandat de plus de trois ans.
La famille Kabila est devenue une puissance politique après avoir pris le contrôle du pays en 1996. Avec l’aide d'autres pays, tels que les voisins ougandais, angolais et rwandais, l'Alliance des forces démocratiques pour la libération du Congo, sous la direction de Laurent Kabila, a renversé le dictateur zaïrois de longue date, Mobutu Sese Seko. C'était pendant la première guerre du Congo (1996-1997).
Le mandat de Laurent a été marqué par l'inefficacité et la corruption. En moins de deux ans, il a renvoyé son ministre de la Défense, le Rwandais James Kabarebe, et commencé à armer les forces anti-rwandaises. Ces forces comprenaient des acteurs ayant participé au génocide de 1994 contre les Tutsi au Rwanda.
Laurent prétendait que son gouvernement soutenait ces forces uniquement après que la tentative du Rwanda de renverser son régime.
La sanglante deuxième guerre du Congo (1998 - 2003) a fait au moins deux millions de morts, dont la plupart étaient dus à la maladie et à l'extrême pauvreté plutôt qu'à la guerre elle-même. Bien que la tentative d'invasion de la capitale Kinshasa par Kabarebe en 1998 ait échoué, la vaste RDC a été divisée en sphères d'influence pour différentes nations et leurs groupes rebelles alignés. Ce statu quo n'a commencé à se briser qu'après l'assassinat de Laurent, qui a conduit à l'ascension de son fils Joseph.
Joseph a appris la stratégie militaire, les tactiques et la politique auprès de Kabarebe. Les deux hommes ont travaillé ensemble après la deuxième guerre du Congo pour débusquer de nombreuses forces anti-rwandaises. Il s'agissait notamment des Forces démocratiques pour la libération du Rwanda. Ils ont également fait campagne ensemble lors de l'élection présidentielle de 2011, que Joseph a remportée.
Joseph s'est d'abord présenté comme un réformateur qui mettrait fin à la deuxième guerre du Congo et poursuivrait des politiques visant à stimuler le développement politique et économique. Cependant, l'instabilité dans l'est du Congo a persisté sous son règne, avec des accusations de corruption massive qui a sapé le développement de la nation.
Quelle est l'influence de Joseph Kabila aujourd'hui ?
Joseph Kabila est toujours fortement présent au sein des institutions politiques, économiques et militaires du Congo. Il dispose de réseaux solides développés au cours de 18 ans au pouvoir. Il pourrait utiliser cette influence pour faire basculer le vote en faveur de l'un ou l'autre des candidats.
Son influence découle des alliances commerciales et politiques favorables qu'il a créées lorsqu'il était président. Comme Mobutu, Kabila a utilisé ses vastes ressources financières pour s'assurer des relations favorables avec des chefs d'entreprise congolais et étrangers. Une fuite de documents en 2021 a révélé que Kabila avait reçu plus de 138 millions de dollars US provenant de la corruption et de pots-de-vin. Il y avait des allégations selon lesquelles, l'ancien président avait dans un premier temps convaincu Tshisekedi d'accepter un accord de partage du pouvoir. Selon cet accord, Tshisekedi serait président, tandis que Kabila contrôlerait les décisions politiques en coulisses. La quasi nomination de Ronsard Malonda au poste de président de l'organe électoral illustre l'influence politique de Kabila. Malonda a occupé des postes à responsabilité lors des élections de 2006, 2011 et 2018. Il a été accusé d'avoir truqué les résultats en faveur de Kabila.
Ces accusations ont profité à la campagne électorale de Tshisekedi. Il s'est présenté comme un candidat qui n'est pas lié à la corruption en RDC.
Si Kabila décide de faire campagne, la dynamique politique au sein d'une grande partie de la société civile, de l'armée et de l'économie congolaise sera divisée. Les ministres et les fonctionnaires du gouvernement seront contraints de choisir de soutenir soit le président sortant, soit le candidat préféré de Kabila.
Qu'est-ce que Tshisekedi était censé changer après avoir mis Joseph Kabila en déroute ?
Il y avait au départ l'espoir que le gouvernement de Tshisekedi favoriserait la paix dans l'est du Congo, établirait une plus grande unité nationale et aiderait à résoudre les problèmes économiques du pays après des décennies de corruption et de conflit. Cependant, ces problèmes ont persisté.
Initialement, Amnesty International a salué Tshisekedi pour avoir gracié des prisonniers politiques et permis une plus grande ouverture de l'espace public pour les critiques du gouvernement congolais.
Il a également entamé des enquêtes sur les transactions minières passées sous les gouvernements de Kabila. En tant que président de l'Union africaine de 2021 à 2022, il a plaidé en faveur d'une plus grande attention à la pandémie de COVID-19 et a promu la zone de libre-échange continentale africaine.
Malgré les tentatives initiales de promouvoir des relations plus significatives avec le Rwanda, les relations se sont détériorées en 2022. Cela s'est produit après que le gouvernement congolais a accusé le Rwanda de soutenir les rebelles du M23.
Le Rwanda a nié ces allégations. Il a également accusé le gouvernement de Tshisekedi d'être hostile à la population tutsi congolaise – les Banyamulenge – qui sont historiquement liés aux Rwandais.
Le département d'État américain a exprimé son inquiétude quant à la rhétorique anti-Banyamulenge de Tshisekedi, ainsi qu'au caractère démocratique et transparent des prochaines élections.
La stratégie de campagne de Tshisekedi semble se concentrer sur la promotion de la sécurité dans l'est de la RDC, non seulement en battant le M23, mais aussi en attaquant le Rwanda pour son ingérence dans les affaires congolaises. Cette approche sécuritaire de la question des Banyamulenge et du Rwanda - la manipulation politique pour attiser la peur du public - a contribué à désamorcer les critiques internes du régime de Tshisekedi.
La tenue des élections est autre source de préoccupation. Certains craignent que Tshisekedi retarde ou annule les élections en invoquant des problèmes de sécurité. Si cela se produit, cela pourrait être perçu par les partenaires nationaux et internationaux comme une ingérence politique du régime au pouvoir.",Elections en RDC : l'héritage de la famille Kabila pèse sur le scrutin,Null
"Initialement prévue le 9 novembre 2023, l’élection présidentielle à Madagascar a été reportée au 16 novembre à cause d’une blessure qui a handicapé l'un des candidats. Treize candidats sont en lice, dont le président sortant, Andry Rajoelina, qui a dû démissionner conformément aux dispositions de la Constitution.
Onze (mais finalement dix) d'entre eux, regroupés sous le nom de “Collectif des candidats”, contestent le déroulement du processus électoral. Ils exigent la disqualification d'Andry Rajoelina en tant que candidat en raison de sa nationalité française qui aurait entraîné la perte de sa nationalité malgache. Ils exigent aussi le remaniement (sinon le remplacement) de l'actuelle Commission électorale nationale indépendante (Ceni), de la Haute cour constitutionnelle (HCC) et du gouvernement collégial dirigé par le Premier ministre Christian Ntsay. Ils sont en effet convaincus que ces institutions sont biaisées et soutiennent officieusement la candidature de Rajoelina.
Enfin et surtout, ils demandent une négociation (une “discussion sur table ronde”, comme ils disent) pour résoudre le conflit et répondre à leurs demandes. Pour le moment, la Fédération des églises chrétiennes (FFKM) et la présidente de l'Assemblée nationale, Christine Razanamahasoa, essayent d'offrir en vain leur médiation.
Je suis un enseignant-chercheur en science politique. J'ai étudié la politique malgache pendant plusieurs années, en me focalisant sur le processus de démocratisation, les conflits et transitions politiques. Je pense que cette élection présidentielle est cruciale pour l'avenir du pays, et il convient d'analyser les stratégies et les risques pris par chacun des candidats.
Les revendications de l'opposition
L'analyse des revendications du “Collectif des dix candidats” suggère qu'il est impossible de les satisfaire compte tenu du contexte actuel. D'une part, forcer Andry Rajoelina à participer à une négociation qui pourrait aboutir à sa propre disqualification en tant que candidat est tout à fait inconcevable. D'ailleurs, il a été révélé dernièrement qu'au moins deux autres candidats ont aussi une double nationalité franco-malgache : Jean Jacques Ratsietison et Sendrison Raderanirina.
Deuxièmement, l’actuel gouvernement collégial, la Ceni et la HCC n’accepteront jamais de cautionner une telle négociation, ni de se dissoudre et de céder le pouvoir à un nouveau gouvernement de consensus, à de nouvelles Ceni et HCC rebaptisée “Cour électorale spéciale” comme en 2013. La satisfaction de ces revendications suppose qu'une nouvelle crise politique grave ou guerre civile survient. Ce qui pourrait justifier une implication de la communauté internationale, en particulier des institutions régionales telles que la Communauté de développement de l'Afrique australe (SADC) et l’Union africaine, pour faciliter une transition similaire à celle de 2009 à 2013 afin de résoudre le conflit et sortir le pays de la crise politique.
Le Collectif des candidats a entamé ses manifestations de rue le 2 octobre 2023. Il entend les poursuivre jusqu'à ce que ses revendications soient satisfaites.
Cependant, de leur côté, Andry Rajoelina et deux autres candidats, Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko et Sendrison Raderanirina, ont lancé leur campagne électorale. Bien que les manifestations du Collectif soient généralement pacifiques, dès le début, les autorités locales et nationales ont recouru à des moyens sévères (particulièrement, l’utilisation à outrance des gaz lacrymogènes) et à des arrestations pour les réprimer.
Une situation volatile
Dès lors, la question qui se pose à l'heure actuelle est de savoir si l'élection présidentielle aura lieu, comme prévu, au 16 novembre. Jusqu’à maintenant, rien n’est sûr car la situation est très volatile et la tension entre les deux camps risque de dégénérer à tout moment, surtout à l’approche de la date fatidique. Malgré tout, une chose est sûre : le gouvernement en place, la Ceni et la HCC, qui soutiennent dans une certaine mesure leur ancien patron, Andry Rajoelina, sont déterminés à ce que l’élection présidentielle se tienne à la date prévue. Reste à savoir alors s’ils réussiront dans cette entreprise.
Une autre question qui mérite d’être examinée est de savoir si une élection, qui risque de se dérouler dans un contexte de manifestations massives de rue et peut-être de violences, sera considérée comme “libre, équitable et acceptée par tous”. Cela dépendra des évaluations des différents observateurs électoraux et surtout des partenaires financiers dont le pays dépend pour sa survie économique. Plusieurs organisations de la société civile et la SADC ont déjà annoncé leur participation en tant qu'observateurs.
D'autres organisations nationales et internationales sont aussi attendues. De plus, la plupart des partenaires financiers ont contribué aux fonds de financement de l’ élection.
Pourtant, cette élection comporte des risques importants aussi bien pour Andry Rajoelina et son équipe que pour les membres du Collectif des candidats. Pour les premiers, s’ils s’entêtent à organiser l’élection dans de telles conditions, sans essayer de diminuer la tension, ils risquent de faire face à un durcissement du mouvement de l’opposition et éventuellement à une guerre fratricide. De plus, même s’ils réussissent à tenir l’élection dans ces conditions, ils pourraient finalement aboutir à des résultats qui ne seront reconnus ni au niveau national, ni à l’échelle internationale. Dans ce cas, le scénario de 2009 pourrait encore réapparaitre.
Pour les membres du Collectif des candidats, le risque le plus apparent serait de perdre l’élection sans y participer, c’est-à-dire que ses membres se seront disqualifiés eux-mêmes au lieu de disqualifier Andry Rajoelina.
Le Collectif et ses partisans doivent être convaincus de la légitimité de leurs revendications pour risquer leur santé, leur liberté, et même leur vie dans les manifestations de rue. Ils doivent aussi avoir à leur disposition les moyens (matériels, financiers, et autres) nécessaires pour faire face à un gouvernement déterminé à tout faire pour tenir l’élection.
En définitive, les risques sont énormes pour toutes les parties impliquées. Il est important de peser attentivement les actions de chaque camp dans cette situation tendue. La stabilité politique et sociale du pays et son avenir dépendent, en grade partie, de la manière dont ces défis seront relevés.",Élection présidentielle de Madagascar : comprendre les stratégies et risques pris par les candidats,Null
"Le président du Kenya, William Ruto, a récemment annoncé que les frontières du Kenya seraient ouvertes aux visiteurs de toute l'Afrique, sans visa, d'ici à la fin de 2023. Il a déclaré
Lorsque les gens ne peuvent pas voyager, les hommes d'affaires ne peuvent pas voyager, les entrepreneurs ne peuvent pas voyager, nous devenons tous des perdants nets.
Quelques jours plus tard, le président rwandais Paul Kagame lui a emboîté le pas, déclarant que tous les Africains pourraient entrer au Rwanda sans visa.
Ni le Kenya ni le Rwanda ne seront les premiers. Fin 2022, le Bénin, la Gambie et les Seychelles avaient déjà mis en place un système d'accès sans visa pour tous les Africains. D'autres suivront peut-être bientôt. Certaines régions, certains blocs sous-régionaux et certains accords bilatéraux ont également mis en place un accès sans visa et même sans passeport dans certains cas.
Au sein de la Communauté d'Afrique de l'Est, l'Ouganda, le Rwanda et le Kenya autorisent les voyages transfrontaliers sans passeport. Le Botswana et la Namibie ont récemment signé un accord similaire.
Malgré ces progrès, vers la fin 2022, seulement 27 % des routes africaines permettaient aux Africains de voyager sans visa.
Des actions telles que celles du Kenya et du Rwanda permettent à l'Union africaine d'aller plus loin. La régularisation de la libre circulation des personnes à travers les frontières africaines est l'un des grands défis de développement du continent. C'est l'un des projets phares de l'Agenda 2063 de l'Union africaine.
Mais même si tous les pays africains n'exigeaient plus de visas pour les Africains, cela ne donnerait pas nécessairement aux visiteurs le droit de postuler à un emploi, d'établir une entreprise ou de construire une maison dans le pays d'accueil. Le protocole de 2018 sur la libre circulation des personnes de l'Union africaine vise la libre circulation totale, en trois phases : l'entrée, la résidence et l'établissement. Cela inclut tous les droits économiques complets, y compris en matière d'emploi. Il n'a toutefois pas été largement ratifié.
Notre nouvelle étude sur les tendances migratoires souligne la contribution potentielle des migrations au développement économique des pays d'origine et de destination. Cette contribution se concrétise par le transfert de compétences, de connaissances et d'envois de fonds. L'étude montre également que les migrations intra-africaines sont solidement ancrées dans des liens géographiques, sociaux et économiques. Les mouvements se font principalement à l'intérieur des régions et modérément entre elles.
Libre-échange et circulation des personnes
Les politiques de l'Union africaine soutiennent la libéralisation du commerce intracontinental, des investissements et de la circulation des personnes afin de promouvoir le développement économique, social et politique du continent. Le continent a progressé sur les aspects de l'Accord de libre-échange continental africain qui traitent du commerce et de l'investissement. Il n'y a pas eu beaucoup de progrès en ce qui concerne la libre circulation des personnes. Pourtant, la réussite de l'accord commercial passe par une plus grande liberté de circulation des personnes.
Cette interdépendance entre le commerce et la libre circulation des personnes a été au centre du récent Forum panafricain sur les migrations qui s'est tenu à Gaborone, la capitale du Botswana. Ce forum réunit les États membres de l'Union africaine, les communautés économiques régionales du continent, les agences des Nations unies et les organisations intergouvernementales pour délibérer sur les questions de migration et de mobilité humaine en Afrique.

La conférence a noté que la plupart des pays africains n'avaient pas ratifié le protocole sur la libre circulation des personnesde l'Union africaine. Dans le même temps, des améliorations ont été constatées dans les politiques et les pratiques aux niveaux national, bilatéral et multilatéral, qui facilitent la libre circulation des Africains.
Outre les annonces récentes du Rwanda et du Kenya, on peut citer d'autres exemples avec de plus en plus d'accords réciproques entre les pays.
La migration régionale, une norme
L'histoire des Etats africains avec des liens sociaux forts au-delà des frontières nationales, fait de la mobilité régionale une norme plutôt qu'une exception. C'est ce qui ressort des itinéraires de migration, qui se trouvent pour la plupart dans les mêmes régions et qui se déroulent dans les deux sens.
Par exemple, l'itinéraire du Burkina Faso vers la Côte d'Ivoire est la plus grande route migratoire du continent et au sein de la Communauté économique de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (Cedeao) - le bloc économique de 15 États d'Afrique de l'Ouest. La Côte d'Ivoire vers le Burkina Faso est tout aussi populaire. Cette tendance est omniprésente sur l'ensemble du continent, sauf dans la région de la Communauté de développement de l'Afrique australe, où la plupart des routes migratoires tendent à mener à l'Afrique du Sud.
Parmi les principales communautés économiques régionales, c'est la Cedeao qui connaît les migrations régionales les plus intenses. Elle est suivie par la Communauté de développement de l'Afrique australe et la Communauté de l'Afrique de l'Est. En revanche, la Cedeao est celle qui enregistre le moins de migrations interrégionales, tandis que la Communauté de l'Afrique de l'Est est celle qui en enregistre le plus.
Les différences de développement en Afrique signifient que certains pays connaissent des schémas contrastés, en particulier en ce qui concerne les migrations extracontinentales. Alors que la plupart des migrants africains migrent vers et depuis d'autres parties du continent, l'émigration extra-continentale est plus importante dans les pays à revenu intermédiaire tels que l'Afrique du Sud, le Kenya et le Nigéria.
L'immigration et l'émigration sont généralement faibles dans les pays à faible revenu et plus élevées dans les pays à revenu intermédiaire. Dans les pays riches, les gens ont tendance à ne pas émigrer. Le niveau relativement faible des migrations en Afrique suit cette tendance.
Seuls 14 % du total des émigrants dans le monde viennent d'Afrique. La densité moyenne des migrants, ou le pourcentage de migrants vivant sur le continent, est de 1,89 %, contre une moyenne mondiale de 3,6 %, l'Europe et l'Amérique du Nord se situant respectivement à 12 % et 16 %. La migration africaine est donc non seulement faible par rapport aux moyennes mondiales, mais elle présente également des caractéristiques de faible revenu.
Les pays à revenu élevé ont tendance à avoir plus d'immigrants que d'émigrants. L'inverse est vrai pour les régions à faible revenu. L'Afrique dans son ensemble compte plus d'émigrants que d'immigrants, ce qui confirme le lien entre migration et développement.
Les restrictions légales importent peu
Une grande partie des migrations en Afrique est insensibles aux restrictions juridiques ou aux définitions des frontières nationales, et même aux contraintes logistiques. Les diktats gouvernementaux parviennent à rendre une grande partie de cette migration irrégulière, mais ne parviennent pas à l'arrêter. Bien que l'intégration régionale et la libéralisation des règles de migration soient utiles, elles ne résolvent pas encore ce problème.
Le principal pays d'origine des migrants vers le Kenya est la Somalie, bien qu'elle ne fasse pas partie de la même communauté économique régionale. Et malgré les efforts du gouvernement kenyan pour dissuader les migrants somaliens de venir au Kenya. Le principal pays de destination des émigrants nigérians en Afrique est le Cameroun, bien qu'il n'appartienne pas à la Cedeao.
Si les réformes de la gouvernance des migrations en Afrique font des progrès considérables, il faudra encore du temps avant qu'elles ne rattrapent leur retard et soient capables de traiter de manière équitable et rationnelle la réalité des schémas migratoires en Afrique.

"“Comment se fait-il que nous n'ayons jamais entendu parler de ce magnifique instrument jusqu'à présent?” C'est ce qu'a récemment posté un étudiant de première année sur le forum de discussion de mon cours de musique du monde. Il a exprimé ce que beaucoup de ses camarades ont probablement ressenti après avoir regardé l'extraordinaire documentaire Ballaké Sissoko, Kora Tales.
Le film suit Sissoko, un musicien de classe mondiale, depuis sa maison à Bamako, au Mali, jusqu'à un puits sacré et un baobab en Gambie, sur la côte atlantique. Dans ce film, le primé Sissoko revisite le pays de son enfance et retrace les origines de l'instrument qui est devenu son destin.
Sissoko est un djeli (appelé griot par les étrangers), un musicien et historien oral héréditaire attaché à la classe dirigeante. Comme les générations qui l'ont précédé, il joue de la kora, une sorte de harpe unique originaire de la savane d'Afrique de l'Ouest. Elle comporte 21 cordes et se joue avec quatre doigts. Elle peut créer des textures musicales denses et éblouissantes, ainsi que de minces placages chatoyants qui accompagnent la transmission d'une histoire orale profonde. C'est l'un des instruments de musique artisanaux les plus sophistiqués au monde, tant par ses capacités musicales que par la profondeur de sa tradition.
Ballaké Sissoko : Kora Tales est un film magnifiquement réalisé qui devrait être vu par tous ceux qui s'intéressent à la culture et à l'histoire africaines.
L'expansion mondiale de la kora
Si vous n'avez jamais entendu parler de la kora, ce n'est pas par manque de visibilité. Des dizaines et des dizaines d'albums de kora ont été publiés depuis le premier album solo du Gambien Jali Nyama Suso en 1972. La kora a remporté plus de Grammy Awards dans la catégorie “World/Global Music” que le sitar. Un album mettant en scène la kora avec le BBC Symphonic Orchestra est sorti en 2023. La portée de la kora au-delà de l'Afrique de l'Ouest est vaste. On peut l'entendre sur des enregistrements réalisés par des musiciens du monde entier.
J'ai entendu la kora pour la première fois sur un album de 1973 du Gambien Alhaji Bai Konte. C'est une expérience formatrice précoce qui m'a mis sur la voie de l'ethnomusicologie. Dans les années 1980, le joueur de kora sénégalo-américain Djimo Kouyate m'a incité à étudier les variations régionales sur la manière de jouer la kora dans quatre pays voisins. Je me suis retrouvé à Bamako, à trois portes de Ballaké Sissoko, et j'ai étudié avec Sidiki Diabaté (père de Toumani), qui habitait deux portes plus loin. C'est ce qui a servi de base à mon premier livre en 2000, Mande Music.
L'histoire
Construite à partir d'une grande demi-calebasse, d'une peau de vache, d'un manche en bois épais et de cordes et boucles d'accord en cuir (aujourd'hui en nylon), la kora est vieille de plusieurs siècles. Les précurseurs remontent à bien plus loin.

Elle est intimement liée à l'histoire du Mandé, patrie située le long du fleuve Niger, qui traverse le Mali et la Guinée d'aujourd'hui. Cette chefferie est montée en puissance dans les années 1200 lorsque le légendaire Soundjata Keïta a conquis un roi oppresseur, Soumaoro Kanté, avec l'aide d'alliés voisins. Kanté possédait le bala primitif (également appelé balafon), un xylophone magique, qui a été transmis au djeli (griot) de Soundjata. Il s'appelait Balla Fasséké Kouyaté et ses ancêtres gardaient cet instrument dans une case du nord-est de la Guinée.
En 2008, l'Unesco a déclaré l'instrument site du patrimoine culturel immatériel et aujourd'hui un musée est en cours de construction sur le site. À son apogée, l'empire mandé s'étendait sur une grande partie de l'Afrique occidentale et ses mines fournissaient la majeure partie de l'or circulant en Europe. Une visite à la Mecque du roi du Mandé Mansa Moussa dans les années 1300 a confirmé sa réputation de personne la plus riche dans l'histoire du monde. Les migrations vers l'ouest, dans la région de la Sénégambie, ont conduit au développement d'une langue et d'une culture apparentées, le mandingue.
Sissoko chez lui avec sa mère Luntandi Sakiliba à Bamako, au Mali. Screengrab/Ballaké Sissoko : Kora Tales/Vimeo
Tout comme le bala (xylophone mandé) trouve ses origines au Mali dans les années 1200, la kora trouve les siennes dans la fédération Kaabu des Mandingues de Sénégambie dans les années 1700. Traditionnellement, les djelis ont le droit exclusif de jouer de ces deux instruments. De nombreux récits sur l'origine des instruments de musique en Afrique font référence à un djinn (génie) qui l'aurait fait apparaître pour la première fois. Il en va de même pour la kora.
Le sujet du film
L'une de mes répliques préférées du documentaire est celle de la tante de Sissoko, Kadiatou Diabaté, elle-même djeli :
Cette personne devant vous est née avec la kora. La septième génération de sa lignée. Il suffit de le toucher pour que le son d'une des cordes jaillisse.
En voiture, Sissoko quitte Bamako, sa capitale, pour un voyage de plus de 1 000 km vers l'ouest, jusqu'au berceau de la kora, sur le littoral gambien. Tout cela faisait partie de l'empire mandé à son apogée, jusqu'au nord du fleuve Niger, à Tombouctou. Sissoko s'arrête à Sibi, où Soundjata aurait réuni ses armées, conclu des pactes et créé la constitution de ce qui allait devenir le plus grand empire d'Afrique.
La cinématographie de la campagne, en grande partie réalisée à partir de drones aériens, est magnifique. En passant par le sud du Sénégal, ils traversent le fleuve Casamance en bateau pour rendre visite au maître de la kora, Malan Diébaté. C'est le pays de la kora et une demi-douzaine de joueurs de kora apparaissent, chantant les louanges de Sissoko et de sa lignée.
Malan Diébaté dirige un spectacle à Darsilame, au Sénégal. Screengrab/Ballaké Sissoko : Kora Tales/Vimeo
Ils sont accompagnés par les femmes de leur famille élargie s'inspirant de la source diasporique et modèle de signature rythmique  de la clave urbaine cubaine.
Diébaté raconte les origines surnaturelles de la kora, et Sissoko part pour cet endroit précis, Sanementereng, en Gambie. D'une certaine manière, tous les instruments de musique sont magiques, étant donné l'impact qu'ils peuvent avoir sur nos vies. Des traditions orales très répandues attribuent les origines de la kora à cet endroit précis de la côte gambienne. Lorsque Sissoko arrive à cet endroit vers la fin du documentaire, près d'un puits sacré et d'un baobab qui marque l'endroit, c'est une expérience émouvante.
Un travail inspirant
Les scénaristes et réalisateurs du film, Lucy Durán et Laurent Benhamou, ont fait un travail inspirant en transmettant la beauté du paysage, la profondeur et l'humanité de la tradition, et la personnalité artistique de Sissoko.

"Depuis le 2 novembre 2023, l’ombre de Marie-Joseph Henri-Lopès, plus connu sous le nom d'Henri-Lopès, voltige sur la rive gauche de la Seine, direction : le fleuve Congo. L'écrivain de renom est décédé à Paris en ce début du mois de novembre à Suresnes en île de France. Il avait 86 ans. Il a parcouru, presque toute sa vie, au propre comme au figuré, ce trajet Europe-Afrique, comme une configuration de sa double appartenance.
Nous autres, adolescents des années 1990, ne pouvons parler de lui qu’à travers ses oeuvres, telles qu’elles ont contribué à renforcer notre éducation citoyenne, la connaissance de notre continent, ainsi que notre place dans le monde, en tant que sujets du monde.
De la dizaine d'oeuvres de l'écrivain congolais par lesquelles nous avions été socialisés figurent, entre autres, Tribaliques (1971) qui le consacre Grand prix littéraire d’Afrique noire, La nouvelle romance (1976), Sans tam-tams (1977), Le pleurer-rire (1983), Le chercheur d'Afriques (1990), Sur l'autre rive (1992).
A quoi s'ajouteraient les titres les plus récents comme Ma grand-mère bantoue et mes ancêtres gaulois_ (2003), Le lys et le flamboyant (1997), Une enfant de Poto-Poto (2012), Il est déjà demain (2018).
Je m'intéresse à la littérature des pays du Sud, à la théorie du champ littéraire, à la pensée postcoloniale et à l’analyse du discours social. Je dirais que deux grandes mythologies pourraient en constituer les axes majeurs. Ce sont les tandems: littérature/politique et Europe/Afrique. D’un site à l’autre, l’illustre écrivain aura réussi à instituer brillamment un tiers-espace d’une façon qui transcende les clivages traditionnels qui opposent l'Afrique et l'Europe.
Ainsi, du point de vue du rapport, structurellement tendu, entre “littérature” et “politique”, Henri Lopès est parvenu à voguer avec élégance entre les deux espaces. En effet, il est un des rares acteurs politiques sur le continent à avoir su concilier ses activités politiques avec sa carrière d’écrivain sans se laisser disqualifier par le champ du pouvoir dont on connaît suffisamment l’impact aliénant sur le champ.
Il fut, tour à tour, ministre de l’Education (1969), des Affaires étrangères (1972) ; Premier ministre (1973-1975) ; ministre des Finances (1980); haut fonctionnaire international (1982-1998) et ambassadeur (1998-2015).
Engagement critique
Il a pu passer plus de 50 ans sa vie à témoigner de l’histoire politique au quotidien de son pays et du continent, voyant se succéder des hommes, des régimes et des mutations sans se faire éjecter lui-même du système. Surtout, il a su appréhender les thèmes politiques par la médiation de la création littéraire, qu’il a abordés avec un humour savoureux qu’on pourrait retrouver chez un Sony Labou Tans’i (écrivain à succès, lui aussi originaire du Congo-Brazaville) ou encore chez un Alain Mabanckou (écrivain originaire, lui aussi, du Congo, et fortement représentatif de la diaspora africaine en France).
Ni adepte du pamphlet ou du brûlot, encore moins des tracts aux slogans révolutionnaires renversants, le style littéraire d’Henri Lopès a su se faire diplomatie, engagement critique et responsabilité dans l’action.
Ainsi, relativement au rapport, non moins tendu, entre l’Europe et l’Afrique, cet enfant de Pôtô (un quartier populaire de Brazzaville, la capitale du Congo), à la grand-mère batou et aux ancêtres gaulois (par son rapport à la France au détriment de la Belgique d'où son père était originaire), a su parfaitement pratiquer, tout en l’incarnant, l’antithèse des théories du nativisme que dénonçait Achille Mbembe dans “Les écritures africaines de soi”.
Il s'agit d'une conception radicale de l'africanité, en tant que fruit de la négritude, dont on connaît parfaitement la suprématie sur le discours social des années 1930-1980.
Une troisième voie
“Le sang mêlé” (la goutte de sang portugais de Léopold Sédar Senghor, 1961) d’Henri Lopès, sa poétique rhizomique (Edouard Glissant, 1992) ont fait de lui l’incarnation d’une troisième voie. Celle-ci n'est pas élaborée sur le mode du “métis” de tendance essentialiste que déconstruisit avec raison l’anthropologue Jean-Loup Amselle.
Tout ceci semble avoir généré au fil des mouvements de l’histoire, l’imagination idéalement postcoloniale de l’identité africaine dont Henri Lopès a su imaginer et styliser par anticipation la posture, ainsi que la configuration, conformément à la réalité d’une l’Afrique sans cesse en mutation.

Mais les réseaux sociaux peuvent aussi devenir - et sont, souvent devenus - un environnement toxique où se propagent la désinformation, la haine et les conflits.
La plupart des gens ne peuvent pas ou ne veulent pas se passer des réseaux sociaux. Les mesures prises par les tribunaux et des organismes publics pour les réguler ou les contrôler sont en train de rattraper lentement leur retard, mais ont jusqu'à présent infructueuses. Et les entreprises de médias sociaux ont l'habitude de donner la priorité à l'interaction au détriment du bien-être social.
Les utilisateurs se retrouvent face à un dilemme : comment tirer profit des réseaux sociaux sans s'exposer à des contenus qui génèrent du stress, nuisibles ou illégaux? Cette question se pose avec encore plus d'acuité en période de tensions et de conflits mondiaux. Le conflit en Ukraine et maintenant la guerre de Gaza ont augmenté le risque de voir des images horribles et nuisibles sur son fil d'actualité.
Cet article, basé sur mes recherches sur l'actualité dans les médias sociaux, est un guide de sélection et d'édition de vos flux de médias sociaux afin de vous assurer que le contenu que vous voyez est adapté à vos besoins et n'est pas offensant ou dérangeant.
Il est organisé selon les catégories de médias sociaux les plus grands. Je ne couvre pas les nouveaux services tels que Threads, Mastodon, Post et Bluesky, bien que les principes leur soient généralement applicables. Je me suis focalisée sur l'utilisation de ces applications sur un téléphone portable, car c'est ce que font la majorité des utilisateurs, plutôt que de les utiliser sur un navigateur web. Je me concentre principalement sur le contenu vidéo.
Les réseaux sociaux peuvent être un outil puissant d'information et d'apprentissage, mais ils sont imparfaits. Quelle que soit l'approche que vous adoptez pour gérer vos flux, restez prudents et sceptiques. Soyez attentifs aux mises à jour des politiques et des accords d'utilisation et réfléchissez bien aux personnes auxquelles vous faites confiance et que vous suivez.
Est-ce votre choix ou le leur ?
De nombreux réseaux sociaux proposent un flux sélectionné de manière algorithmique comme premier point de contact. Les détails des algorithmes ne sont pas connus du public et les entreprises les affinent constamment. Le flux est en grande partie basé sur votre localisation et sur les sujets et les personnes pour lesquels vous avez manifesté un intérêt précédemment (que vous ayez suivi ou simplement regardé ou interagi avec le contenu). Il peut également inclure d'autres informations telles que votre âge et votre sexe, que vous avez peut-être déjà communiquées au service.
Les organisations et les particuliers investissent de l'argent et du temps pour s'assurer que leur contenu soit vu. Les annonceurs paieront également pour que leur contenu soit montré aux clients qui répondent à leurs critères. Il est également important de se rappeler que les contenus payants ne sont pas seulement des biens et des services à vendre, mais qu'ils peuvent aussi avoir un objectif politique ou social, souvent caché. C'est la base des fake news et de la désinformation.
Voici quelques outils pour gérer vos fils d'actualité sur les réseaux sociaux
Soyez prudents dans le choix de vos abonnements
Sur tous les réseaux, à l'exception de TikTok, la clé consiste à sélectionner avec soin les personnes que vous suivez.
Sur Twitter (X), la meilleure solution consiste à s'éloigner de la page “Pour vous” (qui est l'interface par défaut) et à se concentrer sur la page “Abonnements”. Vous ne pouvez pas supprimer entièrement la page “Pour vous”. Le flux “Abonnements” comprend toutes les personnes que vous suivez, leurs tweets et leurs retweets.
Si vous voyez des contenus que vous ne souhaitez pas voir, vous pouvez vous désabonner, les bloquer ou les masquer.
La manière la plus simple de nettoyer votre fil d'actualité Facebook est “défreinder” (cesser d'être l'ami de quelqu'un sur le réseau social). Une autre option est de ne plus suivre quelqu'un: vous restez amis, la personne concernée peut voir votre contenu et s'y intéresser, mais ses publications n'apparaîtront pas dans votre fil d'actualité, à moins qu'elle ne vous mentionne ou que vous ne la recherchiez. Vous pouvez également “faire une pause” avec quelqu'un, ce qui constitue une sorte de blocage temporaire. Le blocage est l'option la plus extrême. Il supprime la personne et tout son contenu, et cache tout le vôtre.
Instagram propose des options similaires pour supprimer un utilisateur et le masquer (à l'instar de l'option “prendre une pause” de Facebook).
TikTok n'offre aux utilisateurs que des options limitées pour filtrer ou organiser leur fil d'actualité. La page “Abonnements” n'affiche que les créateurs que vous suivez (et les publicités). Elle n'est pas et ne peut pas être définie comme l'affichage par défaut.
La page “Pour vous” est entièrement pilotée par des algorithmes. Cliquer sur un créateur vous permet uniquement de le suivre, et non de le masquer ou de le bloquer. Vous pouvez toutefois bloquer des utilisateurs spécifiques. Cliquez sur leur profil, puis sur l'icône de partage. Les options “Signaler” et “Bloquer” se trouvent sous les différentes options de partage. Le blocage supprime le contenu de l'utilisateur, mais pas le contenu des autres utilisateurs qui le présentent.
Explorez vos paramètres
De nombreuses plateformes proposent des options permettant de limiter les contenus violents ou graphiques. Sur Facebook, ces options se trouvent dans le menu Paramètres. De là, cliquez sur “Fil d'actualité”, puis sur “Réduire”. Vous ne pouvez pas supprimer ce contenu, mais vous pouvez le déplacer vers le bas de votre fil d'actualité.
Sur TikTok, un appui long sur l'écran fait apparaître le panneau des options. De là, vous pouvez signaler une vidéo ; il y a aussi une option “pas intéressé” pour supprimer cette vidéo et d'autres avec des hashtags similaires de votre fil d'actualité. Si vous cliquez sur “détails” pour voir quels hashtags seront filtrés, vous pouvez en sélectionner certains à bloquer. Toutefois, la fiabilité de cette option n'est pas évidente : les hashtags changent au fil du temps. Un certain nombre de hashtags ne peuvent apparemment pas être filtrés, mais on ne sait pas exactement de quoi il s'agit ni pourquoi ils ne peuvent pas l'être.
L'option “Préférences de contenu” sous “Paramètres” vous permet de filtrer les mots-clés vidéo. Cela permet de les supprimer de votre page “Pour vous”, de votre page “Abonnements”, ou des deux.
Vous pouvez également mettre TikTok en “mode restreint”. Cela limite l'accès aux “contenus inappropriés” – une description opaque.
Attention aux utilisateurs
Il ne s'agit pas d'un guide parfait, car les médias sociaux ne sont pas conçus pour être contrôlés par l'utilisateur. Ces entreprises sont basées sur l'engagement des utilisateurs : plus vous passez de temps sur leur application, plus elles gagnent de l'argent. Elles ne s'intéressent pas particulièrement à l'utilité ou à l'exactitude du contenu.",Contenu des médias sociaux en temps de guerre : un guide d'experts sur la manière d'éviter la violence sur vos fils d'actualité,Null
"Les classements mondiaux des universités sont publiés vers la fin de chaque année. Les établissements du monde entier se précipitent pour savoir comment ils s'en sortent. Ont-ils progressé ou régressé ? Dans l'affirmative, de combien de places et dans quels classements ? Ont-ils maintenu leur position dans un contexte mondial de l'enseignement supérieur de plus en plus compétitif ?
Les performances des universités africaines se sont améliorées. Mais elles ne figurent toujours pas en bonne place dans les classements. Dans le Classement mondial des universités 2024, THE (The Times Higher Education, par exemple), l'université sud-africaine du Cap arrive en tête pour le continent, à la 167e place. Elle est suivie par trois autres établissements sud-africains : l'université de Stellenbosch et l'université de Witwatersrand, qui se situent entre 301 et 350, et l'université de Johannesburg, entre 401 et 500.
La première institution subsaharienne non sud-africaine, l'université ghanéenne de Cape Coast, se trouve dans le groupe 601-800. L'université ougandaise de Makerere, classée entre le 801e et 1 000e, est la première d'Afrique de l'Est.
La valeur, les méthodologies et les implications des classements mondiaux des universités font l'objet de nombreux débats. Plusieurs institutions, comme l'université d'Utrecht aux Pays-Bas, ont même retiré leur participation à certains classements. Elles critiquent l'accent mis sur la concurrence et les scores plutôt que sur les partenariats et la science ouverte.
Nous sommes particulièrement intéressés par un ajout récent aux critères de classements : l'évaluation de la durabilité et de l'impact sociétal positif.Les classements selon l'impact, par exemple, évaluent les performances des universités par rapport aux Objectifs de développement durable (ODD) des Nations unies. Le Classement QS en matière de développement durable inclut les dimensions liées à l'environnement et l'impact social.
En tant qu'universitaires travaillant dans le domaine de l'innovation sociale et du développement durable, nous nous félicitons de l'attention portée à l'impact et à la durabilité. Le développement durable est une préoccupation essentielle pour les universités du monde entier. Il est le moteur de la recherche et de l'innovation des établissements. Il est important pour les étudiants. Il est au cœur de l'enseignement et de l'apprentissage. Il sous-tend également le rôle et les activités plus larges des universités au sein des communautés, des sociétés et des économies.
Relever le défi du développement durable est une préoccupation particulièrement urgente pour les universités africaines.
Un mandat et une mission
Les universités africaines travaillent dans des contextes où les besoins sont importants. De nombreuses économies africaines ont connu une croissance rapide récemment, mais des défis en matière de développement durable subsistent. Il s'agit notamment de la pauvreté et des inégalités en matière de genre, de santé, d'éducation et d'opportunités. Les conflits autour des ressources et les effets du changement climatique constituent également des défis majeurs.

Certaines universités africaines ont été créées dans le but de relever ces défis et de promouvoir le développement et la prospérité.
Il est donc très encourageant de constater que plusieurs universités africaines sont bien placées dans certains de ces nouveaux classements selon l'impact. Certaines d'entre elles sont même des leaders mondiaux dans la réalisation de divers objectifs de développement durable.
Par exemple, l'université sud-africaine de Johannesburg se classe 46e dans le classement The Impact Rankings 2023 (Classements selon l'impact). Elle est première au niveau mondial pour son travail sur l'ODD 1 (élimination de la pauvreté). Elle y est parvenue grâce à des initiatives telles que Missing Middle Fund, qui bénéficie à plus de 60 % des étudiants de l'université. Elle investit également beaucoup dans les centres de recherche, les instituts et les chaires qui se concentrent sur les questions de pauvreté. Elle les aide à mener des recherches qui ont un impact direct sur les communautés locales et sur l'élaboration des politiques.
L'Université des sciences et technologies Kwame Nkrumah (KNUST) du Ghana, quant à elle, obtient la meilleure note pour sa contribution à l’ODD 4 (Éducation de qualité). Les étudiants de l'institution bénéficient d'un excellent enseignement, complété par des investissements dans des infrastructures modernes, des TIC et des ressources d'apprentissage en ligne. Elle offre de nombreuses bourses et gère des programmes tels que “Soutenir un étudiant dans le besoin avec un ordinateur portable”.
Read more: Sustainable development goals are in reach if African universities work together
Une autre tendance positive pour les universités africaines dans les classements selon l'impact est qu'elles travaillent de plus en plus ensemble et avec des partenaires au niveau mondial. Par exemple, l'université de Makerere et le Bertha Centre for Social Innovation de l'université du Cap sont partenaires au sein de la Social Innovation in Health Initiative. Cette initiative vise à promouvoir l'innovation sociale dans le domaine de la santé (ODD 3 - Bonne santé et bien-être) sur le continent et dans d'autres pays à revenu faible ou intermédiaire.
Ces histoires positives et de plus en plus d'exemples de leadership africain méritent d'être salués. Et il est possible d'aller encore plus loin.
Combler les lacunes
Des recherches supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour comprendre comment les universités africaines œuvrent en faveur du développement durable et ce qu'elles peuvent faire de plus. Cela pourrait révéler des moyens d'améliorer le travail existant et de partager les meilleures pratiques.
Les universités peuvent permettre de trouver des solutions aux défis du développement durable. Elles génèrent des connaissances et peuvent influencer l'élaboration des politiques et les pratiques. Elles peuvent elles-mêmes développer des solutions innovantes. En tant qu'employeurs, acheteurs et utilisateurs de ressources importants, elles peuvent avoir des effets positifs (et négatifs) à travers leurs activités.
La recherche sur le rôle des universités dans leurs communautés, y compris et au-delà de l'enseignement et de la recherche, s'est concentrée sur les pays du Nord. Les universités du Sud (et en particulier celles d'Afrique) ont souvent été négligées. Cette attention relativement limitée peut refléter des inégalités plus larges dans la production mondiale de connaissances et des perceptions négatives du travail des universités africaines.
Nous voulons combler ces lacunes. C'est pourquoi nous avons lancé un nouveau projet de recherche international, interinstitutionnel et interdisciplinaire. Le projet “Les universités africaines en tant que catalyseurs de l'innovation sociale et du développement durable” est financé par le Worldwide Universities Network. Il réunit des chercheurs des universités du Cap, de Sheffield, du Ghana, de Leeds, de Pretoria et de York, ainsi que de l'université de Makerere.
Le projet se déroulera sur les 12 prochains mois. Nous utiliserons une perspective d'innovation sociale pour étudier comment les universités africaines contribuent à la réalisation des objectifs de développement durable des Nations unies. Nous espérons que ce projet permettra de créer une communauté d'universitaires travaillant sur le sujet en Afrique et en dehors, et qu'il apportera des éclairages académiques et pratiques.",Les classements mondiaux des universités tiennent désormais compte de l'impact social : les universités africaines démarrent en force,Null
"Au bout des cinq années prévues par la Constitution, les autorités convoquent les électeurs malgaches pour élire leur prochain président, le 16 novembre 2023. L'élection présidentielle sera suivie par les élections législatives qui confieront, sans nul doute, la majorité au parti du président élu. Les différentes élections au niveau local confirmeront dans la même logique cette tendance à l’hégémonie. C’est donc un enjeu important.
Un tel édifice n’est que la partie visible d’un mécanisme de verrouillage qui ne laisse que peu de place à l’opposition ; l’ensemble est éminemment crisogène. Comme pour la majorité des précédentes élections, celles à venir présentent tous les signes d’une crise politique dans un contexte économique plus que difficile et un climat social explosif. Madagascar est sans doute le seul pays au monde qui connaît une régression économique quasi continue depuis plusieurs décennies sans qu’il n’y ait un conflit d’importance sur son sol.
Cette régression s'est particulièrement aggravée sous les deux présidences d’Andry Nirina Rajoelina, qui ont connu plusieurs cas de famine, dans le sud de Madagascar notamment.
Mes recherches portent sur l'histoire politique de Madagascar. Dans cet article, j'analyse les facteurs qui vont influencer les résultats du scrutin présidentiel du 16 novembre à Madagascar.
Manipulation des institutions
La particularité de ces élections à venir est que nous ne sommes pas face à une crise provoquée par des opposants qui réclament le pouvoir et sont prêts pour cela à sortir du cadre constitutionnel. Ce fut le cas en 2009, quand Andry Rajoelina, le président sortant, est arrivé au pouvoir à la suite d'un coup d'Etat ; il l’exercera le temps d’un mandat légal pour ensuite se faire élire en 2018, avec une forte suspicion de fraudes électorales et sous la pression de l’importation d’armes de guerre acquises avant son élection.
Depuis, le régime en place est sorti de la légalité à plusieurs reprises en bafouant les lois et en manipulant les institutions, notamment pour préparer l'élection présidentielle à venir. La Commission électorale nationale indépendante (Ceni) chargée de l’organisation des élections est inféodée au pouvoir.
Le président de la Ceni n’est autre que le mari d’une ministre, pour ne parler que du sommet visible. La Haute Cour constitutionnelle abrite en son sein des hommes du président sortant. Celle-ci a notamment validé la candidature de ce dernier alors que la révélation de la nationalité française (qui lui fait perdre la nationalité malgache selon la Constitution qu’il a lui-même fait élaborer et voter en 2010) a été largement relatée dans la presse locale et internationale.
De même, selon cette même Constitution, le président du Sénat remplace à la tête de l’État le président de la République, démissionnaire et parti en campagne électorale. Or au dernier moment, le premier a refusé la charge pour la confier à un gouvernement collégial chargé d’organiser les élections et dirigé par le Premier ministre d’Andry Rajoelina, Christian Ntsay.
Mise au pas du pouvoir législatif
Le président du Sénat Herimanana Razafimahefa a cédé sous la pression, pour dénoncer quelques jours plus tard “une pratique mafieuse”, selon ses mots sur les antennes de France 24. Or, en décembre 2022, plus de deux tiers des députés de l’Assemblée nationale comprenant une grosse majorité de la coalition soutenant le régime ont déposé une motion de censure contre ce même gouvernement conduit par le Premier ministre Christian Ntsay. Ceux-ci se sont fait rappeler à l’ordre en quelques jours et ont finalement retiré la motion. Un fait qui illustre la mise au pas du pouvoir législatif.
Le président du Sénat sera destitué quelques temps plus tard par ses pairs, eux aussi inféodés au parti présidentiel, sous l’accusation de “déficience mentale”. Il sera remplacé par un militaire à la retraite, certes, mais connu pour ses méthodes brutales et sa proximité d’avec Andry Rajoelina.
Flou sur le nombre d'électeurs
Parmi les autres anomalies qui risquent de biaiser les résultats de cette élection présidentielle figurent le manque de transparence sur le nombre de votants et celui des bureaux de vote. Autant de raisons de penser que ces élections sont un jeu de dupes.
Or, la légitimité d’Andry Rajoelina est au plus bas dans l'opinion. Plusieurs scandales émaillent son mandat. Le dernier en date est ce que la presse locale qualifie de “Romigate”, du nom de sa directrice de cabinet, arrêtée en flagrant délit et emprisonnée au Royaume-Uni pour avoir négocié des pots de vin auprès d’une compagnie minière britannique, Gemfields, afin de lui accorder des concessions à Madagascar.
Pour embellir son bilan, lors d’une interview sur France 24 et RFI, Rajoelina relativise les chiffres de la Banque mondiale et du Fonds monétaire international. Il se targue de gagner la prochaine élection, grâce aux réalisations de son régime, dès le premier tour. Très confiant, il a même fait l’acquisition, hors de tout cadre légal, du logiciel Predator capable d’espionner citoyens normaux et surtout opposants.
Pour mobiliser ses partisans, Rajoelina joue donc sur la fibre sentimentale et populiste. Distribution de T-shirts, tickets repas, d’argent et giga concerts émaillent les débuts de sa campagne électorale, mobilisant des fonds faramineux et impossibles à contrôler.
Doléances de l'opposition
Pour ces raisons, 11 candidats sur les 13 en lice se liguent pour réclamer la disqualification d’Andry Rajoelina qui n’est plus citoyen malgache du fait de l‘acquisition volontaire de la nationalité française en 2014, la refonte de la liste électorale, la mise en place d’un gouvernement neutre le temps des élections, d’une Ceni vraiment indépendante et de la reforme de la Haute cour constitutionelle, sans parler d’une limitation légale des fonds utilisés lors de la campagne électorale.
Des manifestations de rue drainant de plus en plus de monde sont organisées dans la capitale, de manière quotidienne. Les forces de l‘ordre les répriment violemment, blessant au moins deux candidats sans parler des manifestants, obligeant les autorités à reporter la date du premier tour, qui était initialement prévu le 9 novembre.
Un rapport de force à l’issue incertaine s’est donc engagé entre d’une part Andry Rajoelina, parti en campagne pratiquement tout seul, et les autres candidats qui demandent au préalable une clarification des règles.
Dernièrement, Roland Ratsiraka (neveu de l'ancien président Didier Ratsiraka), l’un des 11 candidats a révélé à la presse qu’un proche de Andry Rajoelina lui avait proposé de financer sa campagne s’il se lançait dans la bataille électorale. Comme c’est le cas du candidat Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko, sorti du sérail et arrivé sur le tard dans les rangs de l’opposition, donné, avant le bras de fer, comme un de ceux qui ont le potentiel de battre Andry Rajoelina.
Dans de telles conditions, aller aux élections ne ferait qu'aggraver une crise latente. Les risques de division des forces armées politiquement instrumentalisées sont réels. Ceux qui sont dans la chaîne de commandement perçoivent des rétributions en échange de leur loyauté. De toutes les manières, la paralysie du secteur formel incluant la machine administrative aggravera le ce marasme économique.","Madagascar, une élection présidentielle à haut risque",Null
"Dans les pays du Sud, les femmes effectuent entre trois et sept fois plus de tâches de soins que les hommes. Ces tâches comprennent les travaux domestiques et se concentrent principalement sur les soins aux enfants.
Il faut espérer que cette situation évolue. Le Rapport 2023 sur la situation des pères dans le monde, intitulé “Centrer les soins dans un monde en crise”, a exploré les expériences et l'implication dans les soins de 12 000 hommes et femmes, dont beaucoup sont des parents, dans 17 pays. L'enquête s'est penchée sur ceux qui s'occupent des soins, comment ils s'en occupent, pour qui, et sur ce que les hommes et les femmes pensent des soins.
Je suis l'un des cinq coauteurs du rapport, qui révèle une remarquable appréciation des soins de la part des personnes interrogées. Dans une enquête en ligne, ils ont massivement associé les soins à des termes positifs. L’“amour” est le mot le plus fréquemment mentionné dans tous les pays.
Parmi les autres mots fréquemment cités figurent “aide”, “protection”, “attention”, “responsabilité”, “santé”, “gentillesse” et “famille”.
La plupart des hommes ayant participé à l'enquête ont déclaré qu'ils effectuaient des tâches de soin et qu'ils étaient disposés à en faire davantage. Mais de nombreux obstacles se dressent sur leur chemin, notamment les normes sociétales et les contraintes financières. Si les résultats de l'étude laissent entrevoir des changements, ils montrent également que le rythme de ces changements est beaucoup trop lent.
Pression croissante en faveur d'une plus grande égalité
Au début de cette année, les États membres des Nations unies ont désigné à l'unanimité le 29 octobre journée internationale des soins et de l'assistance. Cela veut dire qu'il y a de plus en plus de reconnaissance de la valeur des soins et du travail de soins et met en évidence le besoin urgent de répartir plus équitablement les responsabilités en matière de soins.
Fournir des soins à une autre personne peut être une expérience positive, favorisant l'empathie et des relations constructives. Cependant, la répartition inégale des soins entre les hommes et les femmes entrave depuis longtemps la participation des femmes au travail rémunéré.
En 2018, l'Organisation internationale du travail a estimé que 606 millions de femmes en âge de travailler n'étaient pas en mesure de le faire en raison des tâches de soin non rémunérées. Et le lourd fardeau de ce travail de soins a eu des conséquences néfastes sur le bien-être physique et mental des femmes.
Aller dans la bonne direction
Le rapport sur la situation des pères dans le monde révèle que les mères continuent d'assumer une plus grande part de responsabilité dans les tâches de soins, telles que le nettoyage, les soins physiques et émotionnels pour les enfants, la cuisine et les soins pour le/la conjoint(e). Les femmes ont déclaré avoir effectué 1,32 fois de plus de soins physiques aux enfants et avoir fait 1,36 de fois de plus de ménage que les hommes dans tous les pays étudiés dans le rapport.
Mais les pères de pays aussi divers que l'Argentine, l'Irlande, la Chine, la Croatie et le Rwanda ont également déclaré consacrer un nombre d'heures important à diverses tâches non rémunérées au sein du foyer.
L'étude sur la situation des pères dans le monde attribue cette évolution à plusieurs facteurs, dont l'impact du COVID-19, l'évolution des normes sexospécifiques relatives à la prestation de soins et des facteurs structurels tels que les systèmes de soins et les politiques en matière de congé parental.
Dans 15 pays, entre 70 et 90 % des hommes sont d'accord avec l'affirmation suivante : “Je me sens autant responsable des tâches de soins que ma partenaire”.
Fait encourageant, dans certains pays comme l'Afrique du Sud (85 %) et le Rwanda (93 %), les hommes n'étaient pas d'accord avec l'affirmation suivante : “On ne devrait pas apprendre aux garçons à coudre, à cuisiner, à faire le ménage ou à s'occuper de leurs frères et sœurs”.
Les hommes plus conscients de leurs émotions et ouverts à solliciter un soutien émotionnel étaient deux à huit fois plus susceptibles de s'occuper d'un membre de leur famille que ceux qui n'étaient pas conscients de leurs émotions.
Les hommes qui passaient plus de temps à s'occuper des autres ressentaient un plus grand bien-être. Les personnes interrogées qui se sont déclarées satisfaites de leur participation à l'éducation de leurs enfants étaient 1,5 fois plus susceptibles d'être d'accord avec l'affirmation “Je suis la personne que j'ai toujours voulu être” et de faire état d'un sentiment de gratitude dans la vie que les personnes interrogées qui ne se sont pas déclarées satisfaites de l'éducation de leurs enfants.
Tout le monde doit participer
Il est important de reconnaître que la prise en charge d'un enfant ne peut pas dépendre uniquement des efforts individuels. Les hommes et les femmes ont besoin du soutien des communautés, des systèmes de soins et des politiques pour prodiguer des soins de manière efficace.
Plus de la moitié des mères et des pères considèrent que l'activisme en faveur des politiques de congé pour soins est une priorité. Ce sentiment varie : 57 % des pères et 66 % des mères en Inde, et 92 % des pères et 94 % des mères au Rwanda soutiennent cette cause.
Les femmes sont plus enclines que les hommes à donner la priorité aux politiques de soins, au même titre que les politiques de santé et d'égalité entre les hommes et les femmes. Les préoccupations concernant le coût de la vie étaient sont assez répandues chez les deux sexe, avec un peu plus de femmes (58 %) que d'hommes (53 %) exprimant cette inquiétude.
L'étude a révélé qu'une proportion importante de personnes dans tous les pays ont déclaré prendre des mesures  pour améliorer les politiques de soins. La majorité d'entre elles (74 %) ont discuté de la question avec leurs amis et leur famille, tandis que 39 % des femmes et 36 % des hommes ont signé ou partagé des pétitions en ligne. En outre, 27 % des femmes et 33 % des hommes ont participé à des manifestations appelant à l'amélioration des politiques de soins.
Les décideurs politiques ont un rôle important à jouer dans les réformes visant à améliorer le congé parental. De meilleures données permettent d'élaborer de meilleures politiques. Il faut donc disposer de statistiques plus précises sur, par exemple, le nombre de pères qui prennent un congé parental et la répartition du temps consacré aux soins entre les hommes et les femmes.

"_La Côte d'Ivoire a annoncé son intention de lancer son premier satellite dans les deux prochaines années. Une équipe de scientifiques spécialisés en astrophysique et en géologie explique à The Conversation Africa les avantages potentiels de cette avancée et comment le pays envisage de concrétiser ses ambitions dans le secteur spatial.
Quel type de satellite la Côte d'Ivoire prévoit-elle de lancer ?
YAM-SAT-CI 01 sera un nanosatellite pour l'observation de la Terre. Un nanosatellite est un petit satellite, pesant entre 1kg à 10kg. Il sera équipé d'une caméra capable de fournir des images de la côte, des forêts, des parcs naturels et des zones urbaines du pays.
La construction du satellite est entièrement ivoirienne. Elle a été confiée à Universal Konstructors Associated, une entreprise privée ivoirienne promouvant le développement scientifique et technologique, en partenariat avec l'Institut National Polytechnique Félix Houphouët-Boigny de Yamoussoukro.
Il s'agit de la première étape vers des satellites et des capteurs plus sophistiqués qui ont de nombreuses applications. Ils peuvent par exemple détecter, surveiller et cartographier les menaces qui pèsent sur la sécurité nationale, l'immigration clandestine, la déforestation, les activités illégales d'exploitation aurifère, l'humidité des sols et les réservoirs d'eau. Ils peuvent contribuer à minimiser les conséquences des inondations ou des sécheresses.
En Côte d'Ivoire, un tel satellite pourrait appuyer les efforts du gouvernement visant à réglementer l'exploitation minière artisanale et à lutter contre les activités illégales et la dégradation de l'environnement.
Ces applications reposent sur des algorithmes sophistiqués de traitement d'images, notamment l'utilisation de l'intelligence artificielle.
Quels sont les autres avantages et retombées potentiels ?
L'observation de la Terre fournit des données pour l'agriculture, la gestion des catastrophes et la planification urbaine. Le satellite prend en charge diverses applications, notamment la surveillance de la santé, de la végétation, la cartographie des ressources en eau et l'analyse des modèles de croissance urbaine.
Outre les avantages directs de la technologie, elle contribue au développement scientifique et économique de la nation.
Le projet de construction et de lancement d'un satellite s'accompagne généralement d'un renforcement des capacités dans de nombreux secteurs liés à l'industrie spatiale. Il implique des ingénieurs et des scientifiques pour développer des capteurs et le segment terrestre permettant de suivre le satellite et de communiquer avec lui.
D'autres avantages importants de ces projets incluent une utilisation plus large de la technologie spatiale. Le lancement d'un satellite peut conduire à une utilisation accrue des données et des produits d'observation de la Terre, fournis par les nombreux satellites en orbite autour de notre planète.
Qui sera impliqué dans ce projet ?
Les secteurs académique et privé ont tous un rôle à jouer dans cette aventure scientifique, technique et politique.
Par exemple, l'Institut National Polytechnique Félix Houphouet-Boigny a déjà prévu de mettre en place de nouveaux cursus dans le domaine de l'espace et de l'aéronautique. Une nouvelle génération de jeunes ingénieurs en bénéficiera directement. Par ailleurs, une association ivoirienne d'astronomie a été lancée. Ses activités de sensibilisation visant à promouvoir l'astronomie et les sciences spatiales auprès du grand public permettront d'accroître la culture scientifique de la population. Elle pourra inspirer la jeune génération à suivre des carrières scientifiques.
Enfin, l'Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny dispose d'un laboratoire spécialisé en matière d'observation de la Terre depuis l'espace : le Centre Universitaire de Recherche et d'Application en Télédétection. Ses étudiants peuvent également contribuer à la conception, à la stratégie liée à la mission et aux applications des satellites ivoiriens.
Que font les autres pays africains en matière de technologie spatiale ?
Le rapport sur l'industrie spatiale en 2022 de la société de conseil Space in Africa indique que la valeur de l'industrie en Afrique devrait atteindre 22,64 milliards de dollars en 2026, contre 19,49 milliards de dollars en 2021. Le rapport indique que les nations africaines ont alloué 534,9 millions de dollars aux programmes spatiaux en 2022, contre 523,2 millions de dollars en 2021. Ces investissements indiquent que l'Afrique se prépare à une utilisation plus large de la technologie spatiale pour faire face aux divers défis auxquels elle fait face.
Par exemple, le 23 avril 2023, le Kenya a lancé son premier satellite, appelé Taifa-1, avec l'aide de SpaceX. Le satellite est équipé d'une caméra optique et devrait fournir des données de surveillance agricole et environnementale pour le Kenya.
En 2021, la Tunisie a lancé son premier satellite 100% tunisien. Le Zimbabwe, l'Ouganda, l'Égypte et l'Angola ont également lancé des satellites au cours des 12 derniers mois. En avril 2023, le président Macky Sall a annoncé le lancement de l'Agence sénégalaise d'études spatiales.
L'Égypte, le Nigeria et l'Afrique du Sud sont les pays africains les plus avancés sur les questions spatiales. Par exemple, ZACube, lancé en décembre 2018, est un nanosatellite développé par l'Agence spatiale nationale sud-africaine en collaboration avec des universités locales. Il se concentre sur la sécurité du trafic maritime dans les eaux côtières sud-africaines.
L'agence nationale de recherche et de développement spatiaux du Nigeria a été créée en 1999. Elle a lancé cinq satellites depuis 2003.
En décembre 2022, le Nigeria et le Rwanda sont devenus les premiers pays africains à signer les Accords Artemis, un cadre dirigé par la NASA qui définit les meilleures pratiques en matière d'exploration spatiale durable.
Il est clair que de plus en plus de pays africains investissent dans les technologies spatiales.
La première étape consiste à sensibiliser la population sur les questions spatiales et aux avantages de l'investissement dans les technologies spatiales. Nous devons commencer à créer des cours de formation liés à l'espace et à promouvoir les sciences spatiales dans les pays africains.",La Côte d'Ivoire lance son premier satellite d'observation de la Terre fabriqué localement,Null
"En 1981, des scientifiques ont découvert que les poissons femelles exposés à des températures élevées développaient des testicules au lieu d’ovaires. Depuis, plus de 1 100 études sur différentes espèces animales, dont 400 sur des poissons d’eau douce, ont donné des résultats similaires.
Cela soulève plusieurs questions.
Pourquoi ce phénomène se produit-il ? Comment peut-on l’expliquer ? Est-ce que cela nuit aux populations de poissons à long terme ? Nos recherches ont montré qu’un facteur clé expliquant ce phénomène est la surproduction d’hormones de stress causée par des températures plus élevées.
Pas le temps de s’adapter
Les organes reproducteurs des poissons sont très malléables aux changements environnementaux, car contrairement aux mammifères, ils ont des structures plus simples. Si bien que même de légers changements des conditions de l’eau peuvent avoir un impact direct et significatif sur le métabolisme et la physiologie des poissons.

Les poissons utilisent cette plasticité à leur avantage en utilisant les signaux environnementaux pour modifier leur succès de reproduction selon les conditions saisonnières. Par exemple, plusieurs espèces de poissons, comme l’esturgeon jaune, se reproduisent au printemps en raison des températures plus chaudes de l’eau.
Cependant, des changements environnementaux soudains provoqués par le changement climatique, par exemple, affectent considérablement les populations de poissons et poussent certaines d’entre elles à se déplacer vers des habitats de reproduction plus adaptés.
La température peut changer les poissons femelles en mâles
L’étude de la façon dont les poissons femelles deviennent mâles (ou se masculinisent) en raison du changement de température a conduit à une avancée significative. Lorsque les poissons sont exposés à des températures en dehors de leur plage normale, ils deviennent stressés et présentent un niveau élevé de l’hormone de stress appelée cortisol. C’est le cas de plusieurs espèces de poissons, comme le Silverside argentin, le medaka et poisson-zèbre.
Il est intéressant de noter que la même enzyme qui génère le cortisol est également responsable de la production l’hormone mâle la plus puissante chez le poisson, appelée la 11-cétotestostérone. Le rôle de cette hormone mâle est de déclencher le développement des caractéristiques sexuelles masculines chez les poissons.
Si les poissons subissent un stress – c’est-à-dire une augmentation du cortisol – dû à des températures élevées, cela peut perturber l’équilibre hormonal des larves de poissons et entraîner le développement de testicules. La surproduction d’androgènes entraîne le développement d’un plus grand nombre de mâles que de femelles sous des températures élevées.
Pas seulement le stress
En 2019, notre groupe de recherche a démontré que le blocage des récepteurs de stress grâce à des outils d’édition génétique a complètement supprimé la masculinisation des poissons induite par les températures élevées. Ces résultats révèlent, pour la première fois, que le cerveau agit comme un moteur de la masculinisation induite par le stress thermique.
Dans notre nouvelle étude publiée dans Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences en 2023, nous avons en outre démontré que les hormones thyroïdiennes, en plus des hormones de stress, sont impliquées dans la masculinisation des poissons. Une fois de plus, grâce à l’édition génétique, nous avons pu bloquer les récepteurs du stress et démontrer que la voie des hormones thyroïdiennes est affectée lorsque les poissons subissent un stress.

Il a été observé que lorsque la production de cortisol et des hormones thyroïdiennes était supprimée par l’utilisation combinée de certains médicaments chimiques, aucune femelle n’était masculinisée. Comprendre les mécanismes moléculaires qui expliquent la détermination du sexe des poissons permet de prédire comment la température induite par les changements climatiques peut affecter les populations de poissons à l’avenir.
Le rôle de la pollution
Plusieurs contaminants environnementaux, comme les pesticides et les plastifiants, sont connus pour perturber l’équilibre hormonal chez les animaux. Ces contaminants – connus sous le nom de perturbateurs endocriniens – peuvent conduire au développement anormal des organes sexuels chez les poissons.
Avec les changements climatiques, les facteurs environnementaux qui affectent le développement sexuel constituent désormais un enjeu majeur. Dernièrement, les températures ont fluctué considérablement dépassant la plage acceptable pour la plupart des espèces de poissons. De tels changements provoquent des températures élevées, une acidification et une hypoxie qui peuvent altérer les ratios naturels du sexe des poissons en faveur des mâles, et même générer des populations de poissons exclusivement mâles.
Dans les rivières et les lacs, les événements interannuels tels qu’El Niño ou El Niña peuvent également être modifiés par les changements climatiques, ce qui peut provoquer d’importantes périodes d’inondation ou de sécheresse. Cela peut exacerber le stress exercé sur les poissons. De surcroît, un nombre trop faible de femelles dans une population de poissons peut provoquer son effondrement, avec des conséquences désastreuses sur la biodiversité pour tous.",Le stress induit par les changements climatiques modifie la reproduction des poissons,home page
"Entre Etats africains et mouvements sportifs nationaux, les conflits sont fréquents. C’est le cas du Sénégal qui connaît des relations conflictuelles entre le mouvement sportif et les pouvoirs publics qui délèguent leurs pouvoirs.
La presse a rapporté le cas du conflit entre l'Etat et la Federation sénégalaise de football en 2006, poussant la Fifa à proposer un comité adhoc chargé de normaliser les relations entre ces deux entités. Elle a également fait échos de la dissolution de la Fédération de basketball en 2013 suite à des fraudes sur l'âge des joueurs. Il y a eu en outre les difficultés liées à la répartition de subventions de l'Etat aux fédérations.
Les causes de ces conflits sont diverses. Il s’agit principalement de celle liées à l’omniprésence des pouvoirs publics dans la gouvernance du mouvement sportif et à la dépendance financière très forte des fédérations aux financements publics.
Nos recherches portent sur la gouvernance du sport, le droit et la sociologie du sport. Nous avons réalisé une étude sur ces conflits qui minent le sport sénégalais. Notre étude fait le diagnostic de ces conflits et propose quelques solutions.
Immixtion de l’Etat dans les affaires fédérales
L’immixtion de l’État dans les affaires fédérales se manifeste généralement à travers le principe de cogestion prévu par la loi portant charte du sport et la question de la cooptation de certains membres des fédérations par les pouvoirs publics.
La cogestion implique une délégation de pouvoirs de l’État aux fédérations. La délégation de pouvoir est un titre d’accès à la mission de service public. Elle ne dessaisit pas l’autorité publique. Ce faisant, la responsabilité de la pratique sportive relève conjointement de l’État, représenté par le ministère des Sports, et du mouvement sportif national. Ce modèle de gestion partagée entre le mouvement sportif et l’Etat souffre souvent de l'aspiration du mouvement sportif à garder son autonomie.
La cooptation est un mode de recrutement consistant à désigner des membres des instances dirigeantes d’une association par une voie autre que l’élection. L’effet apparent recherché est d’assurer une plus grande efficacité et une indépendance de la structure en raison de la qualité particulière des personnes choisies. Par contre, l’effet latent attendu de la cooptation est de domestiquer la structure par la fidélité de celle-ci aux pouvoirs publics.
La cooptation et la cogestion sont contestées par les acteurs du mouvement sportif. De l'avis des acteurs du mouvement sportif, elles remettent en question l'autonomie de celui-ci. Il en est de même des questions financières.
Dépendance financière des fédérations
Le financement soulève des oppositions liées à des enjeux de transparence, de dépendance des fédérations des fonds publics et au remplacement du fonds de relance par les conventions d’objectifs. Le fonds de relance alloué annuellement avait été créé en 1978. Ce fonds permettait à l'Etat, à travers son budget, de financer les fédérations et de contribuer à la formation des cadres, des sportifs, l’achat de matériels, etc.
Suite à la campagne de la Coupe du monde de football en 2002, où le Sénégal était parvenu à se hisser en quart de finale, un audit de l’Etat avait entraîné l’arrestation de plusieurs dirigeants sportifs. L'Etat était devenu plus regardant sur les subventions qu'il accordait.
En 2008, le fonds de relance a été supprimé avec l’avènement de Daouda Faye comme ministre des Sports. La signature de conventions d’objectifs a conditionné l’obtention de subventions pour les fédérations.
Or, la suppression du fonds de relance au profit des conventions d’objectifs n’est pas acceptée par les acteurs du sport même si le nouveau système recèle des avantages certains en termes de transparence et d’efficacité puisque les financements accordés par l'Etat aux fédérations dépendent d'objectifs définis à l'avance.
Proximité conflictuelle
Il convient de noter que l’État et les fédérations n’ont pas les mêmes représentations, les mêmes croyances. L’État, s’adossant au principe de cogestion déclinée dans sa charte du sport de 1984, ne veut pas être laissé à la marge de la gestion des affaires sportives. Ce qu’il manifeste dans le suivi des affaires sportives à travers le ministère des Sports (qui a délégué ces activités aux fédérations).
A travers les politiques sportives qu’il élabore, le ministère imprime des orientations qui peuvent se traduire par une forte immixtion dans les affaires fédérales. Ce qui entre souvent en opposition avec le principe d’autonomie dans ces fédérations. Deux logiques, deux systèmes de représentations s’opposent dès lors et ne peuvent trouver solutions qu’à travers des arrangements précaires.
La cooptation qui est imposée par les pouvoirs publics, refusée par la Fédération de football par exemple, est la manifestation la plus ostensible de cet état de fait. Les autres fédérations du fait de leur dépendance financière très forte de l'Etat restent soumises au principe de cooptation.
Au plan organisationnel, les deux organisations sont différentes. L’État est une personne morale de droit public avec pour mission principale de prendre en charge le service public du sport. Il passe par le moyen de la délégation de pouvoirs pour confier la gestion et le développement du sport au mouvement sportif. Mais dans le même temps, il garde la prérogative régalienne d’élaboration de la politique sportive.
Les fédérations, par contre, sont des personnes morales de droit privé disposant d'une autonomie. En cas de difficulté de collaboration avec l’État, ce dernier peut avoir recours au retrait de la délégation de pouvoirs comme cela été le cas en 2013 dans le basketball, suite à la fraude sur l’âge de certaines joueuses sénégalaises.
Néanmoins, ce retrait de la délégation et la mise en place d’un comité de normalisation va à l’encontre de l’action du mouvement sportif international qui peut, s’il le juge nécessaire, sanctionner l’État qui aurait tendance à s’immiscer dans les affaires fédérales.
Le mouvement sportif n'a pas atteint un degré de professionnalisme suffisant pour diversifier ses sources de financement. Il dépend donc largement des pouvoirs publics à travers les subventions et les infrastructures que ces derniers mettent à sa disposition. Ce qui crée des points de ruptures puisqu’il n’est pas possible de réclamer son autonomie alors qu’au même moment on n’arrive pas à assurer son autofinancement.
Réseaux de connivence
Au niveau des réseaux, les fédérations s’insèrent dans le mouvement sportif national, puis international en opposition à l’État, garant des affaires nationales internes.
En réalité, la cogestion et le principe de cooptation, au-delà des questions d’autonomie du mouvement sportif, ont fini d’installer des réseaux très étroits, de connivence, entre les responsables du ministère des Sports et les dirigeants sportifs. Ce qui favorise des actions complices qui ne sont pas forcément dans l’intérêt du développement du sport, mais au service d'intérêts personnels.
De plus, le personnel du mouvement sportif, qui n’a pas forcément une formation académique, est de plus en plus présent au ministère des Sports. Autrement dit, les dirigeants du mouvement sportif qui ont leurs systèmes spécifiques de pensée et d’action parviennent à se hisser à des niveaux de responsabilité élevés au ministère des Sports. Ce qui ne facilite pas une action efficace des pouvoirs publics sur les fédérations délégataires. Cela peut certes éteindre les sources de tensions et de contradictions, mais, ce n’est pas forcément efficace pour le débat contradictoire à même de soutenir la performance sportive.
Que faire?
Evidemment, en s’appuyant sur le modèle mandat-mandataire au plan formel, il est possible de trouver des oppositions puisque l’État délègue des pouvoirs au mouvement sportif. Au-delà de cette dimension, l'existence d'un système de coordination trans-organisationnel permet de dépasser des oppositions, souhaitables, puisque d'elles dépendent le contrôle public et les possibilités de performance sportive.
En conséquence, à la place de hiérarchie ou de relations mandats-mandataires, des arrangements institutionnels se créent à travers des réseaux qui parviennent à dépasser les points de rupture.
Ces réseaux trans-institutionnels entre le ministère des Sports et les fédérations montrent que les parties prenantes dans lesdits réseaux sont celles-là qui participent aux compétitions sportives. Aussi, dans ce cadre, écartent-elles les autres parties intéressées par les activités sportives, et parviennent, de ce fait, à atténuer les conflits entre elles-mêmes.
En conséquence, selon nous, la forte immixtion de l’État dans les affaires fédérales et le principe de cooptation dans le choix des dirigeants sportifs doivent connaître leur épilogue car ils conditionnent l’effectivité de l’autonomie du mouvement sportif sénégalais.
Source de tensions, le financement du mouvement sportif doit évoluer et tendre vers des modèles d’autofinancement adossés au spectacle sportif ou générés par les organisations sportives elles-mêmes. Le financement public impose des contreparties et est limité.
Enfin, les réseaux trans-organisationnels, qui permettent aux acteurs du mouvement sportif d’être au ministère des Sports, créent des connivences et des complicités qui limitent les conflits.",Conflits État du Sénégal et fédérations sportives : une étude diagnostique le mal et propose des remèdes,home page
"Les footballeurs font partie des sportifs les mieux payés dans la plupart des régions du monde.
La triste réalité, cependant, est que les expériences de retraite de nombreux anciens footballeurs professionnels ont été désastreuses. La presse sportive a rapporté des cas de footballeurs autrefois de fotballeurs riches qui ont fait faillite peu de temps après leur départ à la retraite. Au Ghana, les anciens joueurs des Black Stars Sammy Adjei, John Naawu, Joe Odoi, Prince Addu Poku et Amusa Gbadamoshie en sont des exemples notables.
Selon certains universitaires, cette situation regrettable s'explique en partie par le fait que le risque de tomber dans le vide professionnel est élevé. En effet, comme la plupart des sports, le football confère des compétences qui ne sont pas facilement transférables à des emplois non sportifs. L'offre d'emplois dans le football est également très limitée. Ainsi, la plupart des footballeurs gagnent un revenu très élevé pendant leur carrière active et sont confrontés à un degré élevé d'incertitude en termes de revenus au moment de la retraite.
Le mode de vie des footballeurs (pendant la période active et à la retraite) a également été mis en évidence par plusieurs rapports comme étant l'un des facteurs de la situation financière désastreuse dans laquelle certains footballeurs se sont retrouvés.
Là encore, des cas de footballeurs ayant adopté un comportement financier irresponsable ont été signalés. A titre d'exemples, il y a notamment les jeux de hasard, les dépenses somptuaires pour des marques de luxe, les fêtes somptueuses et, d'une manière générale, le maintien d'un style de vie coûteux et insoutenable. Un manque de connaissances financières a souvent été associé à ce type de comportement financier.
Je suis un professeur de comptabilité qui, avec d'autres, a mené une étude pour étudier le niveau de connaissances financières des footballeurs professionnels au Ghana et vérifier son impact sur leur comportement financier et leur bien-être financier.
Nous avons constaté de faibles niveaux d'éducation aux finances et un comportement financier médiocre chez les footballeurs. Les résultats suggèrent que pour promouvoir un comportement financier responsable chez les footballeurs, il est essentiel d'améliorer leurs connaissances financières. Nous avons trouvé un soutien très fort à l'argument selon lequel un comportement financier responsable, représenté dans cette étude par le comportement en matière d'épargne et d'investissement est essentiel pour atteindre le bien-être financier dans la vie.
La conception de l'étude
La culture financière a été décrite comme la capacité à utiliser les connaissances et les compétences nécessaires pour gérer efficacement ses ressources financières afin d'améliorer son bien-être à l'avenir.
Le comportement financier, quant à lui, peut être décrit comme la “capacité à réguler la planification, la budgétisation, la vérification, la gestion, le contrôle, la recherche et l'accumulation des fonds quotidiens”. Il couvre les habitudes de dépense et d'épargne, les habitudes d'emprunt, l'établissement d'un budget et l'accès aux produits financiers.
À l'aide de questionnaires, nous avons interrogé 300 footballeurs qui ont participé à l'édition 2020 de la Ghana Premier League.
Le questionnaire comportait deux sections : l'une sur les données démographiques des personnes interrogées, l'autre sur leurs connaissances financières, leurs comportements financiers et leur bien-être financier.
Actuellement, la Ghana Premier League compte 18 clubs enregistrés. Au moment de l'étude, ces clubs employaient 480 footballeurs inscrits. Par rapport aux clubs d'Europe, d'Angleterre, d'Asie et même de nombreuses autres régions d'Afrique, la valeur nette des clubs ghanéens est très faible. Les revenus des transferts internationaux - une source de financement importante pour la plupart des clubs ghanéens - ont été très faibles au fil des ans. Par exemple, la Fédération internationale de football association (FIFA), dans son rapport 2021 sur les transferts internationaux, a indiqué que les clubs de football ghanéens ont réalisé un bénéfice net de seulement 50 millions de dollars américains au cours de la dernière décennie.
Les finances des footballeurs
Notre étude a révélé que la population des footballeurs était en grande partie jeune. Près de 90 % d'entre eux avaient 30 ans ou moins, ce qui est similaire aux footballeurs d'autres pays. Cela est normal, car les footballeurs sont surtout actifs dans la force de l'âge. Près de 86 % des personnes interrogées avaient un certain niveau d'éducation, principalement jusqu'à la fin du secondaire. La majorité des personnes interrogées étaient mariées et près de 58 % d'entre elles avaient trois personnes à charge ou plus en dehors de leur famille nucléaire. Ainsi, la plupart des footballeurs étaient des soutiens de famille, même si 39 % d'entre eux ont déclaré vivre avec leurs parents ou des amis. En moyenne, ces footballeurs gagnaient 200 cedis ghanéens de revenu mensuel net (177 USD au moment de l'étude), ce qui, comparé à d'autres professionnels, est faible.
Dans l'ensemble, nous avons constaté que les footballeurs avaient un faible niveau d'éducation aux finances. Ils ont accordé une grande importance à la définition d'objectifs à long terme, mais leur intérêt pour la recherche de connaissances financières était très faible. Il n'est donc pas surprenant que la plupart des footballeurs semblent ne pas savoir où leur argent a été dépensé.
Nous avons constaté que les footballeurs n'avaient généralement pas un comportement financier responsable. Très peu d'entre eux s'intéressaient à des produits tels que les obligations, les actions, les fonds communs de placement et les polices d'assurance. En revanche, ils semblaient s'efforcer de comparer les prix lorsqu'ils achetaient un produit ou un service dans un magasin.
Il est intéressant de noter que les footballeurs sont optimistes quant à leur bien-être financier. La plupart des personnes interrogées sont confiantes dans leur capacité à répondre à leurs besoins financiers actuels, ont une vision très positive de leurs besoins financiers futurs et font des choix pour profiter de la vie. Le footballeur moyen espère toujours obtenir des contrats lucratifs à l'avenir.
De meilleures performances
Les efforts visant à améliorer le bien-être financier des footballeurs peuvent commencer par l'investissement dans des programmes de formation destinés à leur donner des connaissances financières. Ensuite, les clubs de football peuvent engager des coachs financiers pour fournir des conseils pratiques aux joueurs pendant leur période d'activité afin de les aider à façonner leur comportement financier.
Étant donné que le bien-être financier est étroitement associé au bien-être psychologique, de telles initiatives pourraient avoir un effet positif sur les performances des joueurs sur le terrain.",Football et gros sous : ce que des joueurs professionnels ghanéens nous ont dit sur la gestion de leurs finances,Null
"La noix de cola est cultivée pour ses graines. L'arbre est originaire d'Afrique de l'Ouest, où il est largement cultivé. On le trouve également en Asie, en Amérique du Sud et dans les Caraïbes.
La production mondiale de noix de cola
La production mondiale de noix de cola était d'environ 311 331 tonnes en 2021. Plus de 90 % de la production mondiale de noix de cola provient d'Afrique de l'Ouest , soit 50 % du Nigeria, 27 % du Cameroun, 16 % de la Côte d'Ivoire et 8 % du Ghana.
Les espèces les plus populaires sont Cola nitida (connue en Afrique de l'Ouest sous le nom de gbànja dans la langue Yòrùbá ; oji en Igbo ; gworo en Hausa) et Cola acuminata (àbàtà, Yòrùbá).
La noix de cola contient des substances chimiques naturelles qui agissent comme un stimulant lorsqu'elle est consommée. Elle fait partie de la culture et des traditions de certains Nigérians. Par exemple, elle est offerte en signe d'hospitalité chez les Igbo. Les Yòrùbá l'utilisent pour la divination et les cérémonies. Les Hausa la mâchent pour réduire la faim.
Les parties de la plante sont largement utilisées dans la médecine populaire, pour traiter le surpoids, les douleurs, la toux, le paludisme, la stérilité, la dysenterie, la fièvre typhoïde, l'herpès, les rhumatismes, l'arthrite et diverses infections. Elle est riche en composés phytochimiques – composés produits par les plantes.
Les noix sont également utilisées comme agents aromatiques et incorporées dans les boissons énergisantes et les produits pharmaceutiques.
Au cours des dix dernières années, nos recherches se sont concentrées sur d'autres utilisations potentielles du cola. Nous avons testé différentes parties de l'arbre - sa graine, sa coque, sa gousse et sa feuille - dans notre laboratoire d'Ogbomoso, dans l'ouest du Nigeria.
Nos expériences ont montré que, grâce à la biotechnologie et à la nanotechnologie, il existe de nouvelles utilisations potentielles dans des domaines tels que l'agriculture et la santé.
Biotechnologie et nanotechnologie
La biotechnoligie utilise des organismes vivants pour fabriquer différents produits. Par exemple, la levure est un organisme vivant utilisé pour produire du pain.
La nanotechnologie permet de fabriquer et d'utiliser des structures, des dispositifs et des systèmes en contrôlant la forme et la taille à l'échelle nanométrique. Un nanomètre est un milliardième de mètre. Elle a des applications dans l'agriculture, l'industrie, la médecine, l'environnement et les produits de consommation.
Notre laboratoire utilise les deux technologies.
Par exemple, nous avons utilisé des nanoparticules pour améliorer le rendement de l'acide citrique par la moisissure noire dans un milieu de jus de pomme de cajou. Notre groupe de recherche en nanotechnologie a également fait la première tentative de production de nanotextiles à partir du coton et de la soie au Nigeria. Nous avons utilisé des nanoparticules d'argent et d'oxyde de titane argenté produites à partir d'eaux usées de haricots de caroube pour modifier le tissu. La caroube est une légumineuse arborescente polyvalente que l'on trouve au Nigeria et dans d'autres régions d'Afrique.
Nos expériences ont également montré que les nanoparticules produites à partir de la noix de cola peuvent être appliquées à l'agriculture, à l'environnement et aux soins de santé.
Appliquer les technologies à la noix de cola
Depuis 2015, nous utilisons la noix de cola pour produire différents types de nanoparticules. Il s'agit notamment de nanoparticules d'argent synthétisées par la gousse, la graine et de la coque de la graine et des nanoparticules d'alliage.
Les autres nanoparticules synthétisées sont le dioxyde de titane, l’alliage titane-argent, le calcium et l’oxyde de magnésium.
Nous avons découvert que la noix de cola fournissait des substances chimiques qui catalysaient la formation de nanoparticules. Les nanoparticules ont été actives contre les bactéries et les champignons pathogènes, ont empêché la coagulation du sang et dégradaient certains colorants. Certaines d'entre elles ont également favorisé la croissance des légumes et le Moringa.
Dans une publication récente, nous avons passé en revue les façons dont la noix de cola peut être utilisée pour produire des biocarburants, des colorants et des aliments pour animaux. D'autres utilisations sont la production de nanomatériaux, d'enzymes, de biofertilisants, de charbon actif et de pesticides. Leurs extraits offrent également une protection contre la corrosion des métaux.
La noix de cola au service du développement durable
Nous avons détaillé l'importance de la noix de cola dans la catalyse, les énergies renouvelables, la technologie d'adsorption, l'inhibition de la corrosion, la technologie des aliments pour animaux et la nanobiotechnologie. Ces produits peuvent être utilisés pour atteindre les objectifs de développement durable : élimination de la faim, énergie propre et abordable, eau propre et assainissement, santé et bien-être, industrie, innovation et infrastructure.
Dans notre dernier article, nous affirmons qu'il est possible de transformer les matériaux inutilisés et les déchets issus de la transformation de la noix de cola en nouveaux produits en utilisant des processus respectueux de l'environnement.
Le Nigeria génère chaque année environ 90 000 tonnes de déchets de gousses et de coques provenant de la transformation de la noix de cola. Nos recherches montrent que ces déchets peuvent être utilisés pour fabriquer des produits importants.

Nos recherches ont montré que la noix de cola recèle un potentiel considérable. Les déchets de sa transformation sont une “mine d'or” qui pourrait être utilisée pour créer de la richesse en générant des produits de valeur. La culture de la noix de cola au Nigeria devrait être développée à cette fin. De nouvelles variétés à haut rendement sont nécessaires pour augmenter la productivité. Cela permettra de créer des ressources matérielles qui pourront être utilisées dans les domaines de la biotechnologie, de la catalyse et de la nanotechnologie afin de contribuer à l'économie du pays.",Noix de cola - du nanofertilisant à la protection des métaux contre la corrosion : notre recherche trouve de nouvelles utilisations pour cette plante précieuse,Null
"Alors que la crise entre Israël et le Hamas se poursuit, l'Égypte fait l'objet d'une attention toute particulière. L'Égypte a une frontière commune avec Israël et Gaza, l'étroite bande de territoire palestinien qui fait actuellement l'objet d'un blocus à la suite de la violente attaque du Hamas contre Israël, une organisation islamiste radicale qui contrôle Gaza depuis 2007. _ Moina Spooner, de The Conversation Africa, a demandé à Ofir Winter, qui étudie la politique égyptienne et le conflit israélo-arabe, de donner des éclairages sur ce que signifie cette nouvelle guerre pour l'Egypte et le rôle qu'elle joue._
Quelles ont été les relations entre l'Égypte, Israël et la Palestine dans le passé ?
L'Égypte joue un rôle d'équilibriste dans la gestion des relations entre Israël et la Palestine.
L'Égypte exprime ouvertement son engagement en faveur de la cause palestinienne. En effet, la quête d'autodétermination de la Palestine est une cause arabe et islamique centrale. De plus, en raison de la proximité géographique, toute escalade à Gaza aura un impact direct sur les intérêts nationaux de l'Égypte.
Cette position se reflète dans sa réaction à la flambée de violence entre Israël et le Hamas. Après les meurtres et les enlèvements meurtriers de civils israéliens innocents par le Hamas au début du mois, les membres du parlement et les médias publics égyptiens ont présenté Israël comme l'agresseur et le Hamas comme la victime.
Conformément aux évènements précédents, on peut s'attendre à ce que l'Égypte prenne plusieurs mesures pour manifester sa solidarité avec les Palestiniens. Il s'agit notamment de la fourniture d'une aide humanitaire à Gaza, de l'évacuation de certains blessés vers des hôpitaux égyptiens et d'un rôle accru dans les efforts de médiation en vue d'un cessez-le-feu. Ces mesures font de l'Égypte un acteur clé dans le conflit et contribueraient à renforcer sa position régionale et internationale.
Cependant, l'Égypte ne veut pas non plus s'aliéner Israël. En fin de compte, les deux pays ont un intérêt commun : ils ne veulent pas voir la résurgence de l'islam politique dans la région. Cela est lié à la propre expérience de l'Égypte en matière d'organisations islamistes.
Le régime actuel de l'Égypte a évincé les Frères musulmans en 2013 et les a mis hors la loi. La confrérie est une organisation islamiste transnationale, fondée en Égypte en 1928. Ses objectifs sont de promouvoir le changement social et politique dans les pays à majorité musulmane. Après le printemps arabe en 2011, la confrérie a détenu le pouvoir en Égypte pendant un an avant d'être évincée.
Le Hamas est issu des Frères musulmans, c'est pourquoi l'Égypte le perçoit comme une menace.
Mais malgré la méfiance de l'Égypte à l'égard du Hamas, il existe depuis 2017 un accord entre les deux pays : la coopération du Hamas dans la lutte contre le terrorisme dans le Sinaï serait assortie d'un assouplissement du blocus égyptien sur la bande de Gaza.
Bien que la nature des relations entre l'Égypte et Israël soient conciliantes, elles ne sont pas chaleureuses. L'Égypte a signé un un accord de paix avec Israël en 1979. Au cours de la dernière décennie, Israël s'est positionné comme un partenaire politique, sécuritaire et économique clé de l'Égypte.
Ces dernières années, l'Égypte a joué un rôle de médiateur entre Israël et le Hamas et dans les efforts de reconstruction de Gaza. Cela s'explique par sa proximité avec Gaza et par le fait qu'elle contrôle le point de passage de Rafah, la seule frontière avec la bande de Gaza qui ne soit pas sous contrôle israélien.
Mais l'implication de l'Égypte dans la bande de Gaza est soumise à certaines limites qui ne seront pas franchies.
Il n'y aura pas d'engagement militaire égyptien contre Israël au profit des Palestiniens, une politique qui découle principalement de l'engagement de l'Égypte envers l'accord de paix de 1979 entre Israël et l'Égypte.

Cela s'explique par sa proximité avec Gaza et par le fait qu'elle contrôle le point de passage de Rafah, la seule frontière avec la bande de Gaza qui ne soit pas sous contrôle israélien.
Il n'y aura pas non plus d'entrée massive de Gazaouis en Égypte, selon les déclarations du président Abdel Fattah el-Sisi et d'autres responsables égyptiens.

Comment la crise actuelle affecte-t-elle l'Égypte ?
L'Égypte a jusqu'à présent rejeté l'idée que des Palestiniens déplacés s'installent dans le Sinaï. Mais il est possible qu'un grand nombre de Gazaouis cherchent à entrer dans le pays. Cette situation est distincte de celle des habitants de Gaza de nationalité étrangère qui attendent à la frontière pour traverser.
L'Égypte s'oppose à ce que les habitants de Gaza franchissent la frontière en grand nombre, car elle s'oppose à tout empiètement sur sa souveraineté dans la péninsule du Sinaï. Elle craint surtout que les Palestiniens déplacés n'établissent une résidence permanente sur son territoire, ce qui risquerait de compromettre une situation sécuritaire et économique déjà délicate.
La situation représente également un risque important pour la sécurité de l'Égypte.
Tout d'abord, les violations de frontières par des réfugiés de Gaza, dont certains peuvent être des individus armés affiliés au Hamas ou à d'autres groupes radicaux, pourraient exporter l'instabilité dans le Sinaï. Pour l'Égypte, il existe un risque de voir se multiplier les attaques terroristes et l'instabilité, comme c'était le cas dans le Sinaï avant l'accord de 2017 avec le Hamas. Certains de ces attentats ont été perpétrés par des cellules militantes bien armées et entraînées basées à Gaza.
Deuxièmement, un coup dur porté au Hamas pourrait entraîner un manque de gouvernance, le chaos et l'instabilité à Gaza. Cette instabilité pourrait donner lieu à la contrebande d'armes et de combattants le long de la frontière entre l'Égypte et la bande de Gaza.
L'autre menace pour la sécurité est que des actes terroristes pourraient être lancés depuis le Sinaï vers Israël par des groupes militants palestiniens, ce qui mettrait en péril les relations délicates entre Israël et l'Égypte.
Comment l'Égypte a-t-elle réagi et que doit-elle faire maintenant ?
Depuis le début de la guerre, l'Égypte s'efforce de désamorcer la situation à Gaza et mène des pourparlers avec Israël, le Hamas, l'Autorité palestinienne, les États-Unis, l'Iran et d'autres acteurs régionaux et internationaux.
La Ligue arabe s'est déjà réunie au Caire et une conférence internationale devrait avoir lieu en Égypte le 20 octobre. L'Egypte cherche également à établir un corridor humanitaire pour l'acheminement de nourriture et de médicaments vers la bande de Gaza.
À ce stade, l'Égypte a plus de contrôle que la plupart des autres acteurs internationaux régionaux sur l'issue du conflit, et a beaucoup d'intérêts à préserver.
L'issue du conflit pourrait apporter certains avantages. Par exemple, l'Égypte souhaite le retour de l'Autorité palestinienne, qui est plus disposée à s'engager dans la diplomatie et les négociations, en tant qu'autorité dirigeante à Gaza. Un scénario dans lequel le Hamas serait considérablement affaibli pourrait ouvrir la voie à de nouveaux développements, incluant éventuellement le retour progressif de l'Autorité palestinienne. Dans ce cas, l'Égypte et Israël pourraient trouver un voisin plus pragmatique de l'autre côté de leurs frontières.
Si le Hamas perd le pouvoir à la fin de la guerre, l'Égypte sera très probablement impliquée dans la phase de transition gouvernementale. Comme au cours des dernières années, l'Égypte devrait être le canal par lequel l'aide et les fonds des pays arabes et de la communauté internationale seront transférés à Gaza, participer à son processus de reconstruction et être un facteur d'influence dominant pour façonner son avenir.",Conflit Hamas-Israël : les enjeux pour l'Égypte,Null
"Le prestigieux Prix Caine 2023 pour l'écriture africaine a été remporté par un couple d'écrivains sénégalais. Leur nouvelle _Une âme des petits endroits (que l'on peut lire ici (en anglais)) fait écho à des tendances plus profondes dans la littérature du pays tout en s'inscrivant dans la montée en puissance du genre de l'horreur et de la fiction spéculative sur le continent.Spécialiste de la littérature africaine, Caroline D. Laurent explique._
Qu'est-ce que le Prix Caine et que signifie le fait de le remporter ?
Le Prix Caine, décerné chaque année depuis 2000, récompense une nouvelle écrite en anglais par un auteur africain. Son objectif est de faire connaître la littérature africaine à un plus grand nombre de lecteurs. Il est nommé en l'honneur de Sir Michael Harris Caine, cofondateur du Man Booker Prize. Il consiste tout d'abord en un prix de 10 000 livres sterling pour le(s) lauréat(s). L'obtention de ce prix permet aux écrivains de discuter de leur travail, d'échanger avec d'autres écrivains, de rencontrer la presse et de publier leur travail dans l'anthologie du prix Caine, tout cela dans la perspective de gagner en reconnaissance. Il sert souvent de tremplin pour d'autres publications. Il a contribué à lancer la carrière d'écrivains tels que les romanciers nigérians Helon Habila et Tope Folarin, la romancière zimbabwéenne NoViolet Bulawayo et la Zambienne Namwali Serpell.
Qui sont les lauréats de cette année ?
Les lauréats de cette année sont un duo d'écrivains sénégalais, Woppa Diallo et Mame Bougouma Diene. Woppa Diallo est une juriste et militante féministe qui, à l'âge de 15 ans, a fondé l'Association pour le maintien des filles à l'école à Matam au Sénégal. Son travail a servi d'inspiration pour l'histoire primée, d'où le nom de la protagoniste principale, Woppa Diallo.
Diene est un écrivain et un humanitaire américain franco-sénégalais. Il est le porte-parole francophone de la African Speculative Fiction Society et contribue en tant que chroniqueur à Strange Horizons, un magazine de fiction spéculative en ligne. Son premier recueil Dark Moons Rising on a Starless Night a été nominé pour deux Splatterpunk Awards en 2019. Il mélange souvent des éléments d'horreur, des questions sociales et des croyances locales dans son œuvre. A Soul of Small Places (Une âme des petits endroits, en français) est un exemple de ses genres de prédilection.
De quoi parle l'histoire ?
Une âme pour des petits endroits raconte l'histoire de Woppa, une jeune fille qui vit dans la ville rurale de Matam au Sénégal. Woppa a pour mission de protéger sa jeune sœur Awa sur le chemin de l'école. En effet, les filles qui vont à l'école sont souvent la proie d'hommes qui les agressent sexuellement et les contraignent à des mariages précoces. La peur quotidienne de Woppa et Awa sur le chemin de l'école met en évidence le manque de réaction des autorités et des citoyens. La violence fondée sur le genre reste entourée de silence, étouffée par des sentiments de honte et de culpabilité. D'où l'intervention du Soukounio, un djinn dévoreur de chair qui, dans ce récit, joue le rôle de protecteur et de vengeur des jeunes filles. Devant tant d'indifférence, seuls les dieux peuvent protéger les filles de Matam.
Pourquoi est-ce si bon ?
Une âme pour des petits endroits est une nouvelle magnifiquement écrite qui a été décrite avec justesse par les juges du prix Caine comme “tendre et poétique”. Mais c'est aussi un récit poignant et frustrant. Le pouvoir de la littérature de se concentrer sur les individus et leurs expériences personnelles donne un visage humain à un problème social non résolu. L'utilisation habile du suspense et de l'horreur par les auteurs pour transmettre cette idée laisse un impact profond sur le lecteur, dans l'espoir de l'inciter à réfléchir à la question et à agir.
Read more: Mohamed Mbougar Sarr: Senegalese novelist's win is a landmark for African literature
Le récit de Diallo et Diene est profondément ancré dans son contexte local. Matam est décrit comme le deuxième endroit le plus chaud du Sénégal et la chaleur est palpable dans la description du paysage, où la nature est à la fois menaçante et protectrice. Les références à différents dieux et esprits soulignent également l'environnement dans lequel Woppa et sa famille vivent. Cependant, cette nouvelle peut également résonner avec les peurs ressenties par les jeunes filles et les femmes dans le monde entier. L'anxiété des filles qui rentrent chez elles après le coucher du soleil est une expérience vécue par de nombreuses femmes. Une âme pour des petits endroits dépeint des expériences qui, malheureusement, ne sont que trop universelles. L'absence de réponses adéquates résonne également, quel que soit l'endroit où l'on vit.
Qu'est-ce que cela dit de la fiction sénégalaise ?
Récemment, la fiction sénégalaise a abordé des questions importantes au Sénégal, qu'il s'agisse de l'homophobie - comme dans De purs hommes de Mohamed Mbougar Sarr - ou de la violence sexuelle basée sur le genre, comme dans Une âme de petits endroits.
Read more: New Kiswahili science fiction award charts a path for African languages
Il convient également de noter que Diallo et Diene ont écrit leur histoire en anglais, et non en français, la langue des anciens colonisateurs du Sénégal. Le choix d'écrire en anglais permet de démanteler l'utilisation néocoloniale des langues en fonction de l'origine et du passé colonial du pays. En ce sens, l'anglais apparaît davantage comme une langue mondiale. Le Kiswahili Prize for African Literature, où les auteurs écrivent en langues africaines, complète le prix Caine. Le fait que les langues soient réparties de cette manière atteste du dynamisme de la littérature africaine, qui remet en question l'utilisation des langues des anciens colonisateurs de différentes manières.
La littérature sénégalaise joue un rôle essentiel en encourageant les gens à lire, à réfléchir et à s'engager sur des questions importantes pour le pays. La littérature est un outil de reconnaissance, de compréhension et d'action. Une âme des petits endroits en est un exemple magnifique et terrifiant.",Prix Caine 2023 : des écrivains sénégalais remportent le prix pour un récit d'horreur sur les dangers auxquels sont confrontées les jeunes filles,Null
"Le siège de la bande de Gaza, décrété par Israël après l’attaque dévastatrice du Hamas le 7 octobre dernier, a suscité l’inquiétude au Caire. L’Égypte partage avec Gaza une frontière de 12 km et contrôle le point de passage de Rafah, qui est la principale voie de sortie pour les quelque 2 millions de personnes vivant dans la bande de Gaza.
Moina Spooner, de The Conversation Africa, a interrogé le sociologue Lorenzo Navone, qui a effectué de nombreux travaux de recherche au cours des dix dernières années, sur l’importance de ce poste-frontière qui, à ce stade, demeure fermé.
Que représente le poste-frontière de Rafah pour l’Égypte et pour la bande de Gaza ?
La région orientale de l’Égypte, le Sinaï, est limitrophe à la fois d’Israël et de Gaza. C’est entre le Sinaï et Gaza que se trouve, à Rafah, l’un des deux principaux postes-frontière à travers lesquels les Gazaouis peuvent sortir de la bande – et le seul qui n’est pas directement administré par Israël.
C’est une ouverture vitale pour la survie des habitants de Gaza. Depuis 2007, Israël impose à la bande de Gaza un blocus terrestre, maritime et aérien, doublé d’un embargo. Cette mesure fait suite au retrait des Israéliens de la bande de Gaza en 2005 et à la victoire du Hamas aux élections de 2006.
Dans les faits, l’Égypte a soutenu et continue de soutenir le blocus israélien. En effet, la frontière de Rafah est étroitement contrôlée par les forces égyptiennes, et ne s’ouvre que de manière imprévisible et ponctuelle.
La bande de Gaza et ses environs. Cliquer pour zoomer. PeterHermesFurian/GettyImages
Gaza dépend entièrement de l’aide humanitaire internationale, du travail des quelques Palestiniens autorisés à travailler en Israël et des tunnels creusés sous la frontière entre l’Égypte et la bande de Gaza. Pour l’Égypte comme pour Israël, ces tunnels constituent une menace car ils peuvent être utilisés pour la contrebande d’armes et l’infiltration de terroristes.
Le blocus a eu un impact dramatique sur la vie des habitants de Gaza. Ils n’ont pas accès aux droits fondamentaux, notamment à la nourriture, à l’éducation, à l’emploi et à la santé.
Depuis près de 20 ans, la bande de Gaza est, selon l’expression consacrée, une prison à ciel ouvert. Le poste de Rafah revêt donc une importance considérable pour les Palestiniens, car il constitue l’un des rares points d’accès pour la circulation des personnes, des marchandises et de l’aide humanitaire aussi bien vers Gaza que depuis Gaza. Il permet aux Palestiniens de maintenir des liens vitaux avec le monde extérieur et d’accéder à des ressources essentielles. Son fonctionnement joue un rôle essentiel dans l’atténuation des difficultés auxquelles les habitants sont confrontés en permanence.
Qu’implique pour Rafah l’enchaînement des événements que l’on a observé depuis le 7 octobre dernier ?
Le déclenchement de la guerre actuelle entre, d’une part, Israël et, d’autre part, le Hamas et d’autres factions palestiniennes, met en lumière trois éléments essentiels :
l’importance du point de passage de Rafah pour la stabilité de la région et pour les Palestiniens de Gaza ;
l’expulsion potentielle des Palestiniens de Gaza ;
et l’ambiguïté de la posture de l’Égypte à l’égard du peuple palestinien.
Tout d’abord, bien que le poste-frontière de Rafah soit le seul moyen de quitter la bande de Gaza, il est fermé plus souvent qu’il n’est ouvert depuis près de 20 ans. Or n’oubliez pas qu’un poste-frontière doit a priori fonctionner 24 heures sur 24 et 7 jours sur 7.
Les ouvertures étaient sporadiques et les conditions de délivrance d’une autorisation de passage étaient peu claires. On ne sait pas non plus qui gère le point de passage et qui décide de son ouverture.
Ces dernières années, les habitants de Gaza ont très largement dépendu, pour leur subsistance, du fonctionnement du point de passage de Rafah et des tunnels. C’est encore plus vrai aujourd’hui : il s’agit d’une véritable ligne de vie pour eux dans le contexte actuel.
Deuxièmement, une ouverture humanitaire du point de passage signifierait probablement l’arrivée en Égypte de milliers de Palestiniens déplacés. Mais l’Égypte ne sera pas disposée à les accueillir car elle craint qu’ils restent sur son territoire de manière permanente.
Enfin, la question de la difficulté à accepter les Palestiniens fuyant Gaza met en évidence la position ambiguë de l’Égypte à leur égard. Parmi les pays arabes limitrophes d’Israël et des territoires palestiniens occupés, l’Égypte est le seul à ne pas avoir autorisé l’établissement de camps de réfugiés palestiniens sur son territoire, contrairement à la Syrie qui accueille plus de 500 000 réfugiés, à la Jordanie qui en accueille 2 millions, et au Liban qui en accueille plus de 200 000.
Dans leurs discours officiels, les autorités égyptiennes s’opposent à l’expulsion des Palestiniens de Gaza et les soutiennent dans leur lutte visant à obtenir un État souverain.
Mais l’Égypte est un pays surpeuplé à l’économie fragile qui refuse de voir un afflux de personnes pauvres sur son territoire. Depuis 1948, on estime (bien que ces chiffres fassent l’objet de débats) qu’il y a environ 80 000 Palestiniens qui résident en Égypte. La plupart d’entre eux n’ont pas de droits civiques et vivent en dehors de tout cadre de protection juridique et humanitaire.
Que devrait faire l’Égypte, compte tenu de la complexité de la situation ?
Au moment où nous parlons, la situation est très volatile, mais je crois que l’Égypte ne gère rien du tout : en fait, elle apparaît plutôt comme un spectateur passif des événements en cours.
Si l’on exclut le scénario, très improbable, d’une intervention militaire égyptienne pour stopper l’assaut israélien sur Gaza (ce qui pourrait déboucher sur une guerre régionale de grande ampleur), l’Égypte n’a que deux options.
Premièrement, utiliser toutes les voies diplomatiques à sa disposition pour négocier un cessez-le-feu. Ce sera extrêmement compliqué car Israël perçoit la bande de Gaza et tous ses habitants (y compris les mineurs, les femmes et les personnes âgées) comme une menace existentielle, ce qui signifie qu’il n’a pas l’intention de suspendre la guerre ni d’écouter qui que ce soit.
Deuxièmement, fournir une aide humanitaire aux personnes déplacées à l’intérieur de la bande de Gaza en empruntant des corridors sûrs. Israël a coupé l’électricité, le gaz, l’Internet et l’eau à Gaza avant son assaut. Gaza est donc actuellement en proie à une panne totale d’électricité et à la famine.
À l’heure actuelle, le principal risque, que l’Égypte doit garder à l’esprit au moment de prendre sa décision, est celui d’un nombre de pertes humaines colossal parmi la population gazaouie.","Le poste-frontière de Rafah : pour les Gazaouis, une issue de secours qui reste close",home page
"Les risques climatiques peuvent être complexes à gérer car ils ne respectent pas les frontières des pays. Les risques dans une région peuvent avoir des répercussions négatives dans une autre. C'est ce que l'on appelle les risques climatiques transfrontaliers, qui sont de plus en plus préoccupants. Ils nécessitent des réponses coordonnées et multinationales. Ce qui peut s'avérer difficile compte tenu des priorités et des capacités différentes de chaque pays.
Un risque climatique transfrontalier peut être dû à un écosystème partagé, tel qu'un bassin fluvial. Par exemple, le Nil, qui traverse 11 pays, peut connaître des variations dans la disponibilité de l'eau en raison de changements météorologiques. Les millions de personnes qui en dépendent en seront affectées.
Les risques climatiques transfrontaliers peuvent également traverser les continents et les océans et engendrer des crises à l'autre bout du monde. Il peut s'agir de pénuries de nourriture et d'eau, de menaces pour le commerce et l’énergie, d'une aggravation des inégalités, de migrations forcées et même de conflits géopolitiques.
Par exemple, une sécheresse en Afrique de l'Est pourrait affecter la production de thé au Kenya. Cela entraînerait une augmentation des prix pour les consommateurs de thé dans les pays importateurs, comme le Royaume-Uni. De même, un typhon pourrait affecter les fabricants en Asie du Sud-Est. Cela pourrait perturber l'approvisionnement des marchés africains en produits électroniques et entraîner des hausses de prix ou des pénuries.
L'Afrique est particulièrement vulnérable. Les routes commerciales, les chaînes d'approvisionnement et les écosystèmes partagés s'étendent sur tout le continent. Une perturbation induite par le climat dans un pays peut facilement avoir des effets en cascade chez ses voisins. La gestion coordonnée des risques climatiques transfrontaliers est à la fois un défi et une nécessité.
Lors du récent Sommet africain sur le climat au Kenya, l'Union africaine et d'autres parties prenantes africaines ont présenté la Feuille de route pour la résilience de l'Afrique pour y remédier.
Cette feuille de route contient une série d'actions destinées à renforcer la coordination entre les communautés économiques régionales et les États membres dans la gestion des risques climatiques transfrontaliers et en cascade. Il s'agit d'un objectif de la Stratégie et plan d'action sur le changement climatique et le développement résilient 2022-2032 de l'Union africaine.
Historiquement, les efforts d'adaptation ont largement porté sur les impacts localisés, tels que l'élévation du niveau de la mer et les communautés côtières ou les sécheresses fréquentes et leur impact sur les rendements agricoles.
En tant qu’expert en matière d'adaptation au changement climatique, je pense que l'importance de cette feuille de route réside dans son approche globale, à l'échelle du continent. Elle reconnaît que des défis communs nécessitent des solutions communes. Et elle souligne l'engagement de l'Afrique à prendre en main son destin climatique. C'est ce qui rend cette feuille de route précieuse dans l'évolution du discours sur la résilience climatique mondiale.
Front uni
La feuille de route pour la résilience de l'Afrique présente 25 actions cruciales pour renforcer la résilience de l'Afrique face aux risques climatiques transfrontaliers. Elle met l'accent sur les risques qui pèsent sur les chaînes d'approvisionnement mondiales et sur les marchés de l'énergie et de l'alimentation.
Les actions de la feuille de route peuvent être regroupées en quatre points principaux :
Reconnaître les risques : cela inclut une évaluation à l'échelle continentale des risques climatiques transfrontaliers et le développement d'indicateurs de risques.
Gouverner ensemble : identifier les risques transfrontaliers que chaque pays considère comme les plus importants. Ceux-ci seront inclus dans différents domaines de la politique.
Mettre en œuvre l'adaptation à l'échelle de l'Afrique : mettre en place un plan pour trouver les meilleurs moyens de renforcer les communautés contre les risques climatiques transfrontaliers. Les principes de la résilience juste y sont intégrés, comme la priorité donnée aux besoins des personnes les plus vulnérables et le respect des droits de l'homme et des valeurs culturelles. La feuille de route donne également le coup d'envoi d'un programme visant à mettre ces idées en pratique.
Mobiliser des ressources pour la résilience : obtenir plus d'argent de plusieurs pays pour soutenir l'action climatique, s'assurer que les investissements privés correspondent aux objectifs publics en mettant l'accent sur la résilience systémique, et renforcer la capacité d'investir ensemble.
La feuille de route pour la résilience africaine offre donc une vision holistique et panafricaine. Elle ne se contente pas d'identifier les risques climatiques transfrontaliers, mais propose également une approche structurée pour une action collective.
La mise en œuvre de la feuille de route nécessite la participation active de plusieurs organisations africaines. Il s'agit notamment de la Commission économique des Nations unies pour l'Afrique, de la Commission de l'Union africaine, de l'Agence de développement de l'Union africaine, du Nouveau partenariat pour le développement de l'Afrique, du Groupe africain d'experts en négociation et des Communautés économiques régionales d'Afrique. En outre, les gouvernements nationaux, le secteur privé, la société civile et le monde universitaire jouent un rôle crucial.
Le défi consistera à assurer une action cohérente entre ces entités. D'autant plus que l'adaptation aux risques climatiques est une entreprise relativement nouvelle pour certaines des organisations susmentionnées.
Une étape importante
Le premier Sommet africain sur le climat a marqué une étape importante dans l'engagement collectif de l'Afrique en faveur de la résilience. La feuille de route reconnaît la réalité des destins entremêlés de l'Afrique et la nécessité de solutions collaboratives aux risques climatiques transfrontaliers.
Compte tenu de la nature transfrontalière des risques climatiques, la coopération mondiale doit être au cœur des initiatives d'adaptation.

"Après deux décennies de négociations acharnées, plus de 60 pays ont récemment signé le traité des Nations unies sur les océans visant à préserver la biodiversité en haute mer.
La haute mer est l'ensemble des zones océaniques qui ne sont pas directement détenues ou réglementées par un pays donné. Elles représentent deux tiers des océans et fournissent 90 % de l'habitat disponible pour la vie.
Le traité a été célébré comme historique. Pour la première fois, des mesures sont prises contre l'utilisation non réglementée des ressources dans cet espace non gouverné.
On estime que 90 % des stocks de poissons marins de la planète sont aujourd'hui pleinement exploités, surexploités ou épuisés. Bien que moins de 10 % du total des prises mondiales de poissons proviennent de la haute mer, la nature non réglementée de la pêche a un impact nuisible sur la vie marine.
Le traité est composé de 76 articles. Ses objectifs comprennent la protection et la gestion durable du milieu marin, la préservation de l'intégrité des écosystèmes océaniques, tels que les récifs coralliens, et la conservation de la diversité biologique. Une fois ratifié, le traité permettra la création de aires marines protégées en haute mer.
Bien qu'il n'interdise pas explicitement la pêche commerciale en haute mer, il contient des dispositions permettant leur “utilisation durable”. Ainsi, la création d'une zone protégée en haute mer devrait permettre de lutter contre les activités de pêche non durables dans cet espace, mais seulement si elle est entièrement mise en œuvre.

Une partie de mon expertise porte sur la gouvernance des ressources maritimes et naturelles en Afrique, c'est pourquoi j'ai suivi cette évolution. Il y a des raisons de se réjouir du traité sur les océans pour ce qu'il représente : un mécanisme supplémentaire pour protéger nos océans et leurs ressources. Mais ce qui me préoccupe le plus, et qui a été signalé par d'autres, c'est que le traité pourrait inciter les flottes hauturières (qui pêchent en dehors de leur territoire) à se rapprocher des zones de pêche terrestres. Or, bon nombre des zones les plus lucratives appartiennent à des pays africains.
Le traité a été décrit comme “extrêmement large” et manquant de spécificités. Des règles claires doivent être mises en place par l'agence chargée de la mise en œuvre du traité. On ne sait pas encore qui sera chargé de cette tâche. Le traité demande aux États parties d'autoriser la création de divers comités et groupes de travail, ainsi que d'une conférence des parties chargée de guider la mise en œuvre.
Je soutiens qu'une réglementation claire doit garantir la suppression des subventions à la pêche accordées aux navires qui dépendaient autrefois de la haute mer. Les subventions accordées aux navires hauturiers peuvent encourager la surexploitation des espèces vulnérables.
Des zones de pêche attrayantes
Ayant perdu l'accès au poisson en haute mer, les flottes auront besoin de nouveaux lieux de pêche. Les eaux africaines constituent une cible attrayante pour diverses raisons.
Tout d'abord, elles sont riches en diverses espèces.
Deuxièmement, ces eaux ne sont pas correctement surveillées, ce qui permet aux pays d'en tirer profit. La pêche illégale, non déclarée et non réglementée coûte déjà à l'Afrique plus de 2,3 milliards de dollars par an.
Troisièmement, les États côtiers africains semblent disposés à conclure de nouveaux accords avec des pays qui pêchent en dehors de leurs frontières.
Cette situation est inquiétante car elle va mettre en péril les stocks de poissons vulnérables de l'Afrique. Les navires de pêche en haute mer sont déjà connus pour leur exploitation.
Quels sont ces navires ?
Environ 97 % de la pêche en haute mer est pratiquée par des navires battant pavillon de pays à revenu élevé - la grande majorité (86 %) sont originaires de Chine, de Taïwan, du Japon, de la Corée du Sud et de l'Espagne.
Les navires de certains de ces pays, tels que la Chine, la Corée du Sud et l'Espagne, ont déjà conclu des accords de pêche avec des pays d'Afrique. On sait qu'ils contribuent à la surexploitation du poisson sur le continent par le biais de la pêche légale et illégale.
Des subventions nuisibles
Ces navires de pêche hauturière proviennent des 10 premiers pays qui accordent des subventions à la pêche.
Les subventions à la pêche sont des aides financières accordées par les gouvernements pour aider le secteur privé, y compris les navires de pêche en haute mer, à capturer davantage de poissons. Certaines de ces subventions se sont révélées nuisibles, en particulier pour les espèces vulnérables.
Les subventions nuisibles encouragent la surpêche, car l'argent est dépensé pour des activités d'expansion de la capacité telles que la réduction artificielle des coûts du carburant et de la construction des navires. Cela permet aux grands navires de capturer plus de poissons qu'il n'est possible de le faire durablement en pêchant plus loin en mer et pendant plus longtemps. Sans ces subventions, de nombreuses flottes industrielles ne seraient pas rentables.
Le traité n'aborde pas clairement la question des subventions, mais celles-ci font l'objet de l'accord 2022 de l'Organisation mondiale du commerce Accord sur les subventions à la pêche. Cet accord n'est toutefois pas entré en vigueur, les deux tiers des signataires ne l'ayant pas encore ratifié. Dans le cadre de l'accord proposé, les pays signataires doivent s'engager à cesser d'accorder des subventions préjudiciables.
Si les subventions nuisibles ne sont pas traitées efficacement, l'interdiction de la pêche en haute mer pourrait finir par contribuer à l'augmentation des activités de pêche dans les juridictions des pays côtiers.
Ce qu'il faut faire
Outre la mise en œuvre effective du traité, plusieurs mesures et stratégies peuvent être déployées pour garantir la protection des pays africains.
La communauté internationale doit soutenir davantage les organismes régionaux de pêche - tels que le Comité des pêches pour le centre-ouest du golfe de Guinée et la Commission régionale des pêches pour le golfe de Guinée - pour les pays d'Afrique de l'Ouest. Les organismes régionaux doivent être mieux à même de guider les États membres en matière de pratiques de pêche durables, d'appliquer les réglementations existantes ou de les mettre à jour si nécessaire.
Read more: Fisheries subsidies fuel ocean depletion and hurt coastal communities
La surveillance de la pêche doit bénéficier d'un soutien accru. Les partenaires et les organisations non gouvernementales partagent des données issues de la technologie satellitaire et des systèmes de suivi des navires qui aident les États côtiers à surveiller ce qui se passe dans leurs eaux. La communauté internationale doit apporter un soutien supplémentaire afin que les États côtiers puissent appliquer les réglementations existantes en partageant les capacités, le savoir-faire technologique et les actifs.
En combinant ces stratégies et en encourageant la coopération internationale, il est possible de trouver un équilibre entre la mise en œuvre du traité et la pêche durable dans les océans africains.",Le nouveau traité sur la protection des océans du monde pourrait nuire aux pêcheries africaines vulnérables,Null
"Le dimanche 8 octobre 2023, la guerre au Moyen-Orient a plongé l'humanité dans une tourmente qui a depuis captivé l'attention internationale. Sans cela, le monde serait probablement en pleine effervescence avec les exploits retentissants d'un Kenyan de 23 ans qui a changé l'histoire marathon à Chicago le même jour.
Kelvin Kiptum, qui n'en était qu'à son troisième marathon, a terminé la course de 42,195 kilomètres en 2h 00m 35s. Il a ainsi abaissé de 34 secondes le précédent record du monde établi par son compatriote Eliud Kipchoge à Berlin l'année dernière. C'est la première fois que le record du monde est battu avec plus de 30 secondes de moins depuis que l'approbation officielle a commencé il y a 20 ans. C'est Kipchoge, plus connu, qui s'est le plus rapproché de ce record en 2022, en retranchant 30 secondes à sa propre performance.
Le rythme moyen de Kiptum a été de 21 kilomètres par heure (13,04 mph), soit 2 minutes et 51,5 secondes par kilomètre (4:36.0 min/mile).
En tant que spécialiste de données et économiste (et coureur), je m'intéresse à l'analyse de la progression historique des records du monde de marathon pour les hommes et les femmes.
Les exploits extraordinaires de l'homme peuvent-ils être soumis à une analyse statistique ?
Mon approche consiste à considérer la progression des records du monde de marathon un peu comme l'évolution de la technologie. Dans les deux cas, de nombreux facteurs peuvent conduire à un gain de performance. Dans le cas du marathon, il peut s'agir du régime d'entraînement, de la nutrition, de la préparation psychologique et de l'équipement.
Le 8 octobre, Kiptum n'a pas seulement établi un nouveau record. Il a également changé l'évolution du record du monde du marathon.
D'après mes calculs et mon analyse, il a, selon toute vraisemblance, préparé le terrain pour que le record du marathon “sous les 2 heures” tombe dans les prochaines années. Avant la course de Kiptum, j'étais moins convaincu que ce record tomberait avant la fin de la décennie.
Pourquoi parle-t-on encore de “moins de 2 heures” ?
Kipchoge n'a-t-il pas déjà franchi le cap des “moins de 2 heures” en 2019 ? En fait, pas vraiment.
L'athlétisme est l'un des sports où les records officiels comptent beaucoup. Les parcours doivent être mesurés (trois fois) au centimètre près, les lignes doivent être nettes et claires, les haies doivent être disposées en rangs avec une précision militaire et les athlètes doivent s'accroupir, figés sur place, sans bouger le moindre cheveu, jusqu'à ce que le pistolet du starter retentisse. Il y a tout un règlement établi par l'Association internationale des fédérations d'athlétisme pour qu'un marathon sur route soit qualifié d’“officiel”.
Ainsi, lorsque Kipchoge (soutenu par une équipe financée à hauteur d'un million de dollars) a couru en tant que seul “concurrent” pendant 1h 59m et 40s autour de la Prater Hauptallee à Vienne en octobre 2019, tout le monde, y compris Kipchoge, savait que ce n'était pas la fin de la grande quête d'un record officiel inférieur à 2 heures.
Le record du monde est resté à 2h 1m 39s, le propre record de Kipchoge, établi lors du marathon de Berlin en septembre 2018. Kipchoge a ensuite abaissé son propre record du monde officiel du marathon à 2h 1m 9s en septembre de l'année dernière, également lors du marathon de Berlin.
Et c'est là où le record officiel est resté, jusqu'au 8 octobre.
Que signifie le nouveau record du monde de Kiptum ?
Il y a plusieurs façons de répondre à cette question. Pour les amateurs comme pour les professionnels, il existe de nombreuses façons d'améliorer ses performances. En voici quelques-unes (mais la liste n'est pas exhaustive) :
les choix d'entraînement (volume, intensité, repos, entraînement croisé);
la nutrition (micro- et macro-nutriments, alimentation avant la course, hydratation pendant la course);
formation psychologique (contretemps, anxiété liée à la performance, ennui, motivation, discours personnel);
la technologie de l'équipement en matière de chaussures et de vêtements.
Du point de vue de l'analyse statistique et économique, après avoir formulé quelques hypothèses, nous pouvons nous attendre à ce que l'obtention d'un record du monde dans le marathon suive un modèle défini. À tel point que nous pouvons modéliser les périodes historiques, c'est-à-dire leur appliquer une formule mathématique, et ainsi obtenir des informations sur le présent et le futur.
Les économistes modélisent les performances athlétiques depuis des décennies. Nous savons maintenant que tant que le taux d'arrivée des petites améliorations (pensez à un nouveau supplément, une nouvelle mousse de chaussure ou une nouvelle aide à l'entraînement) dans chaque facteur est à peu près cohérent dans le temps, nous devons nous attendre à ce que le résultat global ait un comportement raisonnablement prévisible. C'est ce processus global que nous pouvons modéliser.
Mon approche consiste à adapter un modèle à la tendance moyenne des records du monde de marathon sur plusieurs décennies, puis à estimer la probabilité de passer en dessous de cette tendance pour courir un temps donné un jour donné.
Tout d'abord, nous pouvons modéliser la progression historique du record du monde masculin comme si nous n'avions pas connaissance du record du monde de Kipchoge en 2022 et de la nouvelle performance de Kiptum. Cela nous indiquera à quel point ces temps étaient inhabituels (ou inattendus), du point de vue de l'histoire.
Ce que nous constatons, c'est que si la course de Kipchoge en ce jour particulier de septembre 2022 (“+” dans la figure ci-dessous) était remarquable, avec une probabilité proche de “1 chance sur 4”, en se fondant sur le passé, la course de Kiptum était, d'un point de vue statistique, plus impressionnante. La course de Kiptum (“x” dans la figure ci-dessous) se situe plus près de la ligne de probabilité “1 sur 10”.

En d'autres termes, la performance de Kiptum est moins attendue (ou plus inhabituelle) que celle de Kipchoge, si l'on se réfère à la ligne de progression historique des records du monde. Et ce, même si l'on tient compte de la progression naturelle du record du monde que l'on peut attendre au cours de l'année qui sépare les deux courses.
Compte tenu de l'excellence de la course de Kipchoge à Berlin 2022, ce n'est pas peu dire.
Kiptum modifie-t-il les attentes concernant les moins de 2 heures ?
Supposons qu'un coureur hypothétique du type de Kiptum se présente sur la ligne de départ des futurs marathons (officiels). Quand passerait-il sous la barre des 2 heures ?
En suivant la ligne “1 sur 10” dans le futur, nous constatons qu'elle franchit la ligne des 2 heures en mai 2032. Ce n'est pas différent de ce que j'ai prédit il y a quatre ans.
Cependant, que se passe-t-il si nous autorisons notre procédure de modélisation à prendre en compte les nouveaux records mondiaux de Kipchoge et de Kiptum en 2022 et 2023 respectivement ?
Lorsque je n'ajoute que la performance de Kipchoge et que je travaille avec un coureur comme Kipchoge avec une probabilité de “1 sur 4”, le moment où l'on passe sous la barre des 2 heures n'évolue pas beaucoup, avançant de quelques mois seulement, à savoir novembre 2031.
Cependant, si nous ajoutons la course plus extraordinaire de Kiptum, quelque chose de remarquable se produit.
Modélisation de la progression historique du record du monde masculin de marathon avec les nouveaux records du monde établis par Kipchoge (2022) et Kiptum (2023). Créé par l'auteur.
Tout d'abord, le modèle apprend à s'adapter un peu plus aux performances de Kiptum. En effet, il devient un peu moins extraordinaire, se rapprochant de la ligne de probabilité actualisée de “1 sur 4”.
Deuxièmement, si nous suivons cette ligne - c'est-à-dire si nous supposons qu'un coureur comme Kiptum est sur la ligne de départ des futurs marathons officiels - nous constatons que l'arrivée d'un marathon en moins de 2 heures a été avancée de cinq ans, à mars 2027.
En effet, Kiptum (et dans une certaine mesure Kipchoge en 2022) a réussi à faire basculer toute l'histoire des records du monde de marathon. C'est juste suffisant pour que le record en moins de 2 heures devienne une réalité probable dans les prochaines années.
D'autres records de moins de 2 heures ?
Ces courbes nous révèlent autre chose. Si nous les prolongeons jusqu'à un avenir très lointain, elles finissent par s'établir sur le temps le plus rapide qu'une personne puisse jamais courir sur le marathon. Les “limites”, si vous voulez, de la performance humaine.
Si nous suivons la “ligne Kiptum” (probabilité de “1 sur 4”), nous constatons qu'elle s'établit à 1h 55m 40s. Environ 2 minutes de plus que ma prédiction pour le même résultat il y a quatre ans. Une fois de plus, Kiptum a marqué les esprits.
S'il y a quelque chose de rassurant dans cette analyse, en particulier pour ceux qui aiment le marathon et cette période de courses incroyables, tant pour les hommes que pour les femmes, même quand (et non pas si) la barre des moins de 2 heures est franchie, la limite est encore à plus de 4 minutes !
En termes de haute performance, même si quelqu'un passe sous la barre des 2 heures, il reste encore beaucoup à faire.",Le marathon en moins de 2 heures est plus proche que jamais : un scientifique montre comment le Kenyan Kiptum teste les limites de l'homme,Null
"Le 16 septembre 2023 à Bamako, le Burkina Faso, le Mali et le Niger ont créé l'Alliance des États du Sahel (AES), un pacte de défense mutuelle. L'accord est signé dans le contexte d'une crise politique en cours au Niger, née à la suite d'un coup d'État le 26 juillet 2023 contre lequel la Communauté économique des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (Cedeao) menaçait d'intervenir militairement.
A cette occasion, les dirigeants des ces trois pays ont signé la Charte du Liptako-Gourma, nommée ainsi en référence à la région du Liptako-Gourma à cheval entre les trois pays et qui est au coeur des préoccupations sécuritaires du Sahel central. À travers l’AES, les pays membres s’engagent à établir une architecture de défense collective et d’assistance mutuelle et à lutter contre le terrorisme et la criminalité organisée.
L'AES est mise en place pour aider à contrer d'éventuelles menaces de rébellion armée ou d'agression extérieure, selon les États membres soulignant que :
toute attaque contre la souveraineté et l'intégrité territoriale d'une ou plusieurs parties contractantes sera considérée comme une agression contre les autres parties.
Le Sahel est confronté à une insurrection djihadiste depuis le début des années 2000. Cette situation est à l'origine de nombreux conflits dans la région, tels que la guerre du Mali et l'insurrection au Burkina Faso. Les trois États membres de l'AES ont connu des coups d’État militaires ces dernières années, provoquant une détérioration des relations avec le reste de la Cedeao et la communauté internationale.
De plus, ils ont la particularité d'être tous dirigés par des juntes militaires et d'avoir accueilli des troupes de l'ancienne puissance coloniale française sur leur sol.
La création de l’AES survient au moment où la Cedeao menace d'intervenir militairement au Niger pour favoriser le retour de l’ordre constitutionnel à la suite du coup d’État mené par le général Abdourahmane Tchiani. Cette initiative, qui semble être bien accueillie par l’opinion publique des pays membres, suscite cependant un certain nombre d’interrogations.
Nos recherches portent sur les questions de sécurité au Sahel. Dans cet article, nous essayons d'analyser les raisons de la création de cette alliance, ses implications probables sur la coopération régionale ainsi que ses chances de succès.
Une volonté de solidarité régionale
Pendant plus d’une décennie, la lutte contre l’insécurité au Sahel était menée par la France qui a joué le rôle de “nation-cadre”, notamment dans la coordination entre les acteurs locaux et internationaux. Cela a changé après le retrait de Barkhane du Mali en 2022 et de l’opération Sabre du Burkina Faso en 2023.
L’AES traduit une volonté et un effort de solidarité régionale qui tentent de rompre avec la manière dont le terrorisme et le crime organisé ont été combattus. Par exemple, l’inefficacité perçue de la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel (FCG5) et de l’opération française Barkhane a contribué au fait que le Mali ait décidé de chercher d’autres partenaires comme la Russie.
La recrudescence de l’insécurité au Sahel montre, cependant, qu’en matière de lutte contre le terrorisme et le crime organisé, la volonté et la solidarité ne suffisent pas. Le Liptako-Gourma, une région vaste de 370 000 km2 abritant 45 % de la population totale des trois États, vit une grave crise sécuritaire du fait de la présence de groupes armés qui profitent du retrait de l’opération française Barkhane.
En février 2023, le nombre de décès liés à la violence politique avait augmenté de 77 % au Burkina Faso et de 150 % au Mali par rapport à 2021. Le Burkina Faso est désormais le pays qui compte le plus grand nombre de victimes d’actes de terrorisme au monde, devant l’Afghanistan.
Contraintes à la coopération
La création de l’AES pour renforcer la solidarité dans la lutte contre l’insécurité intervient à un moment où la coopération régionale et internationale au Sahel manque de fluidité. La FCG5, qui avait suscité beaucoup d’espoirs au moment de son lancement en 2017, négocie sa survie depuis le retrait du Mali en 2022. La coopération avec les partenaires européens a été freinée par une succession d’évènements et de décisions dont la dénonciation par le Mali, le Burkina Faso et le Niger de plusieurs accords de défense avec Paris et le retrait des troupes françaises.
Si certains partenaires tels que les États-Unis maintiennent une présence au Sahel, ces nombreux changements constituent autant de contraintes à la dynamique de coopération en construction dans la région depuis presque vingt ans.
La Cedeao n’a pas encore engagé de ressources dans la lutte contre le terrorisme au Sahel. En revanche, l’organisation a été très active dans les processus de résolution des crises politiques liées aux coups d’État en Afrique de l’Ouest, sans pour autant avoir réussi à inciter des transitions vers le pouvoir civil.
En revanche, les menaces de la Cedeao d’intervenir militairement au Niger ont joué un rôle dans la création de l’AES dont les membres se sont engagés à se porter assistance mutuellement en cas d’agression.
Quelle sera la relation entre l’AES et la Cedeao ? Il est encore trop tôt pour le dire. Il en est de même des relations entre l’AES et d’autres initiatives comme la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel et l’Initiative d’Accra. Pour le moment, les pays de l’AES sont dans une logique d’opposition à la Cedeao.
Déficit de moyens aériens
L’AES semble être le prolongement d’un effort d’autonomisation de la lutte contre le terrorisme de la part des trois pays. La recrudescence de l’insécurité au Sahel montre, cependant, qu’en matière de lutte contre le terrorisme et le crime organisé, la volonté d’être autonome ne suffit pas.
Les pays de l’AES s’engagent à financer l’initiative par leurs propres contributions. En raison de leurs capacités limitées, il y a toutefois peu de chance qu’ils parviennent à assurer par eux-mêmes l’effort de guerre contre le terrorisme qui nécessite beaucoup de ressources financières.
Les forces armées du Mali, du Niger et du Burkina Faso présentent aussi de grandes faiblesses capacitaires, au premier rang desquels un déficit de moyens aériens. Les états-majors des armées avec qui nous avons échangé lors de nos entretiens au Sahel demeurent convaincus que leurs forces de défense et de sécurité pourraient combattre efficacement le terrorisme si elles disposaient de capacités aériennes significatives.
À travers l’AES, les pays membres misent sur l’approche militaire. Il faut toutefois noter que la performance dans la lutte contre les menaces sécuritaires ne dépend pas uniquement des moyens militaires. L’expérience au Sahel a montré que cette approche purement sécuritaire a tendance à favoriser l’escalade et les violences contre les civils. Certes, à travers l'Alliance Sahel, l'Union européenne et d'autre partenaires ont, parallèlement à l'intervention militaire, financé des projet de développement, mais sans impact majeur.
En tant que système de défense et d’assistance mutuelle, la Charte du Liptako-Gourma n’aborde pas le développement économique et social qui est pourtant indispensable dans la lutte contre l’insécurité. L’AES reste pour le moment un signal géopolitique rattaché à une structure sécuritaire encore embryonnaire.","Burkina Faso, Mali et Niger signent un pacte de défense : l’Alliance des États du Sahel en quête d’autonomie stratégique",Null
"La pêche artisanale est un secteur refuge ou de reconversion pour de nombreux agriculteurs et éleveurs victimes du changement climatique dans le Sahel. Mais au cours des quatre dernières décennies, la tendance à la surexploitation a causé la diminution de 20 à 50 % des quantités de poissons présents dans les eaux sénégalaises, et par conséquent la qualité de vie des pêcheurs. Cette diminution a surtout concerné les poissons de fonds dits “démersaux”, alors que l'abondance des petits poissons pélagiques (comme les sardinelles) fluctuait principalement sous l’effet des conditions climatiques. Mais depuis 2021, les captures de sardinelles rondes dans la sous-région ont chuté en-deça du dixième de ce qu'elles étaient à leur apogée, en 2011. Ce qui pourrait indiquer un effondrement prochain de cette pêcherie (en science halieutique l'effondrement sera acté si cette situation s'étale sur 4 années consécutives).
La sardinelle ronde est historiquement une des principales espèces capturées et transformées artisanalement en Afrique du Nord et de l'Ouest. Elle contribue à la fois en quantité et en qualité à l’alimentation des populations sahéliennes. Elle est source d'omega 3, une molécule nécessaire au maintien des fonctions vitales et en particulier pour le développement du cerveau.
Les qualités de la sardinelle ronde en font également une espèce de choix pour la fabrication des farines de poissons dont la demande ne cesse de grimper sur le marché mondial. Mais depuis quelques années, les consommateurs sénégalais et mauritaniens ont constaté la raréfaction des sardinelles rondes, souvent absentes des étalages.
Au Sénégal, les quantités annuelles débarquées fluctuaient de 100 000 à 250 000 tonnes dans les années 2010, mais stagnent autour de 10 000 tonnes depuis 2020. Nous cherchons ici à interpréter ces changements à la lumière de nos récentes recherches sur les migrations de cette espèce dans la sous région.
Disparition progressive des sardinelles rondes
A l’ouverture du symposium international sur les petits pélagiques dans la zone nord-ouest africaine tenu à Nouakchott en mai 2022, un industriel fustigeait les “extrémistes écolo” qui proposeraient des quotas de pêche trop bas.
Lors de ce même symposium, nous avons appris pourtant la chute vertigineuse des captures de sardinelles rondes à l’échelle de la sous-région, passant de 425 561 tonnes en 2018 à 49 550 tonnes en 2021.
Les récents développements de la recherche océanographique ont permis d’étudier la migration des sardinelles sous l’angle de la modélisation biophysique, c’est-à-dire de modéliser leurs déplacements directement à partir de la dynamique des courants, du plancton et des poissons eux-mêmes, indépendamment des données de pêche. Les résultats suggèrent l'existence d’une grande diversité de routes migratoires mais seule une faible proportion de poissons effectue la migration complète historiquement décrite et classiquement admise.
La vision proposée par le modèle, corroborée par les données obtenues auprès des artisans pêcheurs sénégalais, est celle d’une grande proportion de sardinelles rondes basées en Mauritanie qui déborderait au gré des courants et des saisons vers le nord ou vers le sud. Aussi, le modèle suggère une extension au large des sardinelles variable selon les saisons, mais une densité toujours plus forte dans la zone côtière.
En résumé, cette étude a montré que le cœur de la population des sardinelles rondes, la zone la plus dense, centre de gravité des migrations saisonnières qui alimente les pays voisins, se situerait dans la frange côtière des eaux mauritaniennes. Ce qui explique les captures exceptionnelles qui y sont réalisées depuis l’avènement des usines de farine de poissons en Mauritanie.
Développement des usines de farine de poisson
Depuis 2012, l'industrie de farine de poisson dans la sous-région a connu un développement rapide, surtout en Mauritanie (environ 40 usines sur 650 km de côte) relativement au Sénégal et en Gambie (environ 10 usines sur 550 km de côte). En Mauritanie, ce développement a eu un effet particulièrement notoire sur la distribution et l’intensité de l’effort de pêche. Avant, la Mauritanie passait des accords avec des bateaux-usines étrangers, les autorisant à exploiter ses eaux hauturières, c'est à dire au-delà de 7 miles nautiques (environ 14 km) des côtes. Lorsque la densité de poissons chutait, les bateaux étrangers se redéployaient vers d’autres régions du monde.
Pour des raisons de valorisation et de domestication des ressources halieutiques et de développement économique local, les politiques nationales entre 2013 et 2016 ont encouragé l’installation des usines à terre.
Malheureusement, ce changement de paradigme a amplifié le problème de surexploitation des sardinelles rondes. En effet, les usines sont devenues de nouveaux acheteurs capables chacune d’engloutir quotidiennement des quantités considérables de poissons. Pour les alimenter en poissons frais, des accords ont été passés successivement avec le Sénégal puis la Turquie sous l’appellation “affrètement coque nue”.
Dans les deux cas, ces flottes sont autorisées à pêcher dans la zone côtière, où les sardinelles rondes et autres espèces se concentrent, comme expliqué plus haut.
Le mécanisme de régulation de l'effort de pêche qui pouvait se mettre en œuvre avec la pêche hauturière étrangère en cas de baisse des captures devient difficile pour le cas des bateaux côtiers travaillant dans le cadre d'un affrètement. En effet, ceux-ci opèrent pour le compte d'usines de farine localisées le long des côtes et qui demandent un ravitaillement permanent, ce qui est possible en Mauritanie en puisant dans la riche zone côtière.

Surexploitation de la sardinelle
Pour mieux comprendre ce qui se joue dans cette sous-région, imaginons une métaphore simple. Pensez à une grande baignoire remplie d'eau, dans laquelle se trouvent deux tuyaux, l’un qui arrive près du fond et l’autre à mi-hauteur. L'eau de la baignoire représente l’ensemble des sardinelles rondes de la sous-région. La pêche qui s’exerce dans la zone côtière mauritanienne équivaut à pomper l’eau de la baignoire par le tuyau qui arrive près du fond.
En revanche, la pêche qui s’exerce dans les autres zones, donc au large de la Mauritanie ou bien dans les zones adjacentes nord et sud, reviendrait à pomper l’eau par le tuyau à mi-hauteur. Si l’on pompe à la fois dans les deux tuyaux, le tuyau à mi-hauteur sera asséché avant celui du fond. Et donc avant que les captures ne diminuent dans la zone côtière mauritanienne, elles tomberont très bas dans les autres zones.
Cela est dû au fait que dans le modèle, les sardinelles se déplacent sans cesse, mais se trouvent en moyenne plus souvent dans la zone côtière de la Mauritanie. Cette métaphore illustre un phénomène appelé “hyperstabilité des captures”, souvent observé dans les pêcheries à travers le monde.
Ainsi, il apparaît évident que l’établissement des usines de farines de poissons a créé une situation qui menace la population de sardinelles rondes en créant une demande sans limite alimentée par une exploitation intense dans la zone côtière mauritanienne.
La prise en compte des résultats scientifiques dans les mesures de gestion est un processus très long. Dès 2014, les scientifiques avaient tiré la sonnette d’alarme sur le risque de surexploitation des espèces migratrices induit par ces nouvelles pratiques.
Depuis 2014, différents travaux halieutiques, bioéconomiques et socio-économiques publiés par des scientifiques mauritaniens et sénégalais ont également tiré la sonnette d’alarme. Mais les mesures prises, avec une faible coordination des gouvernements des pays concernés, se sont révélées inadaptées ou insuffisantes pour empêcher l’effondrement annoncé par les scientifiques de la population de sardinelle ronde.
Que faire ?
Une régulation concertée et informée de la pêche au niveau des Etats est plus que jamais nécessaire. Si les sardinelles rondes se retrouvent le plus souvent en Mauritanie, elles traversent les frontières maritimes, du Maroc à la Guinée.
Les récentes constatations sur la diminution de la sardinelle ronde au Sénégal nous poussent à croire que cette espèce devrait figurer à minima dans l’annexe 2 de la convention sur la conservation des espèces migratrices appartenant à la faune sauvage (CMS), c'est-à-dire la liste des espèces devant faire l’objet d’accords entre les pays traversés.
Face à cette responsabilité partagée, il faut une gestion collective reposant par exemple sur un système de suivi de l’effort de pêche harmonisé au niveau sous-régional. Autrement dit, il faut renforcer la mission de coopération de la commission sous-régionale des pêches (CSRP), organisation intergouvernementale qui pourrait par exemple appuyer à l'attribution d'écocertification - processus par lequel un organisme évalue et atteste qu'un produit, un service et une entreprise respecte des normes environnementales spécifiques - aux pêcheries qui, par leur réglementation, favorisent la gestion commune, et donc leur durabilité. Bien sûr, un accord explicite des dits gouvernements est nécessaire, bien que déjà acquis sur le principe par les signataires de la CMS.
Enfin, il faut respecter les habitats essentiels des sardinelles rondes comme leurs zones de reproduction et de nurseries. Le Banc du Sahara, le Banc d'Arguin et la Petite Côte sont par exemple trois sites clefs identifiés. Il convient de mieux les étudier pour comprendre leurs vulnérabilités. La zone côtière mauritanienne devrait faire l’objet d’une attention particulière en raison de son rôle important pour les capacités de renouvellement de cette espèce migratoire.",Raréfaction des sardinelles rondes en Afrique du Nord-Ouest : comment éviter l'effondrement,Null
"En Afrique de l'Ouest, il est courant de voir le bétail paître librement, même dans les grandes villes, sur les autoroutes et dans les aéroports.
Chaque année, environ 300 millions de têtes de bétail (principalement des bovins) traversent l'Afrique de l'Ouest. Selon les saisons, ils quittent leurs zones de pâturage habituelles à la recherche d'eau et de nourriture.
Ces pratiques, appelées pastoralisme ou transhumance, remontent à des millénaires. Elles ont permis de maximiser l'utilisation des terres dans les régions sèches.
Afin de soutenir ces pratiques, la Communauté économique des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (Cedeao) a élaboré des règlements en 1998 et 2003. Tous les États membres de la Cedeao devaient appliquer ces règlements.
En tant qu’expert en droit alimentaire et agricole, en développement des ressources naturelles et en commerce international, j'ai examiné les règlements pour voir quels effets ils pouvaient avoir sur les investissements dans le secteur de l'élevage.
Mes conclusions montrent que la productivité du bétail ne s'est pas améliorée dans la région depuis l'introduction des nouvelles règles. La productivité du bétail a chuté et la production de lait s'est très peu améliorée. Les affrontements entre agriculteurs et éleveurs ont augmenté, de même que l'insécurité. Les élites profitent de la réglementation pour exploiter les pauvres éleveurs.
J'en conclus que les réglementations peuvent décourager des investissements significatifs à grande échelle tels que l'élevage en ranch qui pourraient augmenter la productivité, créer des emplois et assurer la paix dans la région.
Mouvements de bétail en Afrique de l'Ouest
La Cedeao est la seule communauté économique régionale d'Afrique à disposer de réglementations spécifiques régissant la transhumance. L'organisation régionale est composée de 15 Etats.
Ses réglementations visent à améliorer la productivité du bétail et la sécurité alimentaire, à améliorer l'environnement et à réduire la pauvreté.
Les règlements autorisent la libre circulation du bétail à travers les frontières des États membres sous certaines conditions. Par exemple, les éleveurs doivent posséder le certificat international de transhumance de la Cedeao et un minimum de deux éleveurs doit accompagner les troupeaux. Les éleveurs doivent être âgés d'au moins 18 ans.
Les États membres sont tenus d'appliquer les règlements. Mais ils ne le font pas de manière uniforme. Certains États côtiers n'autorisent pas les éleveurs à entrer sur leur territoire. Par exemple, la République du Bénin a récemment interdit l'entrée d'éleveurs étrangers sur son territoire. Le Togo et la Côte d'Ivoire contrôlent le nombre d'éleveurs qui entrent sur leur territoire chaque année.
Pour sa part, le Nigeria s'oriente vers un élevage sédentaire. Plusieurs États du Nigeria, tels que Benue et Oyo, ont également interdit le pastoralisme.
Ces pays ont restreint le mouvement des troupeaux en raison d'expériences négatives telles que les affrontements entre agriculteurs et éleveurs, le vol de bétail et d'autres formes de criminalité.
Impact des réglementations de la Cedeao en matière de transhumance
Dans mon article, je soutiens que la réglementation de la Cedeao permet à la transhumance d'exister sous une forme qui n'est pas favorable à d'autres options d'investissement commercial - comme l'élevage - pour la production de bétail dans la région.
Les investisseurs veulent des bénéfices, des environnements sûrs et des règles sûres. Le pastoralisme, quant à lui, encourage la main-d'œuvre bon marché et d'autres pratiques qui mettent en péril les investissements à grande échelle dans le secteur de l'élevage.
Mauvais environnement commercial
La transhumance a été commercialisée - et criminalisée - de manière à créer un environnement négatif pour le secteur de l'élevage.
Les mouvements de troupeaux ont contribué aux conflits entre agriculteurs et éleveurs, à la violence sexiste, à l'insécurité et aux autres formes de criminalité.
Les trafiquants, les contrebandiers, les bandits et les trafiquants de drogue profitent des mouvements de bétail pour commettre des crimes.
La prolifération des armes, le terrorisme, les enlèvements et la consommation de drogue ont également augmenté sous le couvert de la transhumance.
Au Nigeria, par exemple, les insurgés de Boko Haram sont accusés de se déguiser en éleveurs pour transporter des engins explosifs improvisés afin d'attaquer les communautés.
Découragement de l'investissement
Je soutiens également que les règlements de la Cedeao, en permettant aux troupeaux de se déplacer dans la région, découragent l'investissement dans les méthodes modernes de production de bétail. En effet, le coût de production de la transhumance est faible. La terre et le fourrage sont gratuits. La main-d'œuvre est bon marché et exploitée. Tout cela rend les autres modèles d'entreprise, tels que l'élevage, relativement peu attrayants. Cela impacte leurs profits et les risques d'investissement.
Certains pays qui pratiquent le pastoralisme, comme la Mongolie et le Tibet, le limitent aux régions arides.
Ce qu'il faut faire
Selon moi, la pratique de la transhumance en Afrique de l'Ouest devrait être progressivement abandonnée. J'entends par là une interdiction progressive - et finalement totale - des mouvements transfrontaliers des éleveurs.
En effet, la transhumance n'est pas une utilisation efficace des terres. Environ un tiers de la superficie de l'Afrique de l'Ouest est utilisée pour l'agriculture. Les deux tiers de ces terres servent de parcours et de pâturages, tandis qu'un tiers est utilisé pour la production de cultures. Des zones de pâturage désignées devraient être établies dans les parties semi-arides de la région. Le pastoralisme devrait être limité à ces terres.
À mon avis, les conflits seront réduits si la transhumance est limitée aux régions arides et semi-arides. Cela rendra l'élevage plus attrayant et permettra des investissements à grande échelle susceptibles de créer des emplois et d'améliorer la sécurité alimentaire.
Dans l'avenir immédiat, l'accent devrait être mis sur :
l'application stricte du Certificat international de transhumance. Le certificat contient généralement des informations sur la composition du troupeau, les vaccins administrés, l'itinéraire des troupeaux et la destination de l'éleveur. La responsabilité de la délivrance du certificat incombe au pays d'origine. Cela devrait permettre de réduire le nombre d'éléments criminels déguisés en éleveurs.
la limitation du nombre de têtes de bétail que l'on peut avoir dans un troupeau en mouvement. Cela permettra d'éviter que les troupeaux ne s'égarent et les conflits qui en résultent.
l'introduction de nouvelles règles exigeant l'utilisation de marques auriculaires. Cette mesure faciliterait la traçabilité en cas de vol de bétail ou de destruction de terres agricoles.",Les règles de la Cedeao visant à protéger les éleveurs découragent les investissements dans l'élevage moderne,Null
"Quand la star du football tanzanien Mbwana Ally Samatta a signé avec Aston Villa en 2020, il s'agissait de bien plus qu'un simple transfert d'un joueur africain vers le sommet du football mondial. Il est le premier Tanzanien à jouer en Premier League anglaise et son transfert a suscité enthousiasme et fierté dans le milieu du football d'Afrique de l'Est.
Tout le monde espérait que Samatta mettrait la Tanzanie - un pays notoirement peu performant - dans le football international - sur la carte mondiale du jeu. Contrairement à l'Afrique de l'Ouest et à l'Afrique du Nord, la région n'a pas produit beaucoup de joueurs qui évoluent régulièrement au haut niveau en Europe.
Nous avons voulu savoir pourquoi. Nos recherches ont mis en évidence un certain nombre de facteurs structurels, historiques et culturels en jeu, tant à l'intérieur qu'à l'extérieur du sport. Il s'agit notamment de l'héritage colonial et de l'absence d'une politique de football pour les jeunes qui fonctionne et soit dynamique. Un autre facteur est que “réussir” à l'étranger semble moins important pour les joueurs d'Afrique de l'Est que pour leurs homologues de l'ouest et du nord du continent.
Des dirigeants incompétents
Le football est mal géré en Afrique de l'Est. La mauvaise gestion financière, le  leadership faible et la corruption ont fait des ravages. Il n'y a pas assez d'argent pour payer le personnel clé ou pour financer les infrastructures, ce qui entrave les efforts de développement.
Lors d'un entretien réalisé dans le cadre de cette étude, Kim Poulsen, l'entraîneur principal de l'équipe nationale masculine de Tanzanie, a déclaré que, dans le domaine du football, la corruption et l'incompétence des dirigeants ont eu raison des efforts de développement,
des dirigeants corrompus et incompétents ont miné l'Afrique de l'Est à tous les niveaux.
En conséquence, la Tanzanie ne dispose pas d'une politique de football des jeunes qui fonctionne et qui permette de former de futurs joueurs de haut niveau. Il existe quelques académies privées performantes, mais il n'y a pas de stratégie plus large pour le football des jeunes. Cela n'est pas dû à un manque de talent : Poulsen a déclaré qu'il y avait beaucoup de joueurs doués “mais qu'il n'y avait pas de structure et qu'on ne les découvrait donc jamais”.
Les succès internationaux comme ceux de Samatta ou des stars kenyanes McDonald Mariga et Victor Wanyama sont donc des exceptions. Il y a très certainement d'autres stars est-africaines qui attendent dans les coulisses, mais elles sont perdues parce qu'il n'y a pas de programme national de développement des talents minutieux, rigoureux et à long terme pour les soutenir.

En revanche, les pays d'Afrique de l'Ouest tels que le Ghana et le Nigeria bénéficient depuis longtemps de championnats de jeunes à l'échelle nationale qui ont ouvert la voie à des succès lors des coupes du monde de la FIFA pour les jeunes. De nombreux joueurs ont servi d'ossature aux équipes nationales masculines du Ghana et du Nigeria qui ont connu le succès par la suite.
Réseaux et héritages coloniaux
Les anciens liens coloniaux restent forts dans certains pays de football. Par exemple, les joueurs des anciennes colonies françaises d'Afrique de l'Ouest et du Nord sont surreprésentés en France. Les clubs belges alignent souvent des joueurs originaires de l'ancienne colonie du pays, la République démocratique du Congo. Il en va de même pour les anciennes colonies portugaises d'Angola et du Mozambique.
C'est tout à fait le contraire pour les anciennes colonies britanniques. La faiblesse des liens footballistiques entre les pays africains et la Grande-Bretagne remonte aux années 1930, lorsque le Royaume-Uni a mis en place des politiques protectionnistes pour soutenir son économie. Entre autres mesures, les règles d'immigration ont été renforcées et appliquées au football professionnel. Selon l'historien Matthew Taylor, la Grande-Bretagne est restée pendant plusieurs décennies “une zone interdite aux footballeurs étrangers”. Le football britannique ne se tournait pas vers ses colonies pour recruter des joueurs comme le font la France, la Belgique ou le Portugal.
Vers la fin des années 1900, la commercialisation du football de club et l'assouplissement des restrictions imposées aux joueurs étrangers dans le football européen, ainsi que le succès des équipes nationales africaines dans les compétitions internationales de jeunes ont stimulé la migration des footballeurs africains vers l'Europe.
Des joueurs de tout le continent, y compris d'anciennes colonies britanniques comme le Ghana et le Nigeria, sont devenus des cibles pour les clubs de toute l'Europe. Mais les footballeurs d'Afrique de l'Est sont restés à l'écart. Cela s'explique en partie par le fait que les équipes nationales du Kenya, de l'Ouganda et de la Tanzanie sont toujours peu performantes. Ce qui signifie que leurs joueurs ne sont pas très visibles au niveau international et qu'ils doivent faire face à des restrictions pour participer à des compétitions de haut niveau telles que la Premier League anglaise.
Une autre raison peut être trouvée au-delà du sport. Elle est liée aux tendances générales et aux approches culturelles de la migration internationale en Afrique de l'Est.
Attitudes à l'égard de la migration
Contrairement à de nombreux autres contextes africains et surtout occidentaux, la mobilité sociale en Afrique de l'Est n'est pas inévitablement associée à une migration réussie à l'étranger.
Bien que les jeunes d'Afrique de l'Est aient généralement une très bonne opinion de l'Europe en tant que lieu d'opportunités, cette image n'a rien déclenché qui ressemble à la culture migratoire massive dans de grandes parties de l’Afrique de l'Ouest. L'idée de migrer vers l'Europe est rarement mise en pratique. Au contraire, les migrations internationales en provenance d'Afrique de l'Est ont principalement lieu dans la région, en Afrique australe ou dans la région du Golfe.
En l'absence de réseaux de mobilité vers l'Europe, les footballeurs d'Afrique de l'Est préfèrent vivre de leur sport dans leur région. Un joueur professionnel dans un club kenyan, ougandais ou tanzanien de premier plan peut s'assurer un revenu relativement stable et satisfaisant. Cette approche ne comporte pas les risques, incertitudes et précarité que l'on peut rencontrer en essayant de construire une carrière de footballeur à l'étranger.
Mais cette tendance à rester près de chez soi signifie que les jeunes footballeurs d'Afrique de l'Est manquent de modèles sur la scène internationale. Poulsen s'est ainsi interrogé: “Pensez à un pauvre garçon en Tanzanie : qui devrait-il admirer ? Pour savoir s'il doit poursuivre le football ? Samatta, par exemple, a quitté Aston Villa après une demi-saison difficile et n'a pas connu de succès notable depuis.
Les jeunes joueurs d'Afrique de l'Ouest et du Nord, quant à eux, peuvent s'inspirer de nombreux joueurs locaux.

Obstacles
D'après notre analyse, il semble que la situation ne s'améliorera pas de sitôt pour le football d'Afrique de l'Est. Bien que Samatta soit de retour dans le club où il a fait ses débuts dans le football international, le KRC Genk, ancien champion de Belgique, il a entamé les dernières années de sa carrière active. Aucun modèle ne semble en mesure de lui succéder et de faire tomber les barrières qui empêchent la région d'aligner davantage de talents sur la scène internationale. Nous serions heureux d'apprendre que ce n'est pas le cas. L'Afrique de l'Est doit mettre en place des structures efficaces et durables dans le domaine du football. Alors, un jour, une équipe nationale de la région pourra peut-être être reconnue sur la scène internationale.",Les footballeurs d'Afrique de l'Est sont rares sur la scène internationale : nous avons cherché les raisons,Null
"Une vague de migrants sénégalais débarquent depuis quelques temps sur les côtes espagnoles et italiennes ou franchissent les frontières des États-Unis. Directeur du laboratoire d’études et de recherches sur le genre, l’environnement, la religion et les migrations de l'Université Gaston Berger de Saint-Louis et président de l’Observatoire sénégalais des migrations, Aly Tandian explique à Assane Diagne de The Conversation Afrique les raisons de ces migrations irrégulières et les changements à opérer pour éviter ces risques.
A combien estimez-vous le nombre de Sénégalais à avoir migré ?
Il est difficile de répondre à cette question pour plusieurs raisons. Avec les nombreuses raisons avancées par les candidats à la migration et par leurs parents qui jouent un rôle important sur les départs, le voyage semble être le raccourci pour se réaliser, surtout dans un contexte où les gens migrent par et pour devoir, honneur et fierté.
De plus, la migration est à la fois comme une charge émotionnelle, une charge morale et une charge mentale. On migre pour le bien-être personnel, face aux pressions familiales et suite aux injonctions sociales. Pour toutes ces raisons, je ne pense pas que la forte envie de migrer va s’estomper de sitôt tant que les causes profondes demeurent.
Quels sont les principaux moteurs de cette migration, les facteurs d'attraction et de répulsion ?
Nous devons marquer une rupture et éviter les réponses mécaniques que nous avons l'habitude de proposer pour justifier les principaux moteurs de la migration surtout celle dite irrégulière.
Nos récentes recherches effectuées dans plusieurs pays d’Afrique de l’Ouest nous indiquent que les populations, surtout, certains jeunes migrent ou ont envie de migrer à cause de la pénibilité du travail et du faible salaire, de l’angoisse, du sentiment d’abandon ou de la frustration. D’autres soutiennent qu’à l’étranger il est possible de gagner assez et d’épargner. Ils migrent parce que les bénéfices engrangés au Sénégal n’appartiennent pas aux travailleurs mais plutôt à leurs employeurs. A côté de cela, il y a des jeunes qui disent qu’ils veulent migrer pour acquérir plus de prestige au sein de leur famille ou de leur communauté, migrer parce que la pêche n’est plus rentable à cause de la présence de chalutiers étrangers, migrer parce que le diplôme ne garantit plus l’emploi, migrer pour monnayer leurs talents et compétences artistiques et sportives.
Quels sont les groupes d'âge les plus susceptibles de migrer et pourquoi ces groupes ?
Il faut souligner qu’il n’y a pas d’âge pour migrer. L’affaire Doudou à Mbour, un enfant mis sur une pirogue pour rejoindre l’Europe, en est un indicateur, sans compter d’autres cas constatés plus récemment. Il y a une réelle précocité d’âge des migrants et candidats à la migration. Il faut se demander si ce sont des jeunes qui décident de migrer, ou bien, s'ils partent sous la pression des familles. En outre, sur les routes migratoires, il y a des personnes âgées ayant connu plusieurs années d’expériences professionnelles. Ce sont des personnes qui tentent l'aventure en espérant gagner de l'argent.
Pour poursuivre sur les groupes démographiques, il faut prendre en compte la structure des ménages dont sont issus les candidats aux migrations irrégulières. La polygamie qui caractérise assez souvent ces ménages semble favoriser la compétition entre enfants de mères différentes d'une part et entre épouses du même conjoint d'autre part. Des acteurs originaires de ménages polygamiques sont fort présents sur les routes migratoires.
En plus de la structure des ménages, il faut prendre en compte la position des candidats à la migration irrégulière au sein de leur fratrie. De nombreux candidats à la migration irrégulière sont des aînés et ils sont appelés à prendre la relève de leurs parents en âge de la retraite lorsqu’ils vivent encore. Pour comprendre cela, je note que dans nos sociétés africaines, être aîné est un impératif de venir en aide à la famille et de sauver l’honneur.
Sous le poids des besoins et face au regard des autres, il revient à l'aîné de sauver l'honneur de la famille. Le chanteur sénégalais Youssou Ndour en a fait référence à travers ses chansons. L’aîné jouit d’une position privilégiée au sein de sa fratrie, par conséquent, le rang de naissance aux allures de responsabilités façonne la personnalité. Ainsi être l’aîné est comme une charge mentale insoupçonnée.
En plus de ces considérations sociales, il y a lieu de rappeler qu’avec la baisse des ressources halieutiques au Sénégal, des pêcheurs se sont transformés en passeurs ou en ouvriers dans les chalutiers étrangers. Le changement climatique a provoqué des milliers de migrants irréguliers supplémentaires à la perte d'emplois dans le secteur touristique avec la fermeture d'hôtels.
Pire au niveau des côtes sénégalaises, on note une présence massive de chalutiers étrangers qui pillent les ressources. Comment demander à des milliers de personnes de rester chez elles sans aucun effort d’arrêter des chalutiers étrangers qui pillent les côtes sénégalaises ? Comment arrêter les migrations irrégulières au moment où des populations sont appauvries injustement par une mondialisation énorme et peu élégante ?

La migration peut être très risquée. Quels sont les changements à opérer au Sénégal pour éviter ces risques ?
Le Sénégal a élaboré un document appelé Politique nationale de migration validé techniquement en 2018 par des parties prenantes concernées directement ou indirectement sous l’égide du ministère de l’Économie, des Finances et du Plan. C’est un document à revoir car une politique migratoire ne devrait pas se limiter à une compilation de lois et d’arrêtés.
En termes d’initiatives, il y a la loi du 25 janvier 1971 relative aux conditions d’admission, de séjour et d’établissement des étrangers au Sénégal et la loi du 10 mai 2005 relative à la lutte contre la traite des personnes, pratiques assimilées ainsi que la protection des victimes. Seulement, leurs effets sont peu ou pas du tout manifestes. Plus récemment, un Comité interministériel de lutte contre l’émigration clandestine a été créé sur la base du décret du 30 décembre 2020.
Ce sont des initiatives avec des procédés de sécurisation alors que la migration a besoin d’une réponse holistique qui ne devrait pas se limiter aux services du ministère de l’Intérieur et du ministère des Affaires étrangères et des Sénégalais de l’Extérieur. Les agendas de nos États devraient aller au-delà de la gestion qui souvent propose des campagnes de sensibilisation peu adaptées et aux contenus désuets faites dans des zones de départ et non aux zones d’origine. C'est au niveau des zones d'origine que des réponses doivent être proposées car ce sont les véritables lieux où sont mobilisées des ressources pour partir. Les départs récents nous renseignent que les candidats sont originaires de Linguère, de Diourbel, etc. loin des côtes maritimes.
L’impératif est d’arriver à une politique de migration circulaire avec un cadre précis et transparent, profitable à tous et qui prend en compte le discours des concernés, les migrants, les candidats à la migration ainsi que leurs parents, les acteurs de la société civile et les politiques. La gestion sécuritaire a amplement montré ses limites. Il nous faut une véritable gouvernance des migrations profitable à tous.
Il nous faut un processus qui promeut la coordination entre différentes autorités et cadres juridiques de régulation migratoire afin d’apporter une réponse conjointe et coordonnée au phénomène et d’encourager la coopération internationale en la matière. Pour cela, il nous faut des institutions qui peuvent aider à élaborer des politiques migratoires.
Nos États ont besoin de données unifiées et centralisées pour une meilleure connaissance des causes matérielles et immatérielles de la migration. C’est en ce sens qu’ils vont arriver à élaborer des politiques d’offre d’emplois basées sur des évidences empiriques.
Comment agir sur les facteurs structurels (économiques, climatiques, familiaux)? Y a-t-il des leviers à la disposition des autorités pour peser et modifier les comportements ?
La question des migrations irrégulières ne peut pas continuer à être traitée comme un sujet de pudeur et la réponse ne peut pas être sécuritaire. Il faut en parler avec raison et responsabilité en situant leurs véritables causes économiques, environnementales et sociétales. Il y a des préalables à résoudre rapidement, en premier lieu, le cas de la pêche avec les chalutiers étrangers qui ont destructuré le secteur transformant des centaines de pêcheurs en simples facilitateurs de voyages irréguliers. Des formations de qualité qui répondent aux marchés locaux ainsi qu’une politique d'autoemploi avec un accompagnement institutionnel et financier devraient faire perdre l’envie de partir de manière irrégulière à de nombreux jeunes sénégalais. Cela pourrait réussir plus facilement avec une profonde déconstruction sur certaines idées reçues qui font penser une vie meilleure sans effort en Europe.",Sénégal : pourquoi la concertation est nécessaire pour une politique migratoire efficace,Null
"Après environ deux mois de querelles entre la France et le nouveau régime militaire au Niger, le président Emmanuel Macron a finalement décidé, le 24 septembre, de rappeler l'ambassadeur de France et de retirer les forces militaires françaises du Niger.
Il s'agit d'un revirement. Quatre semaines auparavant, Macron avait refusé de suivre les instructions des putschistes qui avaient ordonné à l'ambassadeur et aux forces françaises de quitter le pays. Il a fait valoir qu'il ne reconnaissait pas la nouvelle junte, qui a pris le pouvoir le 26 juillet, et a insisté sur le fait que ses forces resteraient dans le pays.
En tant que chercheur en politique et relations internationales, j'étudie la situation sécuritaire et la montée des insurrections au Sahel depuis plus d'une décennie. Selon moi, les actions de la France ont créé une incertitude inutile dans une région déjà en proie à l'insécurité en raison des activités djihadistes croissantes, ainsi que des six coups d'État réussis au cours des trois dernières années.
À mon avis, la France a commis une erreur stratégique. Bien qu'elle n'ait pas reconnu la junte, elle aurait dû maintenir la communication, surtout après s'être brouillée avec d'autres anciennes colonies comme le Mali et le Burkina Faso.
L'autre acteur extérieur important au Niger était les Etats-Unis. Ils ont décidé de négocier avec la junte. Contrairement à la France, ils n'ont pas qualifié la prise de pouvoir militaire de coup d'État. Les États-Unis ont repris les activités dans certaines de leurs bases au Niger, après avoir obtenu l'accord de la junte.
Les actions de M. Macron pourraient avoir trois conséquences négatives pour la région. Elles nuiront à la lutte contre le terrorisme. Elles ouvrent également la porte à une plus grande influence de Wagner, le groupe mercenaire soutenu par la Russie. Enfin, elles ont des répercussions sur la crise des migrants en Europe.
La lutte contre le terrorisme
Le Niger joue un rôle important dans la stratégie de sécurité du Sahel. Le pays est activement impliqué et contribue à des organisations de sécurité telles que le G5 Sahel et la Force multinationale mixte.
Ces organisations participent à la lutte contre le terrorisme dans la région. Outre sa contribution financière aux deux organisations, en particulier au G5 Sahel, la France participe également à la formation des forces nigériennes et au pilotage de drones de reconnaissance et d'attaque, luttant ainsi activement contre les terroristes dans la région.
La décision de la France de se retirer du Niger aura un impact sur les opérations de lutte contre le terrorisme dans la région. La France y est engagée depuis longtemps et dispose de soldats qui connaissent parfaitement la région. La perte de ces officiers créera un vide que le Niger pourrait avoir du mal à combler à court terme.
À l'instar de la France, les États-Unis ont également une présence militaire importante au Niger, où ils exploitent leur plus grande base de drones en Afrique. J'ai déjà analysé l'importance et les implications sécuritaires de la base de drones pour la région.
Pour sa part, l'Union européene contribue également à la sécurité de la région en fournissant des financements au G5 Sahel et à la Force multinationale mixte. Cette dynamique doit être maintenue afin de ne pas perdre ce qui a déjà jeté les bases d'un système de sécurité.
Le retrait des forces françaises aura un impact négatif sur le moral des soldats de l'alliance de sécurité et renforcera les groupes d'insurgés. Une augmentation des attaques terroristes a été enregistrée depuis le coup d'État.
Russie contre États-Unis
Les termes de l'accord entre les États-Unis et la junte militaire n'ont pas été publiés. Néanmoins, il n'est pas déraisonnable de supposer que l'une des raisons pour lesquelles Washington s'est assuré de rester au Niger était la crainte de perdre le pays au profit de la Russie.
Au Mali, la junte militaire a remplacé les troupes françaises par des forces Wagner. Depuis 2022, la Russie a gagné en influence par le biais du groupe Wagner après le départ de la France.
Washington voudrait éviter de perdre davantage de terrain au profit de l'influence russe. Le groupe Wagner étant déjà présent au Mali, on soupçonne que l'accord de défense entre les trois pays (Mali, Niger et Burkina Faso) pourrait étendre la présence du groupe.
En outre, les États-Unis ont investi massivement dans le Sahel, en particulier au Niger. Au cours de la dernière décennie, ils ont investi des centaines de millions de dollars dans des infrastructures de sécurité, y compris une base de drones à Agadez (centre du Niger).
Les États-Unis sont conscients du rôle que les “espaces non gouvernés” du Sahel pourraient jouer dans la propagation du terrorisme. Ce fut le cas des régions situées entre le Pakistan et l'Afghanistan, où Al-Qaida a lancé des attaques contre les États-Unis et leurs alliés occidentaux.
Ce que cela signifie pour la migration
D'autres acteurs importants au Niger, comme l'Union européenne, ne peuvent pas non plus se permettre de suivre la voie tracée par la France. L'UE a besoin de stabilité au Niger pour endiguer les trafics et éviter une nouvelle catastrophe humanitaire comme celle de 2015-16. L'Europe a connu le plus grand nombre de migrants transitant par le Niger et la Libye vers l'Europe au cours de cette période.
Il ne fait aucun doute que les régimes civils des présidents Mahamadou Issoufou et Mohamed Bazoum ont contribué à la réduction du flux de migrants transitant par le Niger vers la Libye. Alors qu'il était ministre de l'Intérieur, Bazoum a joué un rôle déterminant dans l'adoption d'une loi contre le trafic de migrants à travers le Niger. Cette loi a été défendue par Bazoum mais on pense également qu'elle a contribué à son éviction par les militaires. La junte pourrait menacer d'annuler l'accord et fermer les yeux sur le fait que les migrants passent à nouveau par le Niger pour entrer dans l'UE.
L'UE doit maintenir un canal diplomatique fort avec la junte afin de préserver la stabilité, d'empêcher une augmentation de la contrebande et de poursuivre les efforts en vue d'un retour à l'ordre démocratique.
Prochaines étapes
Bien que je comprenne qu'une diplomatie accrue avec la junte cimente son autorité, je pense que les puissances étrangères devraient accepter qu'il existe un gouvernement au Niger qui jouit d'un certain degré de popularité parmi les citoyens. Les canaux diplomatiques gelés doivent être réactivés pour éviter un effondrement total de l'architecture de sécurité du Sahel et pour parvenir à une transition rapide vers la démocratie.",Le retrait de la France du Niger est une mauvaise décision : voici trois raisons,Null
"Les procès nationaux pour génocide, crimes contre l'humanité et crimes de guerre sont considérés comme plus rapides, moins coûteux et plus adaptés aux besoins des victimes que les procès de la Cour pénale internationale à La Haye.
Mais donner la priorité aux juridictions nationales pour juger les crimes les plus graves présente à la fois des avantages et des inconvénients.
Dans un livre récemment publié, Les tribunaux pénaux internationaux et la justice nationale : Dans l’ombre de la Cour (en anglais : International Criminal Tribunals and Domestic Accountability. In the Court’s Shadow), j'analyse la relation complexe entre les initiatives internationales et nationales en matière de crimes les plus graves. Je me penche également sur la manière dont la transition des procès internationaux aux procès nationaux a eu un impact sur la lutte mondiale contre l'impunité.
Je m’appuie sur les expériences de trois pays africains : la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), le Rwanda et la Sierra Leone. Je montre que les systèmes judiciaires nationaux sont susceptibles d'être le principal forum pour les procès de crimes graves dans un avenir proche. Cependant, il y a une tendance croissante à romantiser ce qui peut être accompli au niveau national. Parallèlement, la capacité des tribunaux pénaux internationaux à servir la cause plus large des droits de l'homme est minimisée.
À l'avenir, j'espère susciter un débat plus nuancé sur la façon dont la justice internationale et la justice nationale devraient travailler ensemble.
La justice nationale
La justice pénale internationale est encore associée à des affaires internationales très médiatisées. L'une d'entre elles est le récent mandat d'arrêt contre le président russe Vladimir Poutine de la Cour pénale internationale.
Cependant, les tribunaux nationaux poursuivent aujourd'hui beaucoup plus de personnes pour crimes de guerre, crimes contre l'humanité et génocide. C'est le cas dans la plupart des pays. Que ce soit en RDC, en Ukraine ou en Colombie, la Cour pénale internationale joue un rôle de soutien à la justice nationale. Et elle n'a obtenu qu'une poignée de condamnations en 20 ans.
Read more: Putin and the ICC: history shows just how hard it is to bring a head of state to justice
C'est l'une des raisons pour lesquelles la justice nationale est aujourd'hui considérée comme plus rapide, moins coûteuse et plus respectueuse des victimes. Deux décennies seulement après la création de la Cour pénale internationale, de nombreuses parties prenantes affirment aujourd'hui que “l'avenir de la justice pénale internationale se trouve sur le plan national”.
Pour mieux comprendre la relation entre les procès internationaux et nationaux, j'ai étudié trois cas africains. J'ai analysé le travail de la Cour pénale internationale en RDC, du Tribunal spécial pour la Sierra Leone et du Tribunal pénal international pour le Rwanda.
En m'appuyant sur plus de 200 entretiens avec des fonctionnaires gouvernementaux, des magistrats, des diplomates et des représentants de la société civile, j'ai évalué “les effets d'ombre” que les trois tribunaux internationaux ont eu sur les poursuites de crimes graves au niveau national.
Mes conclusions confirment que la recherche de la justice pour les crimes graves est complexe. Il ne faut pas s'attendre à des solutions simples et rapides lorsque des milliers de personnes sont victimes de graves violations des droits de l'homme. Mais sur la base de 30 ans d'interventions de la justice pénale internationale sur le continent africain, j'ai identifié quatre tendances. Celles-ci révèlent des opportunités et des défis dans la lutte mondiale contre l'impunité.
Tendances influençant les interventions internationales
Premièrement, les chiffres illustrent l'importance décroissante des procès internationaux. Les tribunaux du Rwanda et de la Yougoslavie avaient inculpé des centaines de personnes à partir du milieu des années 1990. Le tribunal spécial de la Sierra Leone a poursuivi 13 suspects dans les années 2000. Aujourd'hui, la Cour pénale internationale traite entre une et quatre affaires internationales par pays.
Deuxièmement, en raison des critiques contre les tribunaux pénaux internationaux dans les années 1990 et 2000, la communauté internationale s'est tournée vers les processus de justice au niveau national. Alors que le nombre de procès internationaux a diminué, les poursuites nationales ont augmenté dans certains pays. Mais le bilan est mitigé. Les centaines de procès nationaux au Rwanda et en RDC contrastent avec la (quasi) absence d'affaires en Sierra Leone.
Read more: Prosecution or compensation? What Kenyan choices tell us about international justice
Troisièmement, il n'est toujours pas évident que la justice nationale soit plus efficace que les tribunaux pénaux internationaux. Les donateurs et les ONG accordent de plus en plus la priorité aux initiatives de renforcement des capacités des magistrats et des avocats nationaux. Mais ils évitent les dimensions politiques des initiatives en matière de justice menées par les États. Les questions difficiles qu’ils doivent aborder sont les suivantes : pourquoi certains auteurs sont-ils poursuivis au niveau national et pas d’autres ? Quels procès nationaux sont inéquitables ? Quels effets les poursuites nationales sélectives ont-elles sur la construction de la nation ?
Par exemple, l’on applaudit à juste titre les centaines de procès devant les audiences foraines congolaises. En même temps, l'armée congolaise a utilisé le soutien international pour consolider son pouvoir au détriment du secteur de la justice civile. Les universitaires ont exprimé des préoccupations similaires quant aux conséquences involontaires du processus de justice interne au Rwanda.
Quatrièmement, la Cour pénale internationale était censée encourager une prise en compte nationale des crimes graves en jetant une “ombre positive” - autrement dit, en exerçant une influence positive - sur les juges, les procureurs et les avocats nationaux. En réalité, les procureurs et les juges internationaux de La Haye ont souvent adopté une interprétation frileuse de leurs pouvoirs, et ils ont souvent ignoré le travail - bon ou mauvais - de leurs homologues nationaux. Le risque est que cette pratique favorise des poursuites nationales sélectives qui renforcent le pouvoir (autoritaire) des élites dirigeantes dans des pays comme la RDC, la République centrafricaine, la Libye ou le Mali.
La voie à suivre
Il y a deux conclusions principales à tirer. Premièrement, les tribunaux pénaux internationaux jettent parfois involontairement une “ombre autoritaire” sur les efforts de la justice nationale. Deuxièmement, le fait d’accorder une trop grande importance aux procès nationaux peut favoriser les tendances illibérales dans certains pays. J'encourage un regard plus critique sur la manière dont la justice internationale et la justice nationale interagissent. Des formules simples comme “l'avenir de la justice pénale internationale se trouve sur le plan national” ne sont pas toujours utiles.
Mais ce livre est un appel à l'action plutôt qu'au désespoir. Il propose des stratégies pour surmonter les obstacles à la justice nationale. Il s'agit notamment de renforcer l'engagement de la société civile, la coopération avec les magistrats et policiers nationaux, ainsi que le suivi des procès nationaux.
En fin de compte, la lutte mondiale contre l'impunité reste un travail en cours. Il sera nécessaire de mener davantage d’analyses sur l’équilibre optimal entre les efforts de justice au niveau international et national.",La lutte contre l’impunité pour les crimes graves s'oriente vers des procès nationaux : voici les conclusions de mes recherches dans trois pays africains,Null
"_L’Unesco a approuvé l'inscription de l'île de Djerba sur la liste de son patrimoine mondial. Le site tunisien est réputé pour ses ruines antiques, ses villages blanchis à la chaux, ses mosquées, églises et synagogues. Aliou Niane de The Conversation Afrique a demandé à Najoua Tobji Ben Rejeb, chercheure en patrimoine environnemental et architectural, quelles étaient les spécificités du site qui ont poussé à cette décision et ses possibles retombées.
Pouvez-vous retracer l'historique du site ?
Ouverte sur la mer, Djerba, la plus grande île du sud de la Méditerranée, a connu depuis l'Antiquité une histoire agitée et mouvementée. Sa situation géographique dans le sud-est de la Tunisie lui a garanti un emplacement stratégique entre les deux rives du bassin méditerranéen et lui a permis de jouer, très tôt, les rôles de terre d'accueil et de plaque tournante marchande entre l'Afrique subsaharienne et l'Europe.
Par ailleurs, l'avènement de l'islam à Djerba a constitué un tournant décisif dans l'histoire de l'île, notamment à cause de la spécificité du rite ibadite embrassé par sa population.
Au XIe siècle, la société à Djerba, était organisée selon un système à dominance musulmane ibadite côtoyant des minorités juive et chrétienne; ce qui conférait à l’île un caractère multiconfessionnel. La communauté juive de l’île est considérée par bon nombre d’historiens parmi les plus anciennes, sinon la plus ancienne des communautés juives de l’Afrique du Nord.
Ces spécificités cultuelles et cultuelles de la société djerbienne ont engendré, en interaction avec d'autres paramètres comme l'insularité, les conjonctures historiques et le cadre physique, un paysage spécifique où le naturel alternait avec le bâti dans une symbiose exceptionnelle.
D'ailleurs, le bien en série “Djerba, témoignage d’un mode d’occupation d’un territoire insulaire” englobe :
cinq zones situées dans les vergers de l’île.
deux agglomérations urbaines, à savoir le village de Hara Sghira, le plus ancien des deux villages de la communauté juive de Djerba et le centre historique de Houmt-Souk.
22 mosquées, la synagogue la Ghriba et l’église Saint Nicolas, témoins de la cohabitation de trois communautés ayant des références identitaires et religieuses distinctes.
Pourquoi est-ce si crucial que le site soit désigné comme un site du patrimoine mondial ?
L'inscription du site sur cette liste du patrimoine mondial constitue une reconnaissance internationale de la valeur exceptionnelle de ce patrimoine et de l'importance de sa préservation et sa mise en valeur.
En effet, le patrimoine djerbien constitue le témoignage exceptionnel d’un schéma distinctif de peuplement et d’occupation du sol. Toutefois, ce modèle séculaire fait, aujourd'hui, face à des défis multiples.
Quels sont ces défis?
Aujourd'hui, Djerba est confrontée aux enjeux de la maîtrise de la croissance urbaine et des mutations qui peuvent en découler, notamment ceux touchant ses spécificités patrimoniales. Celles-ci se manifestent dans son architecture vernaculaire résultat d’une interaction efficiente entre le Djerbien et son environnement. Ces spécificités sont également perceptibles à travers le mode traditionnel d’occupation et d’exploitation de l’espace insulaire.
L'inscription de Djerba sur la liste de l'Unesco pourrait jouer un rôle déterminant dans sa sauvegarde et de sa mise en valeur. En effet, l'Etat tunisien, par le plan de gestion, un des principaux constituants du dossier, s'est engagé à prendre les mesures juridiques, scientifiques, techniques, administratives et financières adéquates pour protéger le bien.

Pourriez-vous expliquer les critères d'éligibilité à la liste du patrimoine mondial et comment ce site répond à ces critères ?
Selon la convention du patrimoine mondial “pour figurer sur la liste du patrimoine mondial, les sites doivent avoir une valeur universelle exceptionnelle et satisfaire à au moins un des dix critères de sélection”. L'authenticité, l'intégrité, la protection et la gestion des biens sont également des paramètres importants à considérer lors de l'élaboration d'un dossier d'inscription.
D'un autre coté, le document intitulé Les Orientations devant guider la mise en œuvre de la Convention du patrimoine mondial élaboré par le Comité du patrimoine mondial énumère les étapes et procédures nécessaires pour l'inscription de biens sur la prestigieuse liste de l'Unesco.
Le bien “Djerba, témoignage d’un mode d’occupation d’un territoire insulaire” est inscrit selon le critère V :
être un exemple éminent d’établissement humain traditionnel, de l’utilisation traditionnelle du territoire ou de la mer, qui soit représentatif d’une culture (ou de cultures), ou de l’interaction humaine avec l’environnement, spécialement quand celui-ci est devenu vulnérable sous l’impact d’une mutation irréversible.
La nature d'occupation du sol à Djerba est basée sur un système rural de morcellement du territoire. En effet, les Djerbiens ne se sont réunis ni autour d'une source d'eau ni autour d'une mosquée. Ils ont opté plutôt pour une répartition sur la totalité du territoire selon une logique défensive. La nature de la nappe phréatique et sa répartition ont contribué à l'adoption d'un habitat dispersé et incité au perfectionnement de système de citernes pour pallier le manque d'eau.
Ce système urbain exceptionnel était constitué de quartiers/Houma qui sont un ensemble composés de Menzels (domaines agricoles) auxquels mène un réseau de voies. Deux noyaux urbains constituent, quant à eux, une exception : il s’agit de Houmt-Souk, centre d’échange économique et commercial, et le village juif de Hara Sghira.
Djerba représente ainsi, selon Eric Falt, directeur du Bureau de l'Unesco pour le Maghreb :
un témoignage exceptionnel d'un schéma de peuplement unique et d'une adaptation humaine remarquable, à travers les siècles, aux contraintes d'un environnement marqué par la rareté de l'eau et de nombreuses menaces venues de la mer.
Ce paysage spécifique était également la résultante des périodes tumultueuses et sanglantes qu’avait connues Djerba depuis le haut moyen âge et qui avaient marqué de leur empreinte son paysage architectural et urbain.
Par ailleurs, le bien répond correctement aux conditions d’intégrité et d’authenticité et bénéficie d’un système adapté de protection et de gestion nécessaire pour la sauvegarde des attributs qui lui confèrent sa Valeur Universelle Exceptionnelle.
Selon le paragraphe 49 des _Orientations devant guider la mise en œuvre de la Convention du patrimoine mondial,
La valeur universelle exceptionnelle signifie une importance culturelle et/ou naturelle tellement exceptionnelle qu’elle transcende les frontières nationales et qu’elle présente le même caractère inestimable pour les générations actuelles et futures de l’ensemble de l’humanité.
Pouvez-vous nous expliquer le processus d'évaluation du site une fois qu'il est proposé pour cette distinction ?
L’Institut national du patrimoine (INP) a proposé en 2012, au nom de l'Etat tunisien, d'inscrire l’île de Djerba sur la liste indicative du Patrimoine mondial.
Depuis, une équipe d'experts tunisiens appartenant à divers domaines et spécialités a travaillé à l'élaboration d'un rapport scientifique et technique détaillé, afin de répondre à toutes les exigences formulées dans les orientations de l'Unesco. Les efforts de l'Association pour la sauvegarde de l'île de Djerba (ASSIDJE) ont été, d'ailleurs, déterminants dans l'avancement du dossier. Ce travail de longue haleine s'est achevé, le 1er février 2022, par le dépôt final et officiel du dossier au siège de l'Unesco.
En septembre 2022, une mission technique d’évaluation du (Conseil international des monuments et sites (ICOMOS) s’est rendue à Djerba afin d’examiner le bien et les questions liées à sa protection, sa gestion et sa conservation, ainsi que celles associées à son intégrité et son authenticité, et ce conformément aux exigences établies par les Orientations devant guider la mise en œuvre de la Convention du patrimoine mondial et son Annexe 6.
Les informations complémentaires fournies par l'Etat tunisien, ainsi que le rapport de mission et les études de documents ont été attentivement examinés par les membres de la Commission pour le patrimoine mondial de l’ICOMOS lors de la réunion de la Commission pour le patrimoine mondial de l’ICOMOS, qui s’est tenue à la fin du mois de novembre 2022.
Finalement, lors de la 45ème session du Comité du patrimoine mondial qui s'est déroulée à Riyad en Arabie Saoudite, le dossier de l’intégration du bien au patrimoine mondial de l’Unesco a été examiné et accepté.
Quelles seront les implications du nouveau statut du site ?
L'inscription d'un site sur la liste du patrimoine mondial signifie sa valeur exceptionnelle pour l'humanité et la nécessité de le préserver pour les générations futures. Elle vise également à sensibiliser la population locale sur l'importance de la préservation du bien. Cette quête constituera un moyen efficace pour assurer la cohésion sociale autour d'une cause commune, en l'occurrence la protection du patrimoine commun et sa mise en valeur.
Par ailleurs, le site sera davantage protégé par les instances nationales et locales. Ce label de prestige entraînera également une augmentation du tourisme, une appréciation de la culture locale et un développement durable dans la région.
Cette inscription ne fournit-elle pas des moyens financiers supplémentaires à l'Etat tunisien pour assurer la protection du site?
Pour aider financièrement les Etats parties à protéger les biens inscrits sur la liste du patrimoine mondial, l'Unesco a crée le Fonds du patrimoine mondial qui peut financer des projets concernant les biens inscrits. Cette assistance doit porter, soit sur l'assistance d'urgence ou la conservation et la gestion du bien. Pour bénéficier de cette aide financière, l'Etat tunisien doit, donc, soumettre une demande auprès du Centre du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco.",Djerba classé patrimoine mondial : un succès en forme de défi,Null
"Le changement climatique a eu des répercussions négatives, voire irréversibles dans certains cas, sur les écosystèmes du monde entier. Malheureusement, ce n'est pas le seul phénomène qui modifie notre milieu naturel.
En 2019, le rapport d'évaluation mondiale de la Plateforme intergouvernementale scientifique et politique sur la biodiversité et les services écosystémiques (IPBES) a confirmé que les espèces exotiques envahissantes sont l'une des cinq principales causes directes de l'appauvrissement de la biodiversité. Les autres sont le changement climatique, l'utilisation des terres et des mers, l'exploitation directe des espèces et la pollution.
L'IPBES, un organisme intergouvernemental indépendant, a été créée en 2012. Elle compte aujourd'hui 144 pays membres ; la Somalie, le membre le plus récent, y a adhéré à la mi-septembre. Son principal objectif est de renforcer la collaboration entre la science et la politique afin de conserver et d'utiliser durablement la biodiversité.
L'évaluation de 2019 a révélé que plus de 37 000 espèces exotiques ont été introduites par de nombreuses activités humaines dans des régions et des biomes du monde entier, la plupart au cours des 100 dernières années. Un nouveau rapport de l'organisation, axé sur les espèces exotiques envahissantes, suggère que ce nombre augmente rapidement, de nouvelles espèces exotiques étant enregistrées à un rythme sans précédent d'environ 200 par an. Il révèle également que le coût économique mondial des espèces exotiques envahissantes dépasse les 423 milliards de dollars par an. Les coûts ont au moins quadruplé à chaque décennie depuis 1970.
Mais le nouveau rapport ne se concentre pas uniquement sur les problèmes. Il propose également des solutions. Il présente des réponses clés et des options politiques que les gouvernements peuvent adopter pour la prévention, la détection précoce et le contrôle efficace des espèces exotiques envahissantes. Ce faisant, ils contribueront à préserver la nature et ce qu'elle apporte à l'homme. Cela garantira une meilleure qualité de vie pour tous.
Je suis une biologiste spécialiste des invasions dont les recherches portent sur l'écologie et la gestion des plantes aquatiques envahissantes. Je développe ici les quatre messages clés mis en avant par le rapport et que les pays africains devraient prendre en compte si le continent veut s'attaquer avec succès aux menaces posées par les espèces envahissantes.
Messages clés
1 : Les espèces exotiques envahissantes constituent une menace majeure pour la nature, ses contributions à l'homme et sa bonne qualité de vie.
En Afrique, les espèces envahissantes menacent la sécurité alimentaire en affectant négativement la production piscicole, la productivité agricole, les pâturages et l'approvisionnement en eau.
L'introduction de la perche du Nil, Lates niloticus, dans le lac Victoria, en Afrique de l'Est, en 1954, en est l'un des exemples les plus extrêmes. La prédation par cette espèce a provoqué l'extinction d'environ 200 espèces de cichlidés du lac. On considère qu'il s'agit de l'extinction la plus importante parmi les vertébrés au cours du 20e siècle.
L'invasion a également entraîné l'enrichissement du lac peu profond en nutriments, car les gens venaient y pêcher la perche du Nil. Cela a entraîné une invasion généralisée du lac par la jacinthe d'eau. La plante a restreint l'accès au lac, ce qui a empêché le transport et la pêche.
2 : Au niveau mondial, les espèces exotiques envahissantes et leurs impacts augmentent rapidement et devraient continuer à augmenter à l'avenir. Il est essentiel de disposer de données précises.
Une étude de 2021 a souligné que les coûts économiques rapportés des espèces aquatiques envahissantes étaient inégalement répartis entre les régions géographiques. L'Afrique, les îles de l'Océanie-Pacifique et l'Antarctique-Subantarctique ne représentent ensemble que 0,6 % de l'estimation mondiale de 345 milliards de dollars. Ce n'est pas parce que les coûts sont vraiment si bas. Les données ne sont tout simplement pas enregistrées, et nous ne disposons donc pas d'un tableau complet.
Les pays africains doivent s'associer à leurs voisins pour mieux quantifier la situation.
3 : Les espèces exotiques envahissantes et leur impact négatif ne peuvent être évités et atténués que par une gestion efficace.
En 2011, la Convention sur la diversité biologique a publié ses Objectifs d'Aichi pour la biodiversité. Les 20 objectifs ont été conçus pour lutter contre la perte de biodiversité et l'atténuer dans le monde entier. L'objectif 9 stipule que, d'ici 2020, les espèces exotiques envahissantes et leurs voies d'entrée doivent être identifiées et classées par ordre de priorité. Les espèces prioritaires doivent être contrôlées ou éradiquées, et des mesures doivent être prises pour bloquer les nouvelles voies d'entrée.
Mais aucun de ces objectifs n'a été atteint. Et certains pays africains n'ont enregistré que peu ou pas de progrès. Aujourd'hui, les espèces envahissantes sont présentées comme ayant un impact négatif sur les moyens de subsistance dans plus de 70 % des pays africains.
Les ressources financières limitées et le manque de cadres juridiques et de systèmes opérationnels connexes sont en grande partie responsables de l'absence de progrès. Par exemple, il y a un énorme déficit de capacité, principalement dans les ports d'entrée - qui sont l'étape la plus cruciale dans la prévention des invasions.
De nombreuses régions doivent encore améliorer leurs plans de gestion pour lutter efficacement contre les espèces envahissantes, en commençant par l'identification des espèces envahissantes communes.
4 : Il y a des exemples de réussite sur le continent : les leçons devraient être partagées au-delà des frontières.
En Afrique du Sud, la gestion des invasions de plantes exotiques a été activement soutenue par le programme gouvernemental Working for Water depuis 1995.

Une étude réalisée en 2022 a estimé qu'une moyenne de 310 millions de rands sud-africains (ajustée aux cours de 2020) avait été dépensée chaque année pour des travaux couvrant 2,7 millions d'hectares sur plus de 76 000 sites. Cela ne signifie pas que les invasions de plantes sont totalement maîtrisées. Mais il est clair que, sans ce type de programme, la situation serait bien pire.
L'étude recommande que les efforts futurs du programme se concentrent sur des sites prioritaires clairement définis, sur l'amélioration de la planification et du suivi et sur l'accroissement de l'efficacité opérationnelle. Ce sont là des leçons précieuses pour d'autres pays africains.
Un regard africain
Son nouveau rapport ne se concentre pas sur une région du monde en particulier, mais l'IPBES a déjà été claire sur l'importance de la biodiversité pour les nations africaines. Dans une évaluation régionale de 2018 sur la biodiversité et les services écosystémiques pour l'Afrique, l'organisation a indiqué que
La biodiversité et les contributions de la nature en Afrique sont économiquement, socialement et culturellement importantes, essentielles pour assurer l'alimentation, l'eau, l'énergie, la santé et la sécurité des moyens de subsistance du continent. Elles représentent un atout stratégique pour le développement durable et la réalisation des Objectifs de développement durable.
La plupart des données contenues dans le dernier rapport proviennent de l'hémisphère nord, car c'est là que sont menées la plupart des recherches et que provient la majorité des financements.
Les besoins varient d'un pays et d'une région à l'autre. C'est là que la valeur de la coordination régionale et du partage des connaissances devient évidente.",Les espèces exotiques envahissantes constituent une grave menace pour la planète : 4 messages clés pour l'Afrique,Null
"L'ancien footballeur malien Salif Këita alias Domingo, décédé le 2 septembre à Bamako, a incarné un moment de l’histoire du football africain et de son rapport au monde. Il a aussi contribué à éclairer par son jeu spectaculaire le football français dans une période difficile, tout en participant à la lutte des footballeurs pour leurs droits.
Né le 6 décembre 1946, l’année où est créée la Coupe de l’Afrique occidentale française (AOF), Salif Keita a aussi été un dirigeant qui compte du football malien.
Je suis enseignant-chercheur en histoire contemporaine. Mes thèmes de recherche portent, entre autres, sur l'histoire politique, culturelle et globale du football, le sport et politique.
C’est donc tout autant le joueur que l’homme qu’il faut rappeler après la disparition du grand attaquant au début de ce mois.
“Domingo”
Salif Keita naît en 1946 et grandit à Bamako, dans une famille de huit enfants. Il ne lui est pas aisé de faire comprendre à son père, transporteur de métier, qu’il préfère le ballon rond aux études, même s’il finit par obtenir un CAP (Certificat d'aptitude professionnelle) de rectificateur. Le football est d’abord une pratique informelle, avant d’être joué dans une équipe de quartiers, les Onze Diables de Ouolofobougouu, un quartier de Bamako.
À 14 ans, il rejoint le club des Pionniers, forme de scoutisme “progressiste” imitée des pays socialistes chers au président Modibo Keïta. Mais ses dribbles, son shoot, son jeu de tête le propulsent vite dans l’effectif du Real Bamako où il est connu sous le surnom de “Domingo”. Il joue et perd deux finales de Coupe d’Afrique des clubs champions, l’une avec le Real, l’autre avec le Stade Malien auquel il a été prêté pour l’occasion. Il fait également ses premiers pas dans la sélection nationale.
Partir en France
Salif Keïta vise plus haut encore. Par l’intermédiaire des réseaux post-coloniaux, il entre en contact avec les dirigeants de l’AS Saint-Etienne qui entretiennent de bonnes relations avec Charles Dagher, un commerçant libanais de Bamako. En septembre 1967, il gagne clandestinement le Libéria d’où il s’envole pour Orly, en France. Les dirigeants des “Verts” (surnom de l'AS Saint-Etienne) ne sont pas à l’aéroport et le jeune Salif doit héler un taxi qui le conduit directement au stade Geoffroy-Guichard.
Keïta n’est pas le premier joueur africain à être recruté par un club français. Toutefois, la porte largement ouverte dans les années 1950 aux footballeurs d’Afrique subsaharienne s'est en partie refermée. D’un côté, les fédérations africaines veulent garder leurs joueurs, de l’autre, le nombre d’étrangers alignés dans les équipes hexagonales est limité à deux. La Fédération malienne passe alors l’éponge sur sa “fuite” et adresse au mois de novembre suivant le certificat de transfert, sésame qui lui permet de jouer. Mais les clubs français préfèrent engager des footballeurs sud-américains ou yougoslaves.
Aux footballeurs africains, ils offrent des contrats léonins. Keita évolue d'abord sous le statut d’amateur, justifié par les dirigeants de l'époque par ses études de droit entamées en France. Il n’en touche pas moins de l’argent, avant de signer officiellement un contrat professionnel de quatre ans en 1969.
Les tribulations d’un footballeur africain en France
Même si l’hiver dans le Forez, région du Massif central en France est rude, Keita s’impose vite. Il peut d’abord compter sur les conseils de l’entraîneur Albert Batteux et les passes de Rachid Mekhloufi, le maître à jouer algérien des Verts. Au poste d’avant-centre ou de numéro 10, il marque 120 buts en 149 matches. En octobre 1969, c’est lui qui signe le but de la qualification contre le Bayern Munich en 16e de finale de la Coupe des champions.
Avec l’AS Saint-Etienne, il remporte trois titres de champion et une Coupe de France. En 1970, ses performances lui valent d’être le premier récipiendaire du Ballon d’or africain décerné par l’hebdomadaire France Football. Désireux de changer d’air, il cherche à résilier son contrat. Un contentieux juridique violent l’oppose alors à Roger Rocher, le président de l’AS Saint-Etienne.
Suspendu six mois mais soutenu par de nombreux supporters, il s’engage avec l’Olympique de Marseille en novembre 1972. Bien vite, il est à nouveau en butte aux exigences de dirigeants qui veulent le faire naturaliser pour pouvoir l’aligner aux côtés des deux vedettes étrangères mais européennes, Josip Skoblar et Roger Magnusson. Mais Salif Keïta refuse ce qu’il considère comme une atteinte à sa dignité d’homme et d’Africain, et fait dès lors l’objet d’une cabale de la presse locale aux forts relents racistes.
Du monde au pays
Il part ensuite pour Valence (1973-1975), où Alfredo Di Stefano l’a fait venir. L’Espagne n’est pas encore le parangon du beau jeu, mais Keïta retrouve le chemin des filets jusqu’à ce qu’il se blesse en mars 1975. Les dirigeants valenciens désirent alors le transférer pour recruter l’Argentin Mario Kempes. Fidèle à sa ligne de conduite, il défend ses intérêts sportifs et financiers, et n’accepte de partir qu’à condition que lui soit versée l’année de salaire qui lui est due et que le club paye ses impôts ! Salif Keïta gagne alors le championnat portugais, un football qui s’est aussi révélé au monde grâce à ses vedettes d'origine africaine africaines comme Eusebio ou Mario Coluna.
À 31 ans, au Sporting Club de Lisbonne, il finit par trouver un environnement sportif dans lequel il s’épanouit. Il remporte une coupe du Portugal, avant de disputer une dernière saison aux États-Unis en 1979-1980. Keïta se retire quand le football africain commence à se révéler au monde. Sa vie inspire le film du réalisateur Cheik Doukouré Le Ballon d’or (1994), dans lequel il interprète le rôle de l’entraîneur du jeune Bandian.
Après avoir été ministre délégué auprès du Premier ministre chargé de l'initiative privée en 1991, après la chute de Moussa Traoré, il ouvre un centre de formation à Bamako. Il est ensuite élu président de la Fédération malienne (2005-2009). Mais la France ne l’a pas oublié. Moins rancuniers que Roger Rocher, les dirigeants stéphanois l’érigent au rang d’ambassadeur de l’AS Saint-Etienne et deux stades portent son nom à Saint-Etienne et Cergy-Pontoise. Une autre manière d’honorer un très grand attaquant et un homme déterminé à faire valoir ses droits dans un milieu encore marqué par une certaine condescendance à l’égard de l’Afrique.",Décès de Salif Keïta : un pan de l'histoire du football africain s'en est allé,Null
"Les pays d'Afrique subsaharienne ont fait des progrès remarquables vers la scolarisation universelle au cours des 25 dernières années. Dans l'ensemble de la région, 8 enfants sur 10 en âge de fréquenter l'école primaire sont désormais scolarisés, et dans des pays comme le Bénin et Madagascar, ce chiffre s'élève à près de 10 enfants sur 10.
Cependant, il devient de plus en plus évident que de nombreux enfants de la région apprennent très peu à l'école. Cette “crise de l'apprentissage” signifie qu'il sera difficile d'atteindre l’objectif de développement durable des Nations unies d'une éducation de qualité pour tous d'ici 2030.
Il est important de noter que la crise de l'apprentissage ne touche pas tous les pays de la même manière. Par exemple, une étude récente a révélé que près de la moitié des élèves de sixième année (qui ont en moyenne 13 ans) au Niger ont des difficultés à lire une phrase simple, alors qu'au Burkina Faso, pays voisin, seul un élève de sixième année sur dix a de tels problèmes. Cela soulève la question de savoir ce qui explique ces écarts d'apprentissage entre pays.
Dans une étude récente, mes coauteurs Natalie Irmert, Mohammad H. Sepahvand et moi-même avons tenté de répondre à cette question. Nous avons émis l'hypothèse que les différences de qualité des enseignants entre les pays jouent un rôle. En utilisant des données comparables provenant de 14 pays d'Afrique subsaharienne francophone, nous avons constaté que les différences dans les connaissances disciplinaires des enseignants - c'est-à-dire leur maîtrise de la matière qu'ils sont censés enseigner - expliquent plus d'un tiers des différences de niveaux de l'apprentissage des élèves.
Cela signifie que les très faibles niveaux d'apprentissage dans les écoles de certains pays sont en grande partie dus à un manque d'enseignants compétents.
La recherche
Notre étude a été rendue possible par la publication récente des données de l’évaluation PASEC 2019. Cette évaluation a comparé les compétences en lecture et en mathématiques des élèves de sixième année dans 14 pays d'Afrique francophone. Ce qui est important pour nous, c'est qu'elle a également mesuré les connaissances des enseignants de ces élèves dans les deux mêmes matières. L'évaluation a révélé de très grandes différences dans les compétences moyennes des élèves en lecture et en mathématiques d'un pays à l'autre.
Read more: Collaboration is helping teachers in rural Cameroon fill knowledge gaps
Dans notre étude, nous avons cherché à savoir si ces différences entre pays dans les compétences des élèves étaient dues à des lacunes dans les connaissances des enseignants dans les disciplines. Nous avons émis l'hypothèse que cela pourrait être le cas sur la base de recherches antérieures menées dans les différents pays, qui montrent que la qualité des enseignants est un facteur clé de l'apprentissage.
Nos résultats ont montré que les compétences des élèves et les connaissances disciplinaires des enseignants étaient en effet positivement corrélées : de meilleures connaissances des enseignants tendaient à aller de pair avec de meilleures compétences des élèves.
Toutefois, cela ne signifie pas nécessairement que les connaissances disciplinaires des enseignants sont à l'origine de l'apprentissage. Par exemple, les pays où les enseignants sont plus compétents peuvent également investir davantage dans les infrastructures scolaires. Dans ce cas, la corrélation positive entre les connaissances des enseignants et les compétences des élèves pourrait simplement refléter les meilleures conditions d'apprentissage dues à l'amélioration des infrastructures scolaires.
Explication des différences
Pour être sûrs que notre comparaison reflète un effet causal des connaissances des enseignants, nous avons utilisé une astuce statistique : nous avons comparé les compétences des élèves et les connaissances des enseignants en lecture de chaque pays avec les compétences des élèves et les connaissances des enseignants en mathématiques.
Read more: Girls thrive with women teachers: a study in Francophone Africa
Cela signifie que nous avons pu maintenir constants tous les facteurs qui ne différaient pas entre les deux sujets, tels que la qualité des infrastructures scolaires. Si de meilleures connaissances des enseignants en lecture par rapport aux mathématiques tendaient à aller de pair avec de meilleures compétences des élèves en lecture par rapport aux mathématiques, nous pourrions être certains que l'effet des connaissances des enseignants en était la cause.
La figure ci-dessous montre que c'est effectivement le cas : par exemple, les enseignants du Burundi ont obtenu des résultats relativement faibles au test de lecture par rapport au test de mathématiques et, par conséquent, leurs élèves ont obtenu de moins bons résultats à l'évaluation de la lecture qu'à l'évaluation des mathématiques. En revanche, les enseignants du Gabon avaient relativement plus de connaissances en lecture et, par conséquent, leurs élèves ont également obtenu de meilleurs résultats au test de lecture.
Les connaissances des enseignants dans la matière renforcent les compétences des élèves Image des auteurs
Dans l'ensemble, les différences dans les connaissances des disciplines entre enseignants pourraient expliquer un tiers des différences des niveaux des élèves entre les 14 pays. Nos données ne nous ont pas permis de déterminer les facteurs qui expliquent les deux tiers restants de ces différences.
Implications pour les décideurs
Nos résultats montrent que la qualité des enseignants, et en particulier leur connaissance de la matière, est un facteur déterminant des différences de niveaux entre les pays. Cette constatation est importante pour les décideurs politiques d'Afrique subsaharienne qui tentent de résoudre la “crise de l'apprentissage” : elle montre qu'il est très rentable de recruter des enseignants plus compétents.
En outre, une formation en cours d'emploi qui améliore les connaissances des enseignants déjà en poste pourrait entraîner des gains importants dans l'apprentissage des élèves.",La réussite scolaire dépend du niveau de connaissances des enseignants : les enseignements de 14 pays francophones d'Afrique,Null
"L’assassinat apparent d'Evgueni Prigojine dans le crash de son jet privé entre Moscou et Saint-Pétersbourg marque un tournant dans les relations russo-africaines. Prigojine, en tant que dirigeant du tristement célèbre groupe Wagner, était l'homme de confiance de la Russie en Afrique depuis que Wagner a commencé ses opérations sur le continent en 2017. Plus qu'une entité unique, le groupe Wagner est une fusion des sociétés écrans déployant des forces paramilitaires, de la désinformation et de l'ingérence politique en Ukraine, en Syrie et en Afrique. Ses dirigeants ont été sanctionnés par 30 pays pour les activités déstabilisatrices du groupe.
On pensait que Prigojine vivait sur du temps emprunté après avoir mené une insurrection de courte durée - dans le cadre d'une lutte de pouvoir avec les leaders militaires russes- en juin. Bien qu'il ait rapidement fait marche arrière, cette action a mis le président russe Vladimir Poutine dans l'embarras et a suscité des spéculations selon lesquelles la faiblesse supposée de M. Poutine encouragerait d'autres frondeurs à défier son autorité.
Prigojine a renforcé l'influence russse en Afrique en soutenant des dirigeants autoritaires politiquement isolés et impopulaires. Grâce au soutien de Wagner, ces dirigeants étaientredevables aux intérêts russes. Le soutien de Wagner a pris diverses formes irrégulières, telles que des forces paramilitaires, des campagnes de désinformation, des interférences électorales, l'intimidation d'opposants politiques et des contrats d'échange d'armes contre des ressources. Prigojine a fait référence à cet ensemble d'opérations d'influence imbriquées sous le nom de “l'Orchestre”, qu'il a dirigé.
Wagner a déployé des forces en Libye, en République centrafricaine, au Mali et au Soudan. Il s'est également immiscé dans la politique intérieure et les récits d'information dans quelque deux douzaines de pays africains.
J'étudie le rôle de la gouvernance dans la promotion de la sécurité et du développement ainsi que l'influence des acteurs extérieurs en Afrique, y compris la Russie. Les transitions démocratiques et les institutions de responsabilité démocratique font partie de mes centres d'intérêt.
L'ampleur de l'ingérence politique russe en Afrique met en évidence les objectifs stratégiques de la Russie pour le continent. Elle vise à s'implanter en Afrique du Nord et dans la mer Rouge, à saper l'influence occidentale, à normaliser l'autoritarisme et à évincer le système international fondé sur les Nations unies.
Aucun de ces objectifs ne vise à rendre l'Afrique plus prospère ou plus stable. Au contraire, le continent est avant tout un théâtre pour promouvoir les intérêts géostratégiques de la Russie.
En tentant de maintenir les opérations lucratives et influentes du groupe Wagner en Afrique après la mort de Prigojine, la Russie aura du mal à nier qu'elle a recours à des actions irrégulières et illégales pour étendre son influence.
Maintenir Wagner sans Prigojine
Le modèle Wagner a permis à l'influence russe de s'étendre rapidement en Afrique. Et ce, bien que la Russie n'investisse que très peu sur le continent. La plupart des coûts de Wagner ont été couverts par des liquidités et des concessions minières fournies par les régimes hôtes. D'après certains témoignages, les revenus des opérations minières en République centrafricaine et au Soudan se chiffrent en milliards.
Il n'est pas surprenant que la Russie veuille poursuivre l'entreprise Wagner. Fait révélateur, le jour de l'accident d'avion de Prigojine, le vice-ministre de la défense Yunus-Bek Yevkurov était en Libye pour rassurer le chef de guerre Khalifa Haftar sur le soutien continu de la Russie. Yevkurov s'est ensuite rendu auprès des juntes militaires du Mali et du Burkina Faso pour leur transmettre le même message.
La question est de savoir si l'armée russe en a la capacité. La Russie a besoin de soldats en Ukraine. Il se peut donc qu'elle n'ait pas de combattants expérimentés à envoyer en Afrique. On peut également se demander si les troupes Wagner accepteront de signer des contrats avec le ministère russe de la défense, compte tenu de la manière dont leur chef a été éliminé.
Le gouvernement russe devrait également recréer les transactions multidimensionnelles qui ont permis aux opérations de Wagner de consolider les régimes clients. Pendant des années, la Russie a encouragé la guerre hybride - la fusion d'instruments conventionnels et subversifs. La synchronisation de ces instruments dans de multiples contextes africains nécessitera une plus grande dextérité que celle dont la bureaucratie sécuritaire russe est vraisemblablement capable.
Enfin, la Russie a bénéficié du déni plausible que Wagner a fourni tout en faisant le travail de Poutine. Dans tous les contextes où les forces de Wagner ont été déployées, elles ont été accusées de manière crédible de violations des droits de l'homme, notamment de viols, de tortures et d'exécutions extrajudiciaires. Au Mali, Wagner est lié à plus de 320 incidents de violations des droits de l'homme et à des centaines de morts civiles. Wagner a également été accusée de chasser les communautés locales là où elle a obtenu des concessions minières, annexant de fait des territoires africains.
En prenant directement en charge les opérations de Wagner en Afrique, le gouvernement russe ne peut plus feindre l'ignorance ou prétendre être impuissant face.à ces actions illégales et déstabilisantes. La Russie a échappé à payer pour les coûts liés à sa réputation causée par les activités illégales de Wagner en Afrique. Mais cela changera lorsqu'elle assumera les tactiques répressives déployées par Wagner.
Réévaluations en Afrique
Qu'en est-il des clients africains de Wagner ? Les dirigeants de ces régimes sont arrivés au pouvoir par des moyens extraconstitutionnels. Ils imposent des restrictions à l'opposition et aux médias. Ils sont isolés sur le plan international. En d'autres termes, ils ne peuvent survivre sans le soutien de Moscou. Il ne faut donc pas s'attendre à un changement de réceptivité de la part des juntes militaires du Mali, du Soudan, du Burkina Faso, des dirigeants cooptés de la République centrafricaine ou du chef de guerre libyen Haftar.
Ce qui sera révélateur, c'est la réaction des autres gouvernements du continent. Certains continueront à considérer qu'il est utile de flirter avec la Russie pour se prémunir contre les critiques internationales.
Toutefois, l'influence de la Russie en Afrique est peut-être en train de dépasser ses capacités. Le continent prend de plus en plus conscience du peu que la Russie apporte réellement à l'Afrique en termes d'investissement, de commerce, de création d'emplois ou de sécurité. Le déploiement de mercenaires, la désinformation, l'ingérence politique et les contrats d'échange d'armes contre des ressources ont pour effet d'amplifier l'instabilité sur le continent.
Le symbolisme de cette situation a été clairement mis en évidence dans les jours qui ont précédé le Sommet Russie-Afrique à la fin du mois de juillet.
La Russie s'est retirée de l'accord sur les céréales de la mer Noire ) qui avait permis d'acheminer 33 millions de tonnes de céréales de l'Ukraine vers l'Afrique et d'autres régions du monde. Cet accord avait permis d'alléger les restrictions de la chaîne d'approvisionnement causées par l'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Russie en 2022. La Russie n'a pas seulement sabordé l'accord : elle a bombardé les ports ukrainiens qui exportaient les céréales, gaspillant ainsi 180 000 tonnes. Il est difficile d'ignorer le mépris dont Poutine a fait preuve à l'égard des intérêts africains en agissant de la sorte.
Ce mépris, associé à la reconnaissance du fait que la Russie offre relativement peu à l'Afrique, a contribué à ce que seulement 17 chefs d'État africains assistent au sommet de Saint-Pétersbourg. À titre de comparaison, 43 chefs d'État africains ont assisté au sommet Russie-Afrique qui s'est tenu à Sotchi en 2019.
La façon dont Prigojine a été éliminé doit également faire réfléchir les dirigeants africains.
Poutine parle souvent de son désir de créer un nouvel ordre international. L'anarchie qui règne en Russie, tant à l'intérieur qu'à l'extérieur du pays, met en lumière ce à quoi ressemblerait cet ordre mondial. Et cette vision n'est pas partagée par de nombreux dirigeants africains.",Russie en Afrique : la mort de Prigojine dévoile les véritables motifs de Poutine sur le continent,Null
"Plus de 11 000 personnes ont été tuées et des dizaines de milliers sont portées disparues à la suite de l'effondrement catastrophique de deux barrages dans la ville de Derna, dans l'est de la Libye. L'effondrement du barrage s'est produit après qu'une tempête extrême, la tempête Daniel, s'est abattue sur ce pays d'Afrique du Nord. Moina Spooner, de The Conversation Africa, a demandé à Nadhir Al-Ansari, expert en ressources en eau et en ingénierie, qui a effectué des recherches sur la conception et la sécurité des barrages, d'apporter des éclairages sur cette catastrophe.
Comment les conditions météorologiques extrêmes affectent-elles la stabilité des barrages ?
Les barrages sont généralement construits pour résister à de fortes précipitations ou à la sécheresse. La conception et la construction d'un barrage tiennent compte de tous les effets possibles. Tous les facteurs sont pris en considération lors de la planification d'un barrage, notamment le type de matériaux de construction, la conception des fondations et la stabilité d'un barrage, ainsi que les inondations et les tremblements de terre prévus, voire même les opérations militaires.
Outre la construction du barrage, des mesures de sécurité doivent être mises en place. Par exemple, en cas de tempête, les ingénieurs doivent libérer l'eau pour s'assurer que la capacité de stockage maximale du barrage n'est pas dépassée.
Dans le cas de la Libye, je pense que la gestion des barrages n'était pas adéquate. L'ingénieur responsable du barrage aurait dû s'assurer que l'eau ne dépassait pas la capacité de stockage maximale du barrage. Lorsqu'il a remarqué qu'un énorme volume d'eau entrait dans le réservoir, il aurait dû libérer de grandes quantités d'eau pour maintenir le niveau du réservoir en dessous de sa limite maximale.
Les recherches montrent que les principales causes de défaillance des barrages sont les problèmes de fondation (40 %), un déversoir inadéquat (23 %), une mauvaise construction (12 %) et un tassement irrégulier (10 %). Le site d'un barrage n'est pas toujours plat, car les barrages sont construits dans des zones montagneuses, mais les concepteurs doivent en tenir compte. La conception du barrage doit être adaptée à la topographie. Parmi les causes plus rares de rupture de barrage, on trouve les actes de guerre (3 %), les matériaux défectueux (2 %) et les tremblements de terre (1 %).
Dans le cas de la Libye, une mauvaise gestion semble avoir été la cause de l'effondrement du barrage.
Cette tragédie aurait-elle pu être évitée ?
Oui, si les responsables de l'exploitation des barrages avaient ouvert les vannes pour libérer l'eau. Lorsque les responsables de la gestion de l'eau du barrage ignorent les fortes précipitations, on peut s'attendre à ce que de telles catastrophes se produisent.
Les gestionnaires de barrages doivent également connaître la zone de captage de chaque barrage et les prévisions de précipitations. Cela nécessite une coordination entre les météorologues et le personnel responsable de la gestion des barrages. Lorsque de fortes précipitations sont attendues, le service météorologique doit en informer les gestionnaires des barrages, qui peuvent alors prendre des dispositions pour libérer de l'eau afin de les maintenir dans leurs limites opérationnelles. C'est la pratique habituelle dans tous les barrages que j'ai étudiés en Irak.
En l'occurrence, il doit y avoir eu un dysfonctionnement dans la communication entre les services de météorologie et les ingénieurs chargés de la gestion des barrages.
Comment les ingénieurs et les autorités contrôlent-ils généralement l'intégrité structurelle des barrages ?
Les barrages doivent bénéficier d'un programme d'inspection régulier qui prend en compte toutes les parties du barrage. Tous les pays dotés de barrages, qu'il s'agisse États-Unis, de l'Irak ou de la Suède, effectuent des inspections régulières. Il devrait y avoir des instruments pour surveiller les fissures dans les parois d'un barrage et tout changement dans sa structure. Une fois identifiés, ils doivent faire l'objet d'une intervention immédiate.
Dans le cas de la Libye, si les vannes avaient été ouvertes pour maintenir l'eau dans les limites de la capacité de stockage du barrage, l'effondrement des barrages aurait causé moins de dégâts.
Existe-t-il de nouvelles technologies ou des innovations permettant d'améliorer la sécurité ?
Il existe un certain nombre de modèles et de techniques, et chaque barrage dispose de son propre modèle ou sa propre technique que le concepteur propose. La planification des événements météorologiques extrêmes se fait généralement dans la phase de conception du barrage. Le concepteur est censé fournir un rapport détaillé sur la stabilité du barrage en fonction de différents facteurs, y compris les conditions météorologiques.
Différents scénarios sont établis en fonction du niveau d'eau dans le réservoir du barrage afin d'éviter des défaillances. Le gouvernement concerné doit savoir ce qu'il faut faire en cas de défaillance du barrage, en s'appuyant sur les informations fournies par le concepteur. Par exemple, dans mon étude du barrage irakien de Mossoul, qui a eu lieu après la construction du barrage, j'ai suggéré qu'un barrage de protection soit construit en aval pour assurer la sécurité de la zone en aval et de sa population. Des mesures de sécurité peuvent être prises même après la construction du barrage.
Les autres mesures de sécurité concernent les habitations et les autres constructions dans les zones situées en aval. Dans le cas de la Libye, il y a eu une mauvaise planification. Les zones situées en aval des barrages n'auraient pas dû être utilisées pour la construction d'habitations.
En définitive, la rupture du barrage en Libye aurait pu être évitée, ou du moins les pertes auraient pu être minimisées, si les ingénieurs sur place avaient libéré l'eau du réservoir dès le début de la tempête.",Effondrement des barrages en Libye : un expert en ingénierie s'interroge sur la gestion de l'ouvrage,Null
"La vente des droits de télévision est la principale source de revenus pour les organisations de football dans le monde entier, mais elle revêt une importance particulière en Afrique. Pourtant, la Confédération africaine de football (Caf) ne cesse de faire la une des journaux pour avoir renvoyé ses diffuseurs partenaires. Elle risque des poursuites judiciaires pour avoir récemment résilié un contrat de 415 millions de dollars avec la société qatarie beIN Sports, le deuxième contrat de télévision en quatre ans que l'instance dirigeante du football africain a unilatéralement annulé. Nous avons demandé à Chuka Onwumechili, expert en communication sportive et médias, de nous expliquer les raisons de cette décision et son impact.
Quelle est l'importance des droits de télévision pour le football africain?
Les droits de télévision sont particulièrement importants car les autres recettes commerciales, telles que les parrainages et le merchandising, sont plus limitées en Afrique.
L'accès à ces contrats de diffusion fournit des fonds essentiels qui permettent de contribuer à développer et à soutenir le football africain à différents niveaux, y compris l'administration et le financement des associations nationales et des joueurs.
En outre, sans ces accords de diffusion, les téléspecteurs du monde entier qui connaissent bien les grandes stars africaines qui jouent en Europe ne peuvent pas voir ces joueurs jouer pour leur pays d'origine.
Quel était le contrat avec beIN ?
Le contrat a été signé en 2017 et devait durer 12 ans, jusqu'en 2028. Il permettait à trois compétitions de la Caf - la Coupe d'Afrique des Nations (Can), la Ligue des champions de la Caf et la Coupe de la Confédération de la Caf - d'être diffusées en direct dans 40 pays à travers le monde, y compris le Moyen-Orient, l'Europe et les États-Unis.
La relation entre la Caf et beIN Sports a débuté en 2009. BeIN est devenu le partenaire principal de la Caf après le désaccord de la Caf avec Lagardère Sports and Entertainment en 2019 et la résiliation de ce contrat. La Caf a maintenant résilié le contrat avec BeIN également.
La Caf se retrouve donc potentiellement sans partenaire de diffusion sur des marchés clés. Ce blakc-out médiatique devrait se produire quelques mois avant la Can, le tournoi phare de la Caf, qui devrait être accueilli par la Côte d'Ivoire en janvier 2024. Des matches de qualification pour la Coupe du monde et des compétitions continentales de clubs sont également prévus prochainement.
Comment cela affectera-t-il les supporters ?
Les supporters du monde entier ne pourront pas regarder leurs idoles en direct à la télévision. L'intérêt pour le football africain, qui a attiré de plus en plus d'attention ces dernières années, s'en ressentira.
Comment les contrats de la Caf sont-ils par rapport aux autres dans le monde ?
Le contrat de la Caf avec beIN est une exclusivité : un seul grand diffuseur détient les droits pour tous les grands tournois. La plupart des confédérations mondiales autorisent la concurrence entre les diffuseurs, chacun se voyant attribuer une partie d'un tournoi. Par exemple, en Europe, les droits de la Ligue des champions sont répartis entre différents radiodiffuseurs. Dans d'autres cas, les différents tournois de la région sont attribués à des diffuseurs différents.

L'approche de la Caf consistant à distribuer un seul contrat d'exclusivité a été au cœur de la contestation juridique de l'Autorité égyptienne de la concurrence en 2019 concernant le contrat de droits médiatiques de la Caf avec Lagardère. En conséquence, la Caf a annulé le contrat d'un milliard de dollars avec la société française, citant le manque de concurrence comme l'une des raisons. Un sous-traitant, SuperSport, s'est également retiré du contrat, laissant la majeure partie de l'Afrique dans l'incapacité d'accéder aux matchs continentaux importants à la télévision. Le retrait de la Caf de l'accord avec Lagardère aurait coûté 50 millions de dollars.
Que s'est-il passé dans cette dernière affaire ?
La CAF invoque une rupture de contrat, y compris une prétendue dette impayée de 80 millions de dollars de la part de beIN.
Mais beIN menace de traduire la CAF devant les tribunaux. Il soutient que la Caf a pris la décision de résilier le contrat en violation de ses propres procédures internes.

La société estime qu'elle a droit à 80 millions de dollars qu'elle s'abstient de payer à la Caf, arguant qu'elle a souffert de l'impact de la Can qui a été reportée deux fois au dernier moment - d'abord à cause du COVID-19 et ensuite à cause de la météo - et que la Caf a jusqu'à présent rejeté la réévaluation de la valeur du contrat. (Dans des situations similaires dans d'autres confédérations, les accords ont été réévalués - par exemple, Sky Sports a reçuune remise de 213,5 millions de dollars de la part de la Premier League anglaise en raison des perturbations causées par le COVID).
BeIN affirme également que l'annonce par la Caf d'un nouveau tournoi de clubs Super Ligue africaine  en 2022 a conduit à une sous-évaluation de l'accord.
Les ruptures de contrats de ce type sont-elles inhabituelles dans le monde du football ?
Non. La Confédération asiatique de football a annulé les droits médiatiques accordés à Eleven Sports pour la restructuration de ses activités en Asie. La confédération a également résilié un accord avec la société chinoise LeSports pour avoir pris du retard dans ses paiements. En 2020, la Confédération sud-américaine de football a poursuivi TV Globo pour 120 millions de dollars en raison de redevances impayées.
Read more: The African football TV blackout could last for a while
Mais les deux résiliations de contrat de la Caf sont fondées sur des raisons différentes : une violation des lois sur la concurrence et un différend sur la valeur du contrat.
Comment la Caf devrait-elle modifier sa façon de gérer les droits de télévision ?
La Caf doit maintenant chercher à négocier de nouveaux contrats similaires à ceux négociés par d'autres confédérations. Par exemple, il pourrait y avoir des diffuseurs distincts pour chacune des compétitions de haut niveau du continent, y compris la nouvelle Super Ligue africaine.
Les nouveaux accords devraient éviter les clauses de monopole qui affectent radicalement la couverture de tous les matchs continentaux en cas de désaccord ou de renégociation des contrats.",Les amateurs de football africains ne pourront pas regarder les grands matches à la télévision : ce qui a mal tourné et comment y remédier,arts + culture
"Le coup d'État au Niger, le 26 juillet, a été une surprise tant pour les Nigériens que pour le reste du monde. Cette surprise peut s'expliquer par trois raisons.
La première concerne le fait qu'aucun événement ou situation récent (attentat terroriste, tension sociale, blocage politique, etc.) n'était susceptible de déboucher sur un coup de force.
La deuxième raison est que de nombreux Nigériens pensaient qu'un coup d'État avait peu de chances d’aboutir, car le parti au pouvoir avait réussi à contrecarrer plusieurs tentatives.
La troisième et dernière raison est la forte présence de troupes étrangères (françaises et américaines) sur le territoire nigérien. Cela pouvait laisser penser que ces puissances étrangères feraient tout pour éviter un scénario malien ou burkinabé au Niger. De ce point de vue, la particularité de ce coup d'État est d'avoir interrompu la première transition démocratique d'un président élu à un autre président élu au suffrage universel.
Le caractère surprenant et le contexte dans lequel s'est déroulé le coup d'État du 26 juillet, ont engendré toutes sortes de théories du complot et des rumeurs, dans les rues de Niamey et dans les médias étrangers, pour tenter d'en expliquer les raisons. Parmi les versions qui circulent, figure celle accusant la Russie ou le groupe Wagner, d'avoir fomenté le putsch ou l'ancien président Issoufou Mahamadou d'être complice de Abdourahmane Tchiani en raison de leur proximité.
En tant que chercheurs travaillant sur les dynamiques sociales et politiques au Sahel, nous pensons que pour analyser les raisons réelles qui ont conduit à ce putsch, il faut comprendre la relation entre le président Mohamed Bazoum et le commandant de la garde présidentielle Tchiani, et le lien que ces deniers entretiennent avec leur mentor, l'ancien président Issoufou Mahamadou.
De l'opposition politique au pouvoir
Issoufou Mahamadou est le président du Parti nigérien pour la démocratie et le socialisme (PNDS-Tarayya) depuis sa création en 1990. Il a réussi à constituer un large cercle de partisans et un vaste réseau à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur du pays, faisant de lui l'un des principaux acteurs de la vie politique nigérienne.
Issoufou a également réussi à faire de sa région natale Tahoua, située dans le nord-ouest du pays, non loin de la frontière malienne, son principal fief politique. Bazoum, qui était la deuxième personnalité du parti depuis sa création, avait gardé un profil bas dans le parti. Ce qui a empêché toute division au sein de cette organisation. Bazoum, a plusieurs fois déclaré, son entière confiance et sa ferme fidélité à Issoufou Mahamadou.
Bazoum a toutes les raisons d'afficher sa loyauté, envers celui qui l'a imposé comme candidat à sa succession, malgré l'opposition d'une frange du parti. L'opposition a aussi attaqué la candidature de Bazoum à la justice, soulevant la question d’éligibilité liée à l'authenticité de son certificat de naissance.
Une fois au pouvoir, Bazoum s'est retrouvé piégé par les ingérences de son prédécesseur. Mahamadou Issoufou a toujours voulu garder la main sur le pouvoir. Malgré ses deux mandats à la tête de l'État (2011-2021), il a maintenu ses proches aux postes clés de l'État, après l'accession de Bazoum au pouvoir. L'exemple le plus illustratif est le cas de son fils Sani Issoufou, qui détenait le portefeuille du ministère des mines et du pétrole dans le gouvernement d'Ouhoumoud Mahamadou.
Ce dernier, est aussi un des fidèles d'Issoufou. De plus, dans ses discours, Bazoum a toujours insisté sur la continuité de la gestion d'Issoufou en qualifiant son mandat de “renaissance acte trois”. Mais dans ses actions, il s'est démarqué de la politique de son successeur en faisant de la lutte contre les détournements de deniers publics sa priorité et en changeant la politique sécuritaire du pays.
Se défaire de l'étau
Cette nouvelle politique a suscité le mécontentement au sein de son parti, notamment certains milieux d'affaires qui ont vu leurs intérêts menacés. C'est par exemple, sur instruction du président Bazoum, que certaines personnes proches de l'ancien régime Issouffou ont été traduites en justice pour détournement de fonds publics.
Sur le plan sécuritaire, il y a eu l'arrivée massive de militaires français, mais aussi de nouveaux acteurs civils au palais présidentiel, désormais en charge des questions de sécurité, comme son conseiller spécial avec rang de ministre, l'ancien chef rebelle touareg, Rhissa Ag Boula. Cette nouvelle approche sur le plan sécuritaire, a engendré un malaise au sein de l'armée qui s'est vue reléguée au second plan. Bien avant le coup d'État, certains hommes d'affaires proches du parti au pouvoir ont fait part de leur mécontentement, face à la gestion de Bazoum, car ils n'avaient plus accès aux marchés publics comme c'était le cas à l'époque d'Issoufou.
Bazoum comptait s'appuyer sur des acteurs locaux et des partenaires extérieurs, pour assurer la sécurité de son pays. Une démarche mal accueillie par l'armée, et au premier rang le commandant de la garde présidentielle, qui a eu du mal à accepter le nouveau changement de politique de son nouveau patron.
Plusieurs sources ont indiqué que le commandant de la garde présidentielle, le général de brigade Tchiani, qui se voyait de plus en plus exclu de la gestion de l'Etat, s'en est plaint à son véritable chef, l'ancien president Issoufou Mahamadou qui l'a maintenu à son poste qu'il occupait de 2011 jusqu'au 26 juillet, le jour du coup d'État.
Conscient du contexte propice au changement, Tchiani réussit à rallier l'armée à sa cause et à obtenir le soutien d’une partie de la population de Niamey, opposée à la gestion clanique du PNDS. C'est ainsi que le Niger a tourné le dos à ses alliés occidentaux, pour se rapprocher des régimes de Bamako et de Ouagadougou.
Soutien de la jeunesse
Le succès de ce putsch est dû à la détermination du général Tchiani. Dès le premier jour du putsch, certains observateurs avaient cru qu'il allait renoncer à sa tentative grâce à la médiation de son chef, Mahamadou Issoufou. Mais ce dernier, n'a pas réussi à faire reculer Tchiani. Finalement, un compromis fut trouvé entre les différents corps de l'armée pour éviter tout affrontement.
La détermination du général Tchiani, à la tête du Conseil national pour la sauvegarde de la patrie (CNSP), lui a permis non seulement de rallier l'armée à sa cause, mais aussi de faire échouer toute tentative de médiation. Le bras de fer qui a débuté le premier jour entre le CNSP et la France – en raison de la reconnaissance de Bazoum comme seul président légitime par Paris – a largement contribué à susciter le soutien de la jeunesse, qui s'est mobilisée pour soutenir le CNSP et exiger le retrait des forces françaises stationnées dans le pays, pour protester contre les sanctions de la Communauté économique des Etats de l'Afrique de l'ouest (Cedeao). Les agissements de la France et de la Cedeao ont donc poussé en quelque sorte le général Tchiani à envisager une rupture avec les Occidentaux.
S’inspirer du cas malien
Tchiani semble déterminé à rester au pouvoir, eu égard aux échecs de la diplomatie. La junte de Niamey semble prendre le même chemin que le Mali et le Burkina Faso. Quelques jours après la prise du pouvoir à Niamey, les putschistes regroupés au sein du CNSP ont rapidement dépêché une importante délégation à Bamako et Ouagadougou, avec à leur tête le numéro deux de la junte, l'ancien chef d'état-major général Salifou Mody.
Les déclarations de soutien se poursuivent et les visites de délégations se sont intensifiées entre les trois pays. Tout comme au Mali, la stratégie des militaires à Niamey est de rassembler les Nigériens au tour d'un nationalisme qui permet de galvaniser les foules et en même d'asseoir leur pouvoir politique.
Un débat télévisé sur les actions à entreprendre par les militaires au pouvoir sur la télévision publique du Niger.
L'opinion nigérienne ignore encore le projet politique, économique, culturel et social des militaires. L’approche sécuritaire semble être la rupture avec la France, comme ses deux voisins auparavant. Si la junte continue sur sa lancée actuelle, le Niger connaîtra probablement un scénario à la malienne.
La question de l'intervention militaire de la Cedeao et la présence de militaires français au Niger sont les deux principales ressources politiques que le CNSP mobilise en sa faveur. Dès ses premiers communiqués, le CNSP s'en est pris à la France en dénonçant des “efforts de déstabilisation et de violations des frontières nigériennes”. Le CNSP a aussi dénoncé tous les accords militaires et de défense signés avec la France.
A contrario, les déclarations des autorités françaises rejetant toute option de quitter le territoire nigérien, renforcent le sentiment souverainiste au sein de l'opinion publique locale.
La marge de manœuvre de la Cedeao semble très réduite dans cette nouvelle crise politique. Elle joue peut-être sa dernière carte de crédibilité. Le discours de “rétablissement de la démocratie”, est devenu dans le discours des putschistes, celui d’une “attaque contre le Niger”.
La présence militaire française est de plus en plus contestée en Afrique, comme en témoignent les manifestations devant sa base au Niger. La diplomatie française ne semble pas avoir tiré les leçons de ses échecs précédents. Elle gagnerait beaucoup à se faire plus discrète. Plus elle est visible, plus elle renforce les autorités militaires nigériennes.",Coup d’État au Niger : de la surprise à l'installation au pouvoir,Null
"Cet été aura été propice à l’annonce de deux mauvaises nouvelles pour le Cameroun, de nature à refroidir l’élan que manifesteraient d’éventuels investisseurs pour acheter de la dette du pays.
Fin juillet 2023, Moody’s a rétrogradé de B2 à Caa1, la notation des dettes de long terme libellées en devises étrangères et en franc CFA, ainsi que celles des dettes seniors, c'est-à-dire les obligations et emprunts qui ont une priorité de remboursement plus élevée par rapport à d'autres catégories de dettes de l'Etat non garanties par un collatéral (généralement des dettes bancaires).
Début août 2023, Standard and Poor’s a abaissé de B- à CCC+ la note des dettes de long terme libellées en devises étrangères, en y ajoutant les dettes de court terme.
Ce que cela signifie
Concrètement, cela signifie que du point de vue d’un investisseur qui souhaiterait acheter sur les marchés de capitaux internationaux de la dette émise par l’Etat camerounais, ce type d’investissement doit désormais être vu comme présentant un risque de défaut substantiel. Il figurait déjà dans la catégorie des investissements très spéculatifs comportant un degré élevé de risque et d'incertitude.
Ces révisions sont-elles arbitraires ? Doit-on considérer, comme le suggérait le président sénégalais Macky Sall en 2022, que les agences internationales de notation exagèrent le risque financier des pays africains ?
Ayant étudié les marchés financiers, la dette extérieure et l'intégration financière des pays africains au reste du monde, mon point de vue est que les agences de notation se fondent généralement sur la situation – et surtout sur les perspectives - budgétaire des pays, ainsi que sur les facteurs susceptibles de créer un risque pour leur situation macroéconomique, financière et sociale.
Dans le cas du Cameroun, l’opinion publique et la presse ont mis en avant l’une des causes de cette dégradation, à savoir l’accumulation d’arriérés de paiement. En effet, en plus d’un retard de paiement - de plus de 5 jours - du service d’une dette bancaire (remboursement des intérêts et d’une partie du principal dus à une filiale espagnole de la Deutsche Bank au cours de l’année 2022), le gouvernement n’a apuré qu’une partie de ses arriérés sur ses dettes non-commerciales.
Ces dettes non-commerciales sont celles qui n'ont pas été contractées auprès du système bancaire (ce qu'a souligné, au mois de juin, l’équipe du Fonds monétaire international (FMI) qui a effectué les quatrièmes revues d’un programme d’aide financière dont le Cameroun bénéficie actuellement au titre de la facilité élargie de crédit et du mécanisme élargi de crédit.
Conséquences de la révision des notes
La décision des agences de notation doit être appréciée dans un contexte particulier. Pour commencer, l’aide dont bénéficie actuellement le Cameroun de la part du FMI est ciblée pour des pays dont l’économie présente de graves problèmes macroéconomiques structurels susceptibles de conduire à des crises de balance de paiement. Par exemple, les problèmes de gouvernance (perception de la corruption) freinent les entrées de capitaux sous la forme d’investissements directs étrangers et de portefeuille.
Les progrès dans l’achèvement des projets de réhabilitation des infrastructures dans les secteurs du transport et de l’énergie ne sont pas suffisamment rapides pour hausser le niveau de la productivité globale des facteurs. Par ailleurs, le pays peine à réduire son taux de pauvreté qui culmine autour de 40 % et qui s’accompagne de grandes disparités régionales, mais aussi entre zones rurales et zones urbaines.
Au-delà des chiffres encourageants sur les perspectives de croissance, les équilibres budgétaires et les réformes menées par l’administration fiscale, la question importante porte sur la capacité de résilience de la situation macro-budgétaire - qui reste fragile – face à la multiplication des chocs. Ce sont des facteurs de risques : crise du Covid-19, guerre d’Ukraine, crise politique et insécurité dans les régions anglophones, tensions inflationnistes, remontée des taux d’intérêt mondiaux, crise migratoire, etc.
Or, l’orientation actuelle de tous ces facteurs joue en défaveur du Cameroun. Ce qui explique que la moindre décision de reporter le règlement d’une échéance sur une dette soit lue comme un signe avant-coureur d’un possible défaut (même si, in fine, ce dernier ne se produit pas). Les agences de notation s’intéressent au fait de savoir si ces facteurs sont susceptibles de peser négativement sur les indicateurs macroéconomiques, budgétaires et financiers du Cameroun.
Un signal envoyé par les marchés
La réponse est, sans doute, positive. Tout d’abord, les chances que les dépenses publiques évoluent en-deçà des limites prévues dans son programme d’ajustement conclu avec le FMI sont jugées faibles au regard de plusieurs facteurs :
probables hausses des subventions aux ménages et aux entreprises dont le niveau de pauvreté s’est accru en raison de l’inflation;
hausse des dépenses liées aux migrations provoquées par la crise sociopolitique avec les Etats anglophones du Nord, et par la volatilité des prix du pétrole qui risque de renchérir les importations de pétrole raffiné;
hausse des taux d’intérêt mondiaux qui risque également de durcir les conditions de refinancement sur les marchés de capitaux mondiaux, en affectant donc directement le service de la dette.
Par ailleurs, les réformes visant à améliorer des ressources budgétaires et le potentiel de croissance sont en cours et n’ont pas encore révélé leur pleine potentialité. La dernière revue du FMI en juin 2023 souligne que les réformes structurelles progressent à un rythme lent. Ce dernier élément est susceptible de peser sur l’amélioration du climat des affaires. Il peut obérer les capacités du Cameroun à recevoir des investissements directs étrangers qui seraient nécessaires au financement de l’activité des secteurs non pétroliers.
Le Cameroun peut être classé parmi les pays dont la balance des paiements et les soldes budgétaires font apparaître des besoins de financement élevés. Au point que le pays est appuyé par un programme du FMI pour lui éviter une crise de liquidités. Dans ce contexte, une règle d’or est que les arriérés de paiement ne peuvent servir, même temporairement, à financer les dépenses. La décision de Moody’s et de Standard and Poor’s était donc attendue.
Les conséquences à court terme de la dégradation de la note souveraine sont imprévisibles. Mais on peut interpréter cette dégradation comme un signal envoyé par les marchés au gouvernement, au moment où ce dernier bénéficie d’un appui financier du FMI et doit engager des réformes structurelles pour accroître la productivité de son économie et dégager des ressources permettant de réduire la pauvreté.",Dégradation de la notation souveraine du Cameroun : quelles causes et quelles conséquences ?,Null
"Plus de 2 000 personnes sont mortes lorsqu'un puissant tremblement de terre de magnitude 6,8 a frappé le Maroc le 8 septembre. L'épicentre se trouvait dans les montagnes du Haut Atlas, à 71 km au sud-ouest de Marrakech. Moina Spooner, de The Conversation Africa, a demandé à José A. Peláez, professeur de géophysique qui a mené des recherches sur l'activité sismique au Maroc, ce qui a conduit à cette situation.
Quels sont les facteurs géologiques qui ont contribué à ce tremblement de terre ?
La surface de la Terre est constituée de plusieurs plaques tectoniques, de grands segments de la couche externe de la planète, qui se déplacent les uns par rapport aux autres. Ce mouvement est à l'origine de divers phénomènes géologiques, tels que les tremblements de terre, les volcans, la formation des montagnes et des bassins océaniques.
L'activité tectonique au Maroc est principalement liée à la convergence des plaques eurasienne et nubienne (africaine). La plaque eurasienne poussant contre la plaque nubienne est à l'origine de la formation des montagnes de l'Atlas, qui traversent le Maroc, l'Algérie et la Tunisie. C'est dans ces montagnes que se trouve l’épicentre du récent tremblement de terre.
Shutterstock
Actuellement, les collisions entre les plaques provoquent un raccourcissement des montagnes de l'Atlas, ce qui explique la sismicité de la région. Nous le savons grâce aux données des mesures GPS, qui montrent qu'elles se rapprochent d'environ 1 millimètre l'une de l'autre chaque année.
Ce raccourcissement et cette compression provoquent ce que l'on appelle des failles, ce sont d'énormes frictions entre les plaques. Ces failles sont la cause probable de ce tremblement de terre. Les scientifiques pensent que ces failles sont actives depuis longtemps, depuis quelques millions d'années.
En outre, comme l'ont souligné plusieurs chercheurs, les montagnes du Haut Atlas présentent une caractéristique géologique unique : la couche externe et dure de la Terre, appelée lithosphère, est plus mince que d'habitude, ce qui s'accompagne d'une élévation inhabituelle du manteau. Toutes ces caractéristiques pourraient avoir influencé la survenue de ce tremblement de terre de forte magnitude.
Quelle est l'histoire des tremblements de terre au Maroc ?
L'activité sismique et ses phénomènes, comme les tremblements de terre, ne sont pas inhabituels au Maroc.
Au cours des mille dernières années, les tremblements de terre qui ont affecté le Maroc ont eu tendance à se produire principalement dans deux zones. Une zone offshore, le long de la faille transformante Açores-Gibraltar et de la mer d'Alboran, et une zone terrestre, le long des montagnes du Rif dans le nord du Maroc et de la chaîne de montagnes du Tell Atlas dans le nord-ouest de l'Algérie. Les tremblements de terre le long de la ceinture de l'Atlas sont moins nombreux, mais ne sont pas inhabituels.
Les montagnes de l'Atlas. Wikipedia
Les tremblements de terre les plus importants et les plus récents qui ont affecté le Maroc ont eu lieu en en 1994, 2004 et 2016, avec des magnitudes comprises entre 6,0 et 6,3. Ils se sont produits dans la région la plus active du Maroc sur le plan sismique, ainsi que dans la région de la Méditerranée occidentale.
Un peu plus loin dans l'histoire, il y a eu le tremblement de terre dévastateur d'Agadir en février 1960, d'une magnitude de 6,3. Il était situé à la limite entre le Haut Atlas occidental et l'Anti Atlas, au sud. Les données disponibles indiquent qu'entre 12 000 et 15 000 personnes sont mortes à cause de cet événement. En outre, près de l'endroit où s'est produit le récent séisme, il y a eu un autre tremblement de terre en 1955, d'une magnitude estimée à environ 5,8.
Encore plus loin dans le temps, avant la mise en place des sismomètres, plusieurs événements importants ont été enregistrés au Maroc. Parmi eux, le tremblement de terre de Fès en 1624, d'une magnitude estimée à 6,7, et le tremblement de terre d'Agadir en 1731, d'une magnitude de 6,4.
Pouvait-on le prévoir ?
Les tremblements de terre ne peuvent pas être prédits, même avec les connaissances actuelles en sismologie. De nombreux chercheurs pensent d'ailleurs qu'il ne sera plus possible de le faire à l'avenir. Ce que les sismologues peuvent faire, c'est déterminer les zones dans lesquelles les tremblements de terre sont les plus susceptibles de se produire, voire établir la probabilité de leur survenue et leur incertitude.
C'est ce qu'on appelle une prévision à long terme, réalisée à partir d'études spécifiques sur les risques sismiques dans la région. Elles sont basées sur la connaissance de la sismicité passée de la région, tant historique qu'instrumentale, et sur l'existence et la connaissance de structures tectoniques actives (failles) susceptibles de générer des tremblements de terre. Plus on en sait sur ces deux sujets - la sismicité et les failles actives dans la région -, plus on en saura sur la sismicité future de la région et moins l'incertitude sera grande.
Les études sur les risques sismiques comprennent également l'étude des conditions du sol à proximité de la surface et des caractéristiques des bâtiments. Cela permet d'évaluer les dommages éventuels causés par ces tremblements de terre potentiels.
Que peut-on faire pour réduire l'impact des futurs tremblements de terre au Maroc ?
Le meilleur outil dont nous disposons pour atténuer l'impact des tremblements de terre est de mener des études fiables sur les risques sismiques. Les résultats de ces études doivent ensuite être intégrés dans les codes de construction nationaux. De cette manière, les ingénieurs peuvent intégrer la sécurité sismique dans la conception des bâtiments.
Les codes de construction doivent prendre en compte plusieurs facteurs, notamment les caractéristiques du sol, la façon dont les ondes sismiques se déplacent et la manière dont le sol peut amplifier son mouvement lors d'un tremblement de terre. Il faut également tenir compte des secousses attendues du sol, qui influencent le comportement des bâtiments et les dommages qu'ils subissent. Ces facteurs varient d'une ville à l'autre et, dans certains cas, d'un quartier à l'autre.
Les sismologues savent que les tremblements de terre ne tuent pas les gens, mais les bâtiments. Les bâtiments dépourvus de réglementation et de soutien structurel sont des tueurs potentiels dans les zones à haut risque sismique. Au fur et à mesure que l'on en apprend davantage sur la géologie des tremblements de terre et sur leur impact sur les bâtiments, les codes de construction doivent être mis à jour régulièrement. C'est le meilleur moyen de se protéger contre ces phénomènes catastrophiques. Les responsables de l'aménagement du territoire doivent le savoir et en tenir compte.",Le séisme au Maroc n'était pas inattendu : les codes de construction doivent s'y adapter,Null
"Un séisme de magnitude 6,8 a frappé le Maroc à 11km d’Adassil le vendredi 8 Septembre 2023 à 23h11 heure locale. On déplore plus de 2 000 décès et autant de blessés avec un bilan qui pourrait encore s'alourdir.
Depuis l’espace, on peut obtenir des informations cruciales pour guider les secours et l’aide humanitaire qui convoie eau et vivres, mais qui sont inaccessibles depuis le sol, en particulier en cas de catastrophes. Il s’agit de cartographier l’état des routes, des ponts, des bâtiments, et aussi – et c’est crucial ici – de repérer les populations qui tentent d’échapper aux effets de potentielles répliques en se regroupant dans des stades ou d’autres espaces ouverts.
Afin de tourner rapidement les yeux des satellites vers les régions concernées, les Nations Unies (UNITAR) ont demandé l’activation de la charte internationale « Espace et Catastrophes majeures » le samedi matin à 7h04 heure locale pour le compte de l’organisation humanitaire internationale FICR (Fédération internationale des Sociétés de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge).
Dans la foulée, les satellites optiques et radar les plus appropriés de huit agences spatiales ont été programmés. Pour la France, il s’agit des satellites optiques Pléiades et Pléiades Neo (de haute et très haute résolution), qui fourniront de premières images dès demain matin, lors de leur passage au-dessus de la zone, le temps de charger le plan de vol. Des satellites radar viendront compléter les informations des satellites optiques, car ils fonctionnent aussi la nuit et à travers les nuages, et peuvent imager les glissements de terrain et les changements d’altitude, même très faibles.

Chaque année, des millions de personnes partout dans le monde sont touchées par des catastrophes, qu’elles soient d’origine naturelle (cyclone, tornade, typhon, tremblement de terre, glissement de terrain, éruption volcanique, tsunami, inondation, feu de forêt, etc.) ou humaine (pollution par hydrocarbures, explosion industrielle). L’intensité et la fréquence de ces évènements s’intensifient malheureusement avec le changement climatique, créant chaque jour un peu plus de sinistrés ou d’habitats précaires.
Anatomie d’une catastrophe
Dans le cadre de la charte internationale « Espace et catastrophes majeures », on définit une catastrophe comme un événement de grande ampleur, soudain, unique et incontrôlé, entraînant la perte de vies humaines ou des dommages aux biens et à l’environnement et nécessitant une action urgente d’acquisition et de fourniture de données.

Cette charte a été créée par le Centre National d’Études Spatiales et l’Agence spatiale européenne en 1999, rejoints rapidement par l’Agence spatiale canadienne. Aujourd’hui, 17 agences spatiales membres s’unissent pour offrir gratuitement des images satellites le plus rapidement possible sur la zone sinistrée. Depuis 2000, la charte a été activée 837 fois dans plus de 134 pays. Elle est depuis complétée par des initiatives similaires (Copernicus Emergency ou Sentinel Asia).

Près des trois-quarts des activations de la charte sont dues à des phénomènes hydrométéorologiques : tempêtes, ouragans et surtout inondations qui représentent à elles seules la moitié des activations. Dans ces situations de crise imprévues, quand les sols sont endommagés ou inondés et les routes impraticables, les moyens terrestres ne permettent pas toujours d’analyser l’étendue du désastre et d’organiser au mieux les secours et l’aide humanitaire. En capturant la situation vue de l’espace, avec des satellites très haute résolution, le spatial apporte rapidement des informations cruciales.

Dans certains cas, la charte ne peut pas être activée. Soit parce que l’objet est hors cadre de la charte (guerres et conflits armés), soit parce que l’imagerie spatiale n’est parfois pas d’un grand intérêt (canicules, épidémies), soit car les phénomènes ont une évolution lente (sècheresses) qui est incompatible avec la notion d’urgence au cœur de la mission de la charte.
Les données satellites en réponse aux crises dans le monde
Dès la survenue d’une catastrophe, les satellites sont programmés pour acquérir dans un délai très court des images au-dessus des zones impactées. Plus d’une soixantaine de satellites, optiques ou radars, sont mobilisables à toute heure.
Read more: « Sismo-citoyens » et chercheurs du monde entier s’allient pour comprendre le récent séisme d’Haïti
Selon le type de catastrophes, on mobilisera différents satellites, en se basant sur des scénarii de crise préétablis – parmi eux : TerraSAR-X/Tandem-X, QuickBird-2, Radarsat, Landsat-7/8, SPOT, Pléiades, Sentinel-2 notamment.

Les images optiques sont semblables à des photos vues de l’espace, mais les images radar par exemple sont plus difficilement interprétables par les non-initiés. Ainsi, suite à la catastrophe, les informations satellites sont retravaillées pour les rendre intelligibles et y apporter de la valeur ajoutée. Elles sont par exemple transformées en cartes d’impacts ou de changements pour les secouristes, en cartes de vigilance inondations pour les populations, en cartographie des zones brûlées ou inondées avec estimation des dégâts pour les décideurs.

Le travail collaboratif entre les utilisateurs de terrain et les opérateurs satellitaires est primordial. Des progrès ont été faits grâce aux innovations des technologies d’observation de la Terre (notamment la performance des résolutions optiques – passant de 50 à 20 mètres puis à 30 centimètres actuellement) et des logiciels de traitement des données 3D, mais également grâce au développement d’outils numériques pouvant coupler données satellites et in situ. De plus, les besoins de terrain ont contribué à l’évolution des processus d’intervention de la charte en termes de délai de livraison et de qualité des produits délivrés.
La reconstruction après les catastrophes
La gestion de l’urgence est bien sûr primordiale mais il est important pour tous les pays affectés d’envisager une reconstruction et l’avenir. En effet, dans le « cycle du risque », après le sinistre et l’urgence humanitaire, le retour à la normale va ouvrir le temps de la reconstruction, de la résilience, de la prévention et de l’alerte. On ne peut prévoir les catastrophes mais on peut mieux s’y préparer, surtout dans les pays où le malheur est récurrent, avec par exemple la construction antisismique, le déplacement des zones d’habitation en lieu sûr, la sensibilisation aux gestes de survie, la création de lieux de rassemblements sécurisés, entre autres.

Plusieurs initiatives, appelées « Observatoires de la Reconstruction », ont été menées après des catastrophes d’envergure, par exemple à Haïti en 2021, ou suite à l’explosion de Beyrouth en 2019. Le but : planifier des acquisitions d’images satellites coordonnées pour permettre une évaluation détaillée et dynamique des dommages aux zones les plus touchées (bâti, routes, agriculture, forêts, etc.), suivre la planification des reconstructions, réduire les risques et enfin réaliser un suivi des changements à l’horizon de 3-4 ans.",Séisme au Maroc : les satellites peuvent aider les secours à réagir au plus vite,home page
"La récente intervention militaire qui a mis fin à la mainmise de la famille Bongo sur le pouvoir au Gabon, qui durait depuis 56 ans, a été préparée de longue date.
Ses origines remontent au moment où le président déchu Ali Bongo Ondimba a été victime d'un accident vasculaire cérébral en 2018.
La crise politique provoquée par la maladie de M. Bongo et la manière opaque dont il a continué à tenir les rênes du pouvoir par l'intermédiaire de membres de sa famille proche pendant sa convalescence ont créé des tensions au sein des cercles du pouvoir.
D'un côté, il y avait les critiques qui exigeaient sa démission et cherchaient à mettre fin à la mainmise de la dynastie Bongo sur le pouvoir dans ce pays d'Afrique centrale riche en pétrole. Ces critiques sont en grande partie responsables de l'émergence d’Albert Ondo Ossa en tant que candidat consensuel de l'opposition à l'élection présidentielle de 2023.
De l'autre côté, on trouve les membres fidèles du Parti démocratique gabonais, le parti au pouvoir. Ce parti a été fondé par l'ancien président Omar Bongo, qui a dirigé le pays de 1967 à 2009. Dans ce groupe se trouvaient des membres du parti qui ont continué à jouer une mascarade institutionnelle faite de réunions de membres du gouvernement et des lois approuvées aveuglément qui masquaient l'absence troublante et l'incapacité d'Ali Bongo.
Le groupe comprend également des membres puissants du clan au sein de la dynastie Bongo qui se disputent des positions et des richesses dans un contexte d'incertitude sur la santé d'Ali Bongo.
En tant que politologue spécialisé dans la politique africaine et la politique de l'industrie pétrolière en Afrique, j'ai fait des recherches sur les implications de la dépendance à la rente pétrolière et du néocolonialisme au Gabon.
Je pense que le régime dynastique corrompu de la rente pétrolière qui a gouverné le Gabon au cours du dernier demi-siècle a pris fin en raison de la combinaison de trois facteurs. Il s'agit de la maladie d'Ali Bongo, de l'effet de contagion d'autres coups d'État réussis récemment en Afrique et de la lutte pour le pouvoir entre le général Brice Oligui Nguema (le chef du coup d'État, qui serait le cousin éloigné d'Ali Bongo) et Sylvia Bongo Ondimba, l'épouse d'Ali Bongo. L'ancienne première dame préparerait son fils, Noureddine Bongo, à succéder à son père.
Facteurs en faveur du coup d'État
Avant le coup d'État, il y avait peu d'espoir qu'Ali Bongo Ondimba perde sa troisième tentative de réélection.
Son parti détenait plus de 80 % des sièges au parlement, contrôlait les conseils régionaux et municipaux et avait la mainmise sur les tribunaux et l'appareil de sécurité de l'État.
Ali Bongo aurait remporté 64,27 % des suffrages exprimés lors de l'élection, que l'opposition a qualifiée de simulacre. Selon l'organe en charge des élections, le principal adversaire d'Ali Bongo, Albert Ondo Ossa, est arrivé en deuxième position avec 30,77 %. C'était avant que les militaires n'interviennent.
L'un des facteurs qui a encouragé l'intervention militaire au Gabon est l'effet de contagion des récents coups d'État réussis en Afrique. Une série de coups d'État au Mali (2020), au Tchad (2021), en Guinée (2021), au Burkina Faso (2022) et au Niger (2022) semble avoir démontré aux militaires gabonais qu'un coup d'État réussi était non seulement possible, mais aussi acceptable.
Après le coup d'État, des foules sont sorties à Libreville et ont dansé dans les rues.
Le deuxième facteur est une lutte pour le pouvoir entre le chef du coup d'État, Nguema, et Sylvia Bongo. L'épouse du président déchu aurait gagné en influence après l'accident vasculaire cérébral dont son mari a été victime en 2018. Nguema a été relevé de ses fonctions de chef de la sécurité du président.
S'il est vrai que Sylvia préparait son fils à succéder à son père, Noureddine aurait été la troisième génération de la famille Bongo à diriger le Gabon. Ali Bongo a succédé à son père en 2009.
La voie à suivre
Avant le coup d'État du 30 août, la seule chose qui semblait unir les nombreux partis d'opposition du Gabon (qui ont à peine réussi à se rassembler autour d'un candidat commun neuf jours avant le scrutin du 26 août) était le désir de démettre Ali Bongo de ses fonctions.
Maintenant qu'un coup d'État semble y être parvenu, il sera difficile pour Albert Ondo Ossa de prendre ses fonctions.
Etant donné ce qui semble être la volonté de la France et des Etats-Unis d'accepter cette révolution de palais, la seule question est de savoir si Nguema mènera une transition vers un régime civil, organisera des élections, refusera de se présenter, ou deviendra le prochain membre du clan Bongo à gouverner.",Le coup d'État au Gabon a été préparé pendant des années : 3 facteurs clés qui ont mis fin à la dynastie Bongo,Null
"L'Afrique occidentale française a connu cinq coups d'État au cours des trois dernières années. La plupart de ces coups d'État reposent sur une hostilité à l'égard de la France, ancienne autorité coloniale. La chute de Mohamed Bazoum du Niger en juillet 2023 intervient après les coups d'État du Mali en août 2020, du Tchad en avril 2021, du Burkina Faso en septembre 2022 et du Gabon en septembre 2023.
Les auteurs de ces coups d'État ont évoqué parmi leurs justifications l'influence prépondérante de la France et de son président, Emmanuel Macron, dans leurs affaires. L'influence de la France dans les affaires militaires et le maintien de sa position dominante dans le monde des affaires ont été des éléments clés de l'agenda de Macron. Contrairement à d'autres anciennes puissances coloniales, la France possède toujours des bases militaires en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Gabon.
Dans le même temps, M. Macron a mis en avant l'esprit d'entreprise comme la meilleure forme d'aide au développement. Ce pivot stratégique qui s'éloigne des relations personnelles avec les dirigeants africains est ancré dans les convictions néolibérales de M. Macron. Il s'agit d'une approche politique qui favorise le capitalisme de marché, la déréglementation et la réduction des dépenses publiques.
Je suis un historien qui a fait des recherches sur les relations entre la France et ses anciennes colonies.
En Afrique, le virage néolibéral de Macron a dépouillé la France du mythe de longue date selon lequel elle était en quelque sorte un colonisateur plus bienveillant en raison des liens culturels qu'elle a établis avec les élites africaines. L'approche de Macron n'a fait qu'accroître la méfiance et la colère, car une présence militaire importante n'a pas été remplacée par un nouvel ordre économique international, mais par des accords commerciaux pour les petites entreprises et des start-ups. Ce n'est pas ce que les Africains voulaient, mais c'est ce qu'ils ont obtenu.
Les valeurs néolibérales sont des valeurs françaises
Plutôt que de refaire l'infrastructure économique et financière, Macron a fait de l'entrepreneuriat une aide au développement : il a encouragé la création d'entreprises et la formation des jeunes Africains. L’Agence française de développement (la principale institution française chargée de la mise en oeuvre des politiques) continue d'investir dans l'éducation, l'agriculture et les infrastructures. Mais ce que Macron veut que les observateurs remarquent, c'est que, de plus en plus, l'aide française au développement en Afrique doit être gérée par des entreprises françaises.
Les entreprises françaises ne gagnent plus d'argent en secret, comme à l'époque de la Françafrique. À cette époque, les présidents français soutenaient les dictateurs africains pour conserver leur influence. Les discours de Macron mettent plutôt en avant les activités commerciales et les valeurs néolibérales comme des valeurs françaises bénéfiques pour le continent.
Ce recours à la culture et aux valeurs françaises peut être considéré comme la poursuite d'une stratégie qui a débuté avec le projet colonial français. Les valeurs de Macron, cependant, sont celles du néolibéralisme. Sur le plan intérieur, il a fait adopter un plan de retraite visant à limiter la dette de l'État français. À l'étranger, il souhaite que la politique française de développement soit menée par des initiatives privées.
À la lumière de cette stratégie, il apparaît clairement que les sentiments des Africains ne sont pas devenus plus anti-français. Au contraire, en élevant l'économie au rang de valeur centrale de sa relation avec l'Afrique, Macron a joué avec une vision du monde africaine largement acceptée, selon laquelle le sous-développement est le produit de la dépendance à l'égard de l'Europe et de l'exploitation néocoloniale.
Tous les visiteurs qui discutent avec les chauffeurs de taxi ou les vendeurs à Dakar comprennent rapidement que les Français sont perçus comme des colonisateurs d'abord, et puis éventuellement comme des amis. Ce qui a changé, c'est que Macron a confirmé involontairement les soupçons des Africains quant à ses intentions : il n'a jamais voulu changer les structures économiques. Au lieu de cela, les Africains reçoivent des miettes sous forme d'argent pour les start-up.
Le marché libre comme ligne de démarcation en Afrique de l'Ouest
L'esprit d'entreprise ne fait pas l'unanimité sur le continent. La croyance dans l'économie de marché comme moteur de développement a redessiné les lignes de bataille en Afrique de l'Ouest. Les pays de la Cedeao, comme le Ghana, le Nigeria et le Sénégal, qui ont connu une forte croissance économique au cours de la dernière décennie, jurent d'avec le Niger, le Mali et le Burkina Faso, qui ont connu une aggravation de la pauvreté.
Alors que d'autres pays africains comme le Kenya sont confrontés à des débats similaires sur la manière de stimuler le développement - le président kenyan croit en sa fameuse “ nation des débrouillards""ou ”hustler nation“ - le changement climatique et le terrorisme ont conduit à un cocktail plus explosif dans le Sahel.
Les juntes qui sont arrivées au pouvoir ne se présentent donc pas seulement comme des intérimaires. Elles prétendent également vouloir donner une nouvelle orientation idéologique à leur pays. Ibrahim Traoré au Burkina Faso s'est présenté comme le successeur de Thomas Sankara, Assimi Goïta s'est présenté comme un réformateur et non comme un révolutionnaire.
Dans le passé, les feux de l'instabilité africaine et du sentiment anti-français ont été attisés par le non-respect par les Français de leurs promesses - parfois cyniques - de grands changements structurels. Aujourd'hui, c'est l'inverse qui alimente l'instabilité. Ce sont les dirigeants africains qui réclament de grands changements structurels, mais ils se heurtent aux efforts des petites entreprises pour maintenir l'influence française à moindre coût.",La France en Afrique : pourquoi les politiques de Macron ont accru la méfiance et la colère,Null
"La République centrafricaine (RCA) est l'un des pays les plus pauvres du monde. En 2022, son PIB par habitant était estimé à 491 USD par an.
Cette nation d'environ 5 millions d'habitants est en proie à des troubles politiques depuis une prise de pouvoir violente en 2013. Un “effondrement total de l'ordre public” persiste depuis près de 20 ans. Près de la moitié des campagnes échappe au contrôle du gouvernement.
Pour tenter de reprendre le contrôle, le gouvernement a lancé en 2020 une campagne menée par les mercenaires russes du groupe Wagner. Un rapport documentant les violations généralisées des droits de l'homme en RCA par le groupe Wagner décrit “des campagnes bien planifiées de massacres, de tortures et de viols”. Ce qui reflète généralement le contenu des communiqués de presse et des discours émanant du Haut Commissariat des Nations unies aux droits de l'homme.
En conséquence, la RCA connaît aujourd'hui une crise humanitaire aiguë.
L'un des symptômes de cet effondrement est le taux de mortalité élevé du pays. Deux études publiées au cours des deux dernières années ont suggéré que de vastes régions du pays connaissaient un taux de mortalité qui dépasse les seuils d'alerte. L'une était une enquête réalisée par Médecins sans Frontières en 2020 dans la préfecture de Ouaka. L’autre couvrait la majeure partie de la préfecture de Ouham-Pende et a été réalisée avec l'International Rescue Committee en 2018. Les études ont révélé que 4,9 % et 5,0 % des populations étudiées mouraient chaque année.
Ces estimations sont quatre fois plus élevées que l'estimation de mortalité de l'ONU de 1,1 % par an pour 2020 pour la RCA. La plupart des agences, telles que les Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, considèrent le doublement de la mortalité de base comme une crise, et le quadruplement de la mortalité de base est l'un des trois critères utilisés pour définir une famine.
En raison de la discordance entre les mesures récentes de la mortalité et le taux de mortalité officiel, nous avons, en tant que chercheurs en santé publique ayant une expérience de recherche dans les situations de conflit, mené une enquête pour mesurer le taux de mortalité brut de la nation - la fraction de la population qui meurt par unité de temps sans tenir compte du fait qu'il s'agit d'une population jeune ou âgée.
Notre étude a révélé que 5,6 % de la population mourrait en 2022. Il s'agit d'un taux de mortalité stupéfiant, compte tenu de l'ampleur de la souffrance et de l'erreur des statistiques officielles. La plupart de ces décès sont dus au paludisme et à la diarrhée. Nous avons également constaté que la mortalité était nettement plus élevée dans les zones échappant au contrôle du gouvernement.
Les conditions désastreuses dans lesquelles vivent les habitants de la République centrafricaine n'ont suscité que très peu d'intérêt ou de réponse humanitaire de la part du reste du monde. Pourtant, comme le montrent les chiffres de la mortalité, l'aide alimentaire, les programmes de travail et la distribution de semences et d'outils font cruellement défaut.
Ces besoins sont particulièrement importants dans les zones rurales qui échappent au contrôle du gouvernement. Bien que certains acteurs humanitaires fassent de leur mieux pour répondre à la situation, le taux de mortalité au niveau de la crise suggère que les besoins en RCA sont largement insatisfaits.
Mortalité
Nous avons mené une enquête dans deux régions. L'une dans la partie du pays contrôlée par le gouvernement (environ la moitié du pays), et l'autre dans les zones qui échappent en grande partie à son contrôle. Nous avons sélectionné au hasard 40 groupes de 10 ménages chacun.
Nous avons constaté que le taux de natalité était plus faible et le taux de mortalité nettement plus élevé dans les zones échappant au contrôle du gouvernement. Les familles ont décrit le paludisme, la fièvre et la diarrhée comme les principales causes de décès. La violence représentait 6 % de l'ensemble des décès.
Les gens ont cité l'accès à la nourriture et l'accès aux soins médicaux comme étant leurs plus grands défis. Les ménages ont déclaré avoir pris environ deux fois moins de repas en 2022 qu'en 2020. Seuls 15 % d'entre eux avaient bénéficié des distributions d'aide alimentaire en 2022, malgré les niveaux élevés de malnutrition enregistrés dans le pays.
Ces deux défis interagissent l'un avec l'autre. Les enfants et les autres personnes vulnérables, comme les personnes âgées, qui survivraient normalement à un épisode de paludisme ou de diarrhée, ont besoin de soins médicaux appropriés pour survivre en cas de malnutrition. Or, en raison de la détresse économique et de la violence, la fréquentation des cliniques rurales est généralement en baisse par rapport aux années précédentes.
Le coût des soins de santé est un autre facteur. Certaines ONG fournissent des soins gratuits, mais la plupart de celles qui ont été visitées par notre équipe de recherche demandent une modeste participation aux frais. Bien qu'ils ne soient pas standardisés, ils demandent généralement un montant équivalant à une fourchette d'un demi dollar à un dollar américain, et facturent parfois les médicaments séparément. Les coûts non liés à la clinique, tels que le transport, peuvent être encore plus élevés.
Il s'y ajoute un autre coût : les paiements informels qu'on est obligés d'effectuer lorsqu'on tente de se rendre dans des établissements de soins de santé. De nombreuses personnes ont indiqué que la police ou les soldats rebelles leur demandaient de l'argent pour passer les points de contrôle. Dans la préfecture de Ouaka, où l'organisation caritative Médecins Sans Frontières fournit des services médicaux sans frais d'utilisation. Une personne interrogée nous a raconté que sa fille avait récemment accouché à la maison plutôt que d'aller à l'hôpital, parce que les policiers aux postes de contrôle savaient qu'une femme enceinte serait désespérée et qu'ils lui demanderaient plus que les 500 francs (environ 0,8 USD) habituels pour la faire passer.
Quelles perspectives?
Des taux de mortalité nationaux plus élevés ont été enregistrés en Afrique par le passé. Les estimations suggèrent qu'au moins 500 000 des 7 millions de Rwandais sont morts violemment en 1994. Au cours de la guerre sécessionniste du Nigeria au Biafra de 1967 à 1970, on estime qu'entre 1 et 3 millions de personnes sont mortes. Ces événements ont déclenché une forte accélération de la riposte en matière d'aide humanitaire, de l'aide financière et de l'attention politique.
Notre étude n'a pas pu déterminer l'importance relative des décennies de conflit en cours, de l'extrême pauvreté, des perturbations économiques depuis 2020 ou des efforts de perturbation généralisés du groupe Wagner dans la cause de l'extrême mortalité observée en République centrafricaine.
Néanmoins, il est clair qu'ils contribuent tous au taux de mortalité. Nous n'avons trouvé aucun exemple depuis 1994 d'une nation entière mourant à un taux aussi élevé que celui que nous avons mesuré en RCA en 2022.
Les acteurs humanitaires tirent la sonnette d'alarme depuis plus de dix ans. L'ONU met en garde contre l'insécurité alimentaire extrême depuis deux ans. À la décharge de certaines agences, les ménages font état de distributions de nourriture dans certaines des zones les plus critiques.
Nos conclusions montrent qu'en dépit de ces efforts, l'aide est largement insuffisante. Etant donné que le gouvernement américain a donné à lui seul plus de 330 millions de dollars d'aide à la RCA en 2021 et 2022, on peut se demander si la communauté humanitaire peut faire mieux. En particulier, la communauté humanitaire ignore-t-elle l'une des pires crises humanitaires au monde ?","Wagner, les conflits et la pauvreté font que le taux de mortalité en République centrafricaine dépasse les niveaux de la crise : mais où est l'aide ?",Null
"Depuis quelques années, le terme « émergence » est employé pour définir ce qui serait la nouvelle trajectoire de l’Afrique subsaharienne. Ce terme a remplacé le mot « développement » qui fait aujourd’hui complètement « has been ». Au XXe siècle, l’Afrique subsaharienne était censée se développer ; au XXIe siècle elle est censée émerger. Ainsi, sur 54 pays africains, 37 ont lancé un plan visant à devenir un « émergent » à moyen terme.
L’émergence signifie que des mutations socio-économiques profondes sont à l’œuvre. L’urbanisation est rapide et change les modes de vie. Une classe moyenne fait son apparition. Les perspectives de croissance des économies africaines – qui sont qualifiées de « lions » ou d’« éléphants » en fonction des rapports – sont prometteuses et pérennes. Les entrepreneurs africains innovent et créent de nouveaux biens et des services grâce aux technologies numériques qui connectent les Africains à d’autres mondes. Les femmes africaines luttent pour améliorer leur statut dans la société.
Mais le nouveau concept d’émergence résume-t-il vraiment la trajectoire de l’Afrique depuis le début du XXIe siècle alors que les bienfaits de la globalisation sont de plus en plus mis en doute, qu’une nouvelle crise de la dette pointe à l’horizon et que des centaines de milliers d’Africains fuient le continent au péril de leur vie ?
Qu’est-ce que l’émergence ?
Depuis plus d’une décennie, ce concept domine le discours sur l’Afrique et une conférence sur l’émergence a lieu chaque année à l’initiative du président de la Côte d’Ivoire, Alassane Ouattara.
L’émergence se caractérise par :
un taux de croissance à deux chiffres ;
la formation d’un marché de consommation et de son corollaire sociologique, une classe moyenne autrefois inconnue ;
un regain d’investissements privés importants qui signale l’attractivité des marchés africains ;
l’accès d’une part grandissante de la population aux nouvelles technologies de la communication.
Entre 2001 et 2010, six des dix pays avec le taux de croissance économique le plus élevé au monde étaient africains : l’Angola (1er), le Nigeria (4e), l’Éthiopie (5e), le Tchad (7e), le Mozambique (8e) et le Rwanda (10e).
Les nouvelles technologies se répandent à un rythme soutenu en Afrique avec un taux de pénétration de l’Internet mobile qui doit passer pendant la période 2016-2020 de 26 % à 38 % de la population. Et dans un rapport qui est devenu célèbre (« Le milieu de la pyramide : les dynamiques de la classe moyenne africaine »), la Banque africaine de développement (BAD) estimait en 2011 qu’environ 370 millions Africains appartenaient à la classe moyenne, soit 34 % de la population du continent. Bref, l’émergence est une façon de dire que l’Afrique se met au diapason des évolutions du XXIe siècle.
L’émergence à la loupe
Comme tout phénomène nouveau, l’émergence a son observatoire.
En 2017, un think tank d’experts africains, l’Observatoire pour l’émergence en Afrique, a rendu public la première édition de son « index de l’émergence en Afrique ». Ce travail fournit une définition de l’émergence et pratique le classement par indicateurs.
L’émergence est définie comme « un processus de transformation économique soutenue qui se traduit par des performances aux plans social et humain, et qui prend place dans un contexte politique et institutionnel stable susceptible d’en assurer la soutenabilité ». L’index de l’émergence est une tentative d’objectiver le processus d’émergence avec des indicateurs empruntés à d’autres outils d’évaluation tels que l’indicateur de développement humain du PNUD et les indicateurs de gouvernance institutionnelle développés par la Banque mondiale.
L’index de l’émergence en Afrique établit ainsi une classification des pays africains en les qualifiant d’« émergent », de « seuil », de « potentiel », ou « autre ». Selon cet index, il n’y aurait que 11 pays émergents en Afrique sur 54. Les résultats sont, par ailleurs, très contrastés non seulement selon les régions du continent mais à l’intérieur même de ces régions.
En 2018, quid de l’émergence ?
En 2018, que reste-t-il de la croissance pérenne et des champions de l’émergence d’il y a dix ans : Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria, Éthiopie, Tchad et Rwanda ? Comme le montrent le graphique et la carte ci-dessous, pas grand-chose.
Croissance du PIB ( % annuel). Données des comptes nationaux de la Banque mondiale et fichiers de données des comptes nationaux de l’OCDE. Banque mondiale, CC BY
Parmi eux, le Rwanda est le seul à confirmer dans la durée ses bonnes performances (taux moyen de croissance du PIB de 8 % de 2001 à 2015, réduction du taux de pauvreté de 44 à 39 %, etc.).
Après avoir tenté de dissimuler au moins deux milliards de dollars d’emprunts, le Mozambique est en pleine crise de surendettement ; l’Angola est passé d’un taux de croissance du PIB de 20 % en 2006 à 1 % en 2017 et a frôlé le défaut de paiement ; le Nigeria – qui est entré en récession en 2016 (-1,6 %) sous l’effet de la chute des cours du baril – n’en sort que très timidement en 2017 (+0,8 %) ; l’Éthiopie connaît une crise politique complexe depuis 2015 ; et le Tchad, producteur de pétrole depuis le début du siècle, fait la manche auprès des pays du Golfe arabique et vient s’ajouter à la longue liste des pays qui peinent à payer leurs fonctionnaires. Les marges de manœuvre budgétaires de ces gouvernements sont réduites à peu de choses après deux ou trois années extrêmement difficiles.
La classe moyenne revue et corrigée
En ce qui concerne les classes moyennes africaines érigées en symbole du dynamisme du continent et en nouveau marché prometteur du capitalisme de consommation, l’enthousiasme initial du rapport de la BAD en 2011 a été tempéré par d’autres études.
En effet, pour la BAD, un Africain appartient à la classe moyenne lorsque son revenu quotidien est compris entre 2,2 et 20 dollars. Mais appartenir à la classe moyenne ne signifie pas seulement être capable de se nourrir, de se loger et de se vêtir aujourd’hui mais aussi demain et les jours qui suivent. Par conséquent, selon d’autres travaux, il est plus exact de mettre la barre monétaire de la classe moyenne à partir d’un revenu de 12 dollars par jour.
Du coup, le poids de la classe moyenne africaine sur le continent s’approcherait davantage des 13 % que des 34 %, représentant près de 143 millions d’Africains… Ce n’est donc plus un Africain sur trois qui appartiendrait à la classe moyenne mais un sur dix. Une classe moyenne africaine émerge (les Cheetahs au Kenya, les Black Diamonds en Afrique du Sud), mais les pauvres restent encore très majoritaires.
La dépendance économique, paradigme fondamental de l’Afrique
Le paradigme de la dépendance change mais persiste. Des trois facteurs-clés de la croissance économique (technologie, capital et travail), deux viennent d’ailleurs.
Les inventions de la troisième révolution industrielle qui changent le quotidien des Africains n’ont pas eu lieu en Afrique. De même, les transferts financiers des migrants, les investissements directs étrangers et l’aide publique au développement représentent 2,5 fois le montant des capitaux privés investis par le secteur privé du continent.
Qu’il s’agisse d’un pays avec de bonnes performances comme le Rwanda ou d’un des pays les plus pauvres du monde comme le Burundi, l’aide étrangère continue d’assurer une part substantielle de leur budget national et donc de la viabilité financière des États africains. Pour le premier, celle-ci évolue entre 30 et 40 % du budget national, tandis qu’avant la suspension de l’aide des bailleurs européens en 2016, celle-ci représentait plus de 50 % du budget burundais.

Du XXe au XXIe siècle, la dépendance de l’Afrique est résiliente et elle présente toujours les mêmes symptômes. Ainsi, les pays producteurs de matières premières (hydrocarbures et minerais) n’ont pas profité de la décennie des cours élevés pour diversifier leur économie et restent prisonniers de l’évolution cyclique du marché des matières premières. Les accès de nationalisme des ressources des gouvernants quand les cours remontent dissimule mal les rentes personnelles qu’ils retirent de cette servitude volontaire.
Le surendettement qui a frappé les économies africaines dans les années 80 est de retour. Selon le FMI, huit pays sont en situation de surendettement (dont celui qui était la « success story » économique du continent, le Mozambique) et autant présentent un risque élevé d’y basculer. La dette publique en Afrique subsaharienne représentait 45 % du PIB fin 2017, en hausse de 40 % en trois ans ! Le gouvernement chinois qui est désormais le grand prêteur de l’Afrique s’inquiète maintenant ouvertement de la non-solvabilité de certains gouvernements africains.
La bonne vieille dépendance a néanmoins changé de visage : au XXIe siècle, ceux dont les gouvernements africains dépendent ne sont plus les mêmes. Dans un contexte où l’aide publique occidentale diminue tendanciellement et où les gouvernements occidentaux se désengagent d’Afrique (sauf évidemment en ce qui concerne la lutte contre les djihadistes), d’autres prêteurs (chinois ou arabes) et les multinationales sont devenues les nouveaux maîtres du jeu, comme l’a appris le président tchadien Idriss Déby à ses dépens.
De quoi l’émergence est-elle le nom ?
L’émergence apparaît simultanément comme une actualisation du vocabulaire, l’autre mot pour dire « développement » au siècle de la globalisation, comme un concept déjà dépassé qui ne parlerait que de la première décennie de ce siècle et comme un coup de marketing par définition éphémère.
Pourtant elle met au grand jour d’importantes et durables réalités :
L’émergence est avant tout un rattrapage. Si le continent africain émerge, c’est aussi le dernier à le faire. En 2014, avec un milliard d’habitants, la production d’électricité sur le continent s’élevait à 80 GW, soit l’équivalent de celle de la Corée du Sud qui compte 51 millions d’habitants. De même, l’Afrique subsaharienne est le dernier continent qui se met à produire l’invention symbole du XXe siècle : l’automobile. Le rattrapage est certes en cours avec une timide reprise de la croissance depuis 2017 mais, compte tenu du fait que le reste du monde évolue économiquement et technologiquement de plus en plus vite, la course sera longue et probablement pas en ligne droite mais plutôt en zigzags.
La question de la gouvernance publique reste centrale pour réduire la dépendance. Cela exige un gouvernement intègre, volontariste et capable d’agir dans la longue durée pour développer de manière endogène les facteurs de croissance. À ce titre, la formation de la main-d’œuvre africaine devrait être une priorité réelle au lieu d’être un engagement cosmétique des gouvernements.
Après avoir été l’arrière-cour des puissances européennes et de leurs rivalités au XIXe siècle, l’Afrique est au XXIe siècle l’arrière-cour des puissances émergentes et de leurs rivalités. Depuis le début du siècle, la Chine, le Brésil, l’Inde, la Turquie, la Corée du Sud, etc., ont développé de nouvelles relations multidimensionnelles avec les pays africains, y compris pour certains d’entre eux des relations militaires. La lutte entre le Qatar et l’Arabie saoudite résonne jusqu’au Sahel et dans la Corne de l’Afrique grâce à la diplomatie du pétrodollar à l’égard de gouvernements africains ayant désespérément besoin d’argent et prêts à se louer à un camp ou un autre.
Ce qui émerge de l’Afrique : la puissance des autres et plus particulièrement de la Chine
L’Afrique est le lieu où les vrais émergents (asiatiques et arabes) projettent en premier leur nouvelle puissance et s’offrent de nouvelles clientèles dans le cadre d’une compétition acharnée. Même les vieilles puissances sur le retour (comme la Russie) y font aujourd’hui leur come-back.
À ce jeu, la Chine reste en tête. Pendant ces 20 dernières années, sa croissance l’a rendu avide de matières premières africaines et elle est désormais le premier partenaire commercial et premier bailleur bilatéral du continent.
Paradoxalement, ce qui émerge derrière l’émergence de l’Afrique, c’est avant tout la puissance chinoise. Or dans un continent très dépendant financièrement, la position dominante chinoise n’est pas sans conséquence politique pour les Africains, y compris en termes de politique intérieure. Les appuis qu’apporte Pékin au régime du président Kabila contre son peuple, en République démocratique du Congo (RDC), et la bienveillance de la Chine à l’égard de la mise à l’écart du président Mugabe au Zimbabwe sont les premiers indices d’ingérence de la part d’une nouvelle puissance internationale qui se targue d’être non impérialiste par nature mais s’implante militairement sur le continent et joue de sa domination économique quand bon lui semble.

"Les zèbres ressemblent à des chevaux à bien des égards (ou plutôt à des poneys, vu leur taille). Pourtant, les chevaux ont été domestiqués, tandis que les zèbres sont restés sauvages, car il existe des différences fondamentales entre ces deux animaux. Alors, comment les zèbres sont-ils parvenus à éviter le destin de bêtes de somme ou de bêtes de course ? Et qui s’en sort le mieux aujourd’hui, du cheval ou du zèbre ?
Évidemment, les humains ont tenté de monter et de faire galoper les zèbres, à la fois par attrait de la nouveauté et en raison de leurs apparentes similitudes avec les chevaux. Le film de 2005, Racing Stripes (Courses de rayures) raconte ainsi l’histoire d’un jeune zèbre qui veut participer à des courses de chevaux – sauf que les réalisateurs ont dû tourner certaines scènes avec un cheval pour doubler le zèbre (à l’image, c’est la queue qui trahit le cheval).
Un ancêtre commun
La crinière et la queue du zèbre ressemblent davantage à celles des ânes, ce qui reflète l’évolution du gène Equus. Même si les chevaux, les ânes et les zèbres ont un ancêtre commun, l’Hyracotherium, qui vivait en Europe et en Amérique du Nord il y a 55 millions d’années, les divergences dans leurs gènes montrent que le zèbre et l’âne sont plus proches entre eux que l’âne ou le zèbre ne le sont du cheval.
Les équidés nord-américains (les équidés désignant la famille des chevaux) ont disparu il y a 8 à 10 000 ans de cela. En Europe comme en Asie, l’homme du paléolithique a parcouru les plaines pour chasser sans relâche les troupeaux de chevaux sauvages. Le changement climatique, le boisement et la chasse ont progressivement repoussé les animaux vers les zones semi-désertiques d’Asie centrale.
L’ancêtre sauvage du cheval domestique (Equus ferus) a été apprivoisé pour la première fois à l’ouest de la steppe eurasienne, zone où l’on a retrouvé les premières traces archéologiques de sa domestication. Des études récentes montrent également que les chevaux sauvages venaient grossir les rangs des troupeaux de chevaux domestiqués, tandis qu’ils s’éparpillaient dans toute l’Eurasie.
Chevaux à tout faire
Les chevaux ont d’abord été domestiqués pour leur viande, mais leur immense potentiel pour le transport, la communication et la guerre en ont rapidement fait des alliés importants du développement de la civilisation. En Mongolie, le pays du cheval, c’est sur son fier destrier que le légendaire guerrier Gengis Khan a conquis des terres qui s’étendaient de la Hongrie à la Corée et de la Sibérie au Tibet, au XIIIe siècle.
Alors, si le cheval a joué un rôle si important dans notre civilisation, pourquoi n’est-ce pas le cas du zèbre ? Les premiers humains sont apparus sur le continent africain, il paraît donc étonnant qu’ils n’aient pas cherché à exploiter le potentiel du zèbre, qui vivait dans les parages.
Contrairement aux équidés eurasiens, cependant, la population de zèbres africains était relativement protégée et particulièrement adaptée à son environnement. Tous les équidés sont des herbivores, et en tant que proies, ils ont tous développé une réaction puissante en cas de danger : ils fuient, ou ils se battent. Afin de survivre dans un environnement peuplé de grands prédateurs tels que le lion, le guépard et la hyène, le zèbre est devenu un animal très vif et très réactif capable de s’enfuir quand il est confronté au danger et qui sait aussi se défendre vigoureusement s’il est capturé.
Des ruades et des morsures
La ruade d’un zèbre peut casser la mâchoire d’un lion. Le zèbre peut aussi infliger des morsures terribles et possède un réflexe d’esquive qui empêche quiconque de l’attraper au lasso : autant de puissantes réactions d’évitement qui ont peut-être été favorisées par la familiarité des zèbres avec les chasseurs-cueilleurs.
En somme, le zèbre n’est pas très porté sur l’espèce humaine, et il ne répond pas aux critères requis pour la domestication d’une espèce animale. Selon l’explorateur et savant Francis Galton (un parent de Charles Darwin), ces critères incluent que l’animal ait un certain goût du confort, qu’il soit facile de s’en occuper, qu’il soit utile à l’homme et qu’il en apprécie la compagnie.
Pour Galton, le zèbre est l’exemple type de l’espèce impossible à domestiquer. Il indique que les Boers, en Afrique du Sud, ont essayé plusieurs fois de harnacher des zèbres. Même s’ils y sont parvenus quelquefois, la nature sauvage et têtue de l’animal déjouait la plupart de leurs tentatives.
Une mise en garde à prendre au sérieux. Shutterstock
Libres mais menacés
Bien qu’il semble possible de domestiquer un zèbre isolé, cette espèce n’est pas une bonne candidate à la domestication. Outre la nature intraitable du zèbre et son puissant instinct de survie, le fait qu’il soit un « aliment pour lion » l’a peut-être rendu moins attrayant aux yeux des premiers humains.
La domestication et l’élevage sélectif ont certainement transformé les caractéristiques physiques et comportementales du cheval, qui à l’origine était sans doute plus petit, plus sauvage et plus proche du zèbre que le cheval d’aujourd’hui.
Et même si les chevaux travaillent dur, vivent dans des environnements plus urbanisés que les zèbres et font ce que leur propriétaire leur demande, ils vivent en sécurité et jouissent d’un certain confort. En réalité, la domestication les a sauvés de l’extinction. En tant que stratégie de survie, la domestication a même très bien marché pour la population de chevaux, qui atteint désormais 60 millions d’individus.
De leur côté, les zèbres sont aujourd’hui moins de 800 000, les humains étant la plus grande menace pour leur survie. La liberté leur a coûté cher.",Pourquoi les zèbres n’ont pas été domestiqués,home page
"À l’heure où le tourisme est un phénomène mondial massif, concernant plus d’un milliard de personnes par an et générant annuellement près de 1 500 milliards de dollars de recettes, la notion de « patrimoine mondial », promue par l’Unesco, acquiert une importance centrale. Depuis 1972, l’Unesco, avec la « convention sur la protection du patrimoine culturel et naturel mondial », a créé sa liste du patrimoine mondial, qui recense des sites considérés comme ayant une valeur exceptionnelle.
Si le classement Unesco ne donne pas droit automatiquement à des aides financières pour protéger ces sites, et si l’Unesco reste impuissante devant les destructions et les dégradations de sites classés, comme la destruction des bouddhas de Bâmiyân par les talibans en Afghanistan en 2001 ou celle du temple de Bel à Palmyre en Syrie en août 2015, la liste Unesco du patrimoine mondial n’en est pas moins une réalisation importante de l’Unesco et le patrimoine est le domaine d’activité de cette organisation qui est le plus connu du grand public.
La liste du patrimoine mondial de l’Unesco, créée en 1972, est un objet de prestige et de convoitises pour les États, soucieux de faire valoir leurs sites historiques ou naturels et de les promouvoir sur la scène internationale.
Un patrimoine matériel immatériel et documentaire
À cette liste, qui comporte aujourd’hui plus de 1 000 sites, s’est ajoutée en 2003 la liste du patrimoine immatériel, qui rassemble non pas des sites physiques mais des pratiques, traditions, danses, coutumes et savoir-faire traditionnels, et qui a été conçue en partie pour contrebalancer le flagrant déséquilibre de la liste précédente, laquelle rassemble une majorité écrasante de sites européens tandis que l’Afrique est gravement sous-représentée. Et l’Afrique compte surtout des sites « naturels » tandis que l’Europe regorge de sites classés « culturels » (églises, châteaux…) qui sont déjà bien mis en valeur et n’ont pas forcément besoin d’une protection supplémentaire.
Enfin, l’Unesco a créé, en 1995, un registre appelé « Mémoire du monde » qui recense des éléments importants, et parfois menacés ou fragiles, du patrimoine documentaire de l’humanité, par exemple la tapisserie de Bayeux.
Une source de luttes de pouvoir
Or, ces mécanismes, en apparence consensuels et propres à susciter le sentiment, pour les peuples, d’avoir un patrimoine culturel commun à préserver, entraînent au contraire en bien des cas sinon des conflits, du moins des luttes de pouvoir, des rivalités qui témoignent que les questions de patrimoine sont détournées à des fins économiques, politiques ou géopolitiques.
L’exemple le plus flagrant est le conflit entre la Chine et le Japon généré par la demande d’inscription sur le registre Mémoire du monde, récemment, par le Japon, de 333 lettres de kamikazes japonais de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Ces lettres d’adieu de combattant adressées à leurs parents avant de se lancer dans leur assaut ultime, reflètent souvent leur fierté de combattre pour ce régime. Or celui-ci était impérialiste, raciste, et allié de l’Allemagne nazie !
Ugaki Matome, kamikaze japonais, avant sa dernière mission.
La Chine a donc protesté, et, en retour, a demandé, et obtenu, l’inscription sur le registre Mémoire du monde d’une somme de documents sur le massacre de Nankin, perpétré en 1937 par les forces japonaises, et au cours duquel 300 000 Chinois auraient été tués. Ainsi, on voit bien que le registre Mémoire du monde est devenu le théâtre sur lequel s’est déplacé l’affrontement Chine/Japon. La mémoire de la Seconde Guerre mondiale est un sujet sensible pour ces deux pays.
Un tourisme de masse sur les sites classés
Plusieurs cas illustrent le caractère sensible des mécanismes de protection du patrimoine mis en place par l’Unesco. Bien souvent, la notion de patrimoine culturel mondial a été détournée de son but officiel, et a été utilisée comme un outil touristique, ou à des fins politiques et économiques. L’anthropologue David Berliner, étudiant les politiques patrimoniales de l’Unesco à Luang Prabang (Laos), lieu classé au patrimoine mondial, parle d’« unescoïsation » de cette petite ville ; il montre qu’une conséquence paradoxale de la protection accordée par l’Unesco est l’intense « mise en tourisme du lieu ».
Et cette mise en tourisme s’accompagne d’une sorte de mise en scène de traditions idéalisées et qui ne correspondent pas toujours à la réalité historique. Certains éléments de ce passé sont gommés comme les épisodes de la guerre du Vietnam, ou la période coloniale.
Parfois, comme sur le continent africain, le résultat de l’inscription d’un site sur la liste du patrimoine mondial peut être négatif. Saskia Cousin et J.-L. Martineau ont analysé l’instrumentalisation des coutumes, des traditions et du patrimoine provoquée par l’inscription sur la liste du patrimoine mondial. Dans leur étude sur le « bois sacré » d’Osun Osogbo au Nigeria, inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial depuis 2005, ils montrent l’importance des actions de lobbying, avec des enjeux politiques et économiques.

Dans ce cas précis, le but politique était de donner à la nouvelle capitale de l’État d’Osun une profondeur historique, dont elle manquait, contre la ville rivale d’Ife-Ife, plus ancrée dans l’histoire. L’inscription du bois sacré d’Osun Osogbo est le résultat de près de quinze ans d’efforts de l’État d’Osun pour se construire une légitimité historique et culturelle. Par le biais de la liste du patrimoine mondial, outil de légitimation, la culture peut être manipulée, instrumentalisée à des fins politiques ou économiques.
Des conséquences néfastes pour la population
Les effets du classement de sites sur la prestigieuse liste du patrimoine mondial peuvent avoir des effets négatifs pour une partie de la population. Ainsi, à Panama City le classement sur cette liste en 1997 du quartier historique, le Casco Antiguo, a entraîné la relégation des plus pauvres vers la périphérie, parallèlement à la mise en tourisme de ce quartier central.
Le Casco Antiguo, qui au moment de son classement était un quartier délabré, a fait l’objet d’une transformation en profondeur, qui ont entraîné une brutale éviction des classes populaires ; leurs portes et leurs fenêtres ont été murées pour les expulser, tandis que le quartier était restauré et se gentrifiait.
Il est maintenant investi par de riches étrangers qui rachètent les plus belles bâtisses de l’époque coloniale avant de les revendre à la découpe. Le tourisme à Panama City a augmenté de façon exponentielle depuis le classement du site sur la liste de l’Unesco, mais il en résulte une standardisation de l’espace urbain et une polarisation des inégalités.
Ces exemples montrent à quel point les enjeux patrimoniaux sont mêlés à des enjeux économiques, sociaux, politiques, et à des enjeux de domination. En outre, par l’importance du rôle des fonctionnaires et experts occidentaux dans cette action patrimoniale de l’Unesco, on peut aussi reprocher à cette institution d’imposer aux pays du Sud une conception « occidentale » du patrimoine.
Malgré ces limites, on peut saluer l’action de l’Unesco pour préserver et promouvoir le patrimoine mondial. Le déséquilibre qu’on observe sur la liste du patrimoine mondial n’est que le reflet d’une inégalité économique, sociale et culturelle Nord-Sud, qu’il est urgent de combler.",Les effets pervers du classement au patrimoine mondial de l’Unesco,arts + culture
"Tout comme les humains, les animaux doivent accomplir un certain nombre de choses pour s’assurer qu’ils parviendront à transmettre leurs gènes : manger, éviter de se faire manger, se reproduire et dormir. Si l’un de ces impératifs biologiques n’est pas respecté, c’est la mort assurée. Pourtant, lorsqu’on dort, on ne peut accomplir aucune de ces activités. C’est là un des grands mystères de la science : pourquoi dormons-nous ?
En ce qui concerne les humains, les scientifiques ont formulé plusieurs hypothèses. Pour certains chercheurs, le sommeil permet de nettoyer notre cerveau des déchets métaboliques produits par l’activité des neurones ; pour d’autres, il sert à consolider la mémoire. Pour tester la validité de ces hypothèses, on peut observer si elles s’appliquent au sommeil des animaux qui ne sont habituellement pas étudiés sur ce plan, comme les grands mammifères africains.
La recherche a déjà démontré que plus les mammifères sont grands, moins ils dorment. En principe, donc, les éléphants africains – les adultes pèsent entre 3 000 et 5 000 kilos – ne devraient pas dormir beaucoup. Pour vérifier si un animal dort, on enregistre ses ondes cérébrales en posant des électrodes sur son crâne : les caractéristiques de l’activité globale du cerveau montrent si le cerveau est éveillé, s’il est dans une phase de sommeil profond ou dans une phase de sommeil paradoxal (celui des rêves). Mais avec les éléphants, c’est impossible d’un point de vue chirurgical, en raison de la particularité de leur crâne, constitué en grande partie d’un immense sinus frontal.
Pour surmonter ce problème, notre équipe de neurobiologie comparée de l’Université des Witwatersrand a adapté un compteur d’activité utilisé dans les études sur le sommeil humain, avec l’aide de nos collègues de l'ONG Elephants Without Borders et ceux de l'université américaine UCLA. Cela nous a permis de mesurer les habitudes de sommeil de deux matriarches dans une population d’éléphants sauvages.
Les résultats obtenus, qui ont été publiés dans le journal PLoS ONE, sont importants pour deux raisons. D’abord, en étudiant le sommeil à travers les animaux, nous pouvons tenter d’améliorer la qualité du sommeil et la qualité de vie des humains. Mais comprendre le sommeil chez des animaux comme les éléphants nous aide aussi à mieux les comprendre – améliorant ainsi notre capacité à développer des stratégies de gestion et de conservation de la biodiversité.
Les résultats
L’appareil que nous avons utilisé mesurait l’activité des éléphants en comptabilisant le nombre d’accélérations de leurs mouvements par minute. Il est facile à implanter sous la peau, pour savoir quand l’éléphant bouge ou reste immobile. En observant les éléphants dans la nature, nous avons constaté que la partie de leur corps la plus mobile était leur tronc. Nous en avons déduit que si le tronc ne bougeait pas pendant cinq minutes, l’éléphant était susceptible d’être endormi – c’est donc à cet endroit que nous avons implanté le capteur d’activité.
En combinant ce système avec un collier GPS et un gyroscope – qui mesurait les mouvements corporels dans les plans x, y et z, nous avons fait quatre observations vraiment intéressantes :
Les éléphants dormaient en moyenne deux heures par jour ;
La plupart du temps, ils dormaient debout, mais ils s’allongeaient pour dormir tous les trois ou quatre jours ;
Certaines nuits, ils ne dormaient pas et parcouraient une distance de 30 kilomètres ;
Lorsqu’ils s’endormaient ou se réveillaient, cela coïncidait avec des conditions environnementales non corrélées au lever ou au coucher du soleil.
The secrets of elephant sleep, revealed…
Les recherches existantes menées sur des éléphants en captivité ont révélé qu’ils dormaient en moyenne entre quatre et six heures par jour. Cela s’explique : ils ont beaucoup de temps pour dormir et n’ont pas besoin de marcher pour trouver la nourriture dont ils ont besoin pour rester en forme, leur régime alimentaire est de meilleure qualité, et ils n’ont aucun prédateur.
Un grand éléphant doit manger environ 300 kg de nourriture – de qualité nutritionnelle médiocre – chaque jour. Cela lui laisse peu de temps pour dormir. Le cerveau des éléphants, comme celui des humains, comprend des orexines, des neurotransmetteurs qui contrôlent l’équilibre entre la satiété et l’état d’éveil : si vous avez eu assez à manger, les neurones se calment et vous permettent de vous coucher. Sinon, ils vous gardent éveillés.
Cet équilibre entre satiété et état d’éveil, combiné à leur régime alimentaire, explique pourquoi les mammifères les plus gros dorment moins, mais aussi pourquoi les herbivores dorment moins que les carnivores et les omnivores (comme les humains). Les données recueillies sur les éléphants renforcent cette idée émergente dans la recherche sur le sommeil et permettent d’expliquer pourquoi l’éléphant dort si peu.
En captivité, les éléphants passent une grande partie de leur temps à dormir couchés, mais ils dorment parfois debout. Avec les données combinées du gyroscope et du capteur d’activité, nous avons constaté que les éléphants sauvages dormaient principalement debout. Ils ne dorment couchés que tous les trois ou quatre jours, pendant environ une heure.
Pendant le sommeil paradoxal, le tonus musculaire des mammifères disparaît. Donc, pour qu’un éléphant rentre dans le sommeil paradoxal, il lui faut s’allonger, car sans aucun tonus musculaire, il ne peut pas rester debout, à moins qu’il ne s’appuie contre un arbre ou un grand rocher.
Pour certains chercheurs, le sommeil paradoxal sert à consolider la mémoire : les expériences vécues au cours de la journée seraient converties en mémoire à long terme pendant le sommeil paradoxal. Les éléphants ont une bonne mémoire à long terme, mais n’entrent dans le sommeil paradoxal que tous les trois ou quatre jours. Cela permet de penser que la consolidation de la mémoire n’est peut-être pas la fonction du sommeil paradoxal.
Indicateurs environnementaux
Il est arrivé que les éléphants ne dorment pas de la nuit. Cela s’est produit trois fois pour un éléphant, deux fois pour l’autre. Ces jours-là, peu de temps après le coucher du soleil, les éléphants ont été perturbés, peut-être par des lions, des braconniers ou même un éléphant mâle en musth, un état le rendant particulièrement agressif. Pendant le reste de la nuit, les éléphants ont parcouru une distance d’environ 30 kilomètres. Ce comportement n’avait jamais été enregistré précédemment et indique que les éléphants ont vraiment besoin de beaucoup d’espace, un élément important en termes de conservation – dans les petites réserves, ils sont à l’étroit.
Enfin, les moments où les éléphants sont allés dormir (début du sommeil) et se sont réveillés (sortie du sommeil) n’étaient pas liés au coucher et au lever du soleil. Par contre, ces deux moments étaient fortement liés à certaines sensations associées à l’environnement : un mélange de température, d’humidité, de vitesse du vent et de rayonnement solaire. Il semble que certains indicateurs environnementaux soient importants pour les éléphants, pour aller dormir et se réveiller au bon moment. En examinant cela de plus près, nous pourrions être en mesure d’ajuster l’environnement dans lequel nous dormons afin d’améliorer la qualité de nos nuits de sommeil.",Ce que le sommeil des éléphants nous apprend sur le nôtre,home page
"Traversant six siècles d’histoire (de 1420 à nos jours) au creuset de tous les empires coloniaux, depuis les conquistadors, en passant par les systèmes esclavagistes et jusqu’à la période postcoloniale, notre ouvrage Sexe, race et colonies. La domination des corps du XVᵉ à nos jours explore le rôle central du sexe dans les rapports de pouvoir.
Il interroge aussi la manière dont les pays esclavagistes et colonisateurs ont (ré)inventé l’« Autre » pour mieux le dominer, prendre possession de son corps comme de son territoire, tout en décryptant l’incroyable production visuelle qui a fabriqué le regard exotique et les fantasmes de l’Occident : autant d’images qui reflètent la domination raciale et sexuelle.
La compréhension de leur contexte de production, l’appréciation de leur diffusion, de leur réception, de leur importance dans l’histoire visuelle, visent à décentrer les regards et à déconstruire ce qui a été si minutieusement et massivement fabriqué. Projet inédit tant par son ambition éditoriale, que par sa volonté de rassembler une pluralité de regards et d’approches critiques, l’objectif de ce livre est de dresser un panorama de ce passé oublié et ignoré, jusqu’à ses héritages contemporains, en suivant pas à pas le long récit de la domination des corps.

Sexualité, domination et colonisation. Trois termes qui se croisent et s’enchevêtrent en effet tout au long des six siècles de pratiques et de représentations qui composent ce livre. Or, si l’histoire des sexualités aux colonies est un sujet de recherche depuis plus de trente ans, il reste méconnu dans son ampleur. Pourtant, la domination sexuelle, dans les espaces colonisés comme dans les États-Unis de la ségrégation, fut un long processus d’asservissement produisant des imaginaires complexes qui, entre exotisme et érotisme, se nourrissent d’une véritable fascination/répulsion pour les corps racisés.
Ceci explique pourquoi, les multiples héritages contemporains de cette histoire conditionnent, encore largement, les relations entre populations occidentales du Nord et celles des ex-colonisées du Sud. Car, si les imaginaires sexuels coloniaux ont façonné les mentalités des sociétés occidentales, ils ont aussi bien sûr, déterminé celles des dominé·e·s. Un travail de déconstruction devient, donc, aujourd’hui plus que jamais, nécessaire, en s’attachant notamment aux images produites tout au long de cette histoire.
« Comme il vous plaira. Vierges noires de Djibouti », couverture du magazine Voilà, 16 janvier 1932. Sexe, race et colonies
La colonie, territoire de la domination sexuelle
La sexualité aux colonies n’est bridée par aucun tabou, y compris celui de l’enfance : les images proposées exhibant souvent des jeunes filles non-pubères (ainsi, bien que plus rarement, que des jeunes garçons) dans des mises en scène fortement sexualisées. La violence des fantasmes projetés sur les populations colonisées est donc sans limites, puisque le corps de l’« Autre » est lui-même placé en dehors du champ licite des normes, plus proche de l’animal et du monstre que de l’humain, plus en affinité avec la nature qu’avec la culture.
Ceci explique pourquoi le corps de l’« Autre » est pensé simultanément comme symbole d’innocence et de dépravations multiples : un corps qui excite autant qu’il effraie. Dans ce contexte, les femmes « indigènes » sont revêtues d’une innocence sexuelle qui les conduit avec constance au « péché » ou à une « dépravation sexuelle atavique » liée à leur « race », confortant la position conquérante et dominante et du maître et du colonisateur.
L’existence de ces femmes « Autres » toujours vues comme faciles, lascives, lubriques, perverses et donc forcément insatiables permet aussi de construire, en miroir, l’image de l’épouse blanche idéale, pudique et chaste, réduite à une sexualité purement reproductive.

La liberté sexuelle des hommes blancs aux colonies ne saurait, en effet, être transférée aux femmes issues des métropoles coloniales. Celles-ci y sont, a contrario, plus surveillées encore, du fait qu’elles doivent nécessairement incarner l’exemplarité sexuelle et morale de la colonie, à laquelle les hommes blancs dérogent en général. Ainsi, le « gigantesque lupanar » figuré par la domination esclavagiste et coloniale permet-il aux colonisateurs de se penser et de se vivre en maîtres dans des espaces où leurs possibilités sexuelles sont maximisées au regard des normes et des interdits de leurs propres sociétés tout en excluant leurs femmes de ce même droit. Ceci explique pourquoi les pratiques sexuelles, amoureuses et conjugales dérogent, presque partout, aux règles, aux décrets et aux lois édictées par ceux-là même qui les transgressent allégrement et continûment.

Cette liberté sexuelle du maître et/ou du colonisateur se heurte pourtant, paradoxalement, aux préceptes moraux, aux interdits raciaux, au refus des femmes blanches d’accepter la cohabitation, jugée humiliante et déshonorante par la plupart d’entre elles, avec d’autres femmes et d’autres familles ; et, in fine, à la peur croissante, dès la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle, d’un métissage qui fait écho à l’idée de dégénérescence et de disparition de la « race » blanche. Cette nouvelle configuration moralisatrice, hygiéniste et prophylactique complexe va conduire néanmoins à un appel croissant, quoique tardif, aux femmes blanches pour peupler les empires, assurer des descendances sans métissage et moraliser les mœurs coloniales. Ces véritables campagnes de recrutements d’épouses – ou de prostituées pour les maisons de tolérance – vont souvent s’effectuer, dans un premier temps, dans les marges des sociétés européennes – orphelinats, hospices, asiles, prisons, bordels… – parmi des catégories de femmes stigmatisées, telles les délinquantes, les filles-mères ou les prostituées : les métropoles coloniales se débarrassant ainsi d’éléments supposément « asociaux » et/ou « immoraux ».
De surcroît, partout dans les espaces colonisés, la question raciale est au cœur de la construction des sexualités puisqu’elle y est le pivot central de l’organisation politique, économique et sociale, particulièrement dans les configurations esclavagistes des Caraïbes, du Brésil ou des États-Unis. Sur cet ensemble de questions concernant toutes les aires géographiques et tous les empires coloniaux, et ce quelle que soit l’époque, les écrivains et les artistes ont laissé leurs empreintes tout en participant à la construction du regard des métropolitains sur les « Autres ».
Une immense production d’images
Très tôt, comme le montrent les œuvres rassemblées dans cet ouvrage (plus de 1 200 documents reproduits et majoritairement inédits), les artistes dépeignent les sociétés coloniales et, malgré les interdits, évoquent les métissages tout en éclairant les hiérarchies sociales indexées sur le taux de mélanine des différentes populations. Fondées sur des préjugés, notamment religieux, ces hiérarchies ont alors légitimé la domination raciale de l’époque moderne formant ainsi le premier substrat d’un racisme qui s’incarnait à la fois dans la couleur de peau et dans le statut socio-économique. Les premières images produites, du début du XVe siècle jusqu’à la fin du XVIIe siècle, invitent aussi au rêve et témoignent, très majoritairement, d’une admiration et d’une fascination pour les peuples « exotiques » et leur corporalité.
Cependant, la généralisation de l’esclavage entre l’Afrique et les Amériques, les relations conflictuelles dans l’espace méditerranéen, la montée en puissance des empires coloniaux et l’émergence du racisme scientifique vont progressivement effacer ce « temps de la sidération » au bénéfice de représentations de plus en plus souvent dévalorisantes. Au tournant des XVIIIe et XIXe siècles, s’opère, en effet, une mutation décisive de sens qui va transformer le « préjugé de couleur » en raciologie. Sexualité, prostitution, homosexualité et « race » s’entremêlent donc inexorablement durant cette période, qui commence en 1830-1840, traverse tout le XIXe siècle et s’achève autour de 1920.
Des artistes de tous les pays vont dans ce cadre bâtir, dans tous les domaines artistiques possibles (dessin, gravure, peinture…), une vision du monde qui bouleverse les représentations de ces Ailleurs, jusqu’à la rupture majeure consécutive à l’émergence de nouveaux supports visuels tels la photographie, les affiches illustrées et les objets du quotidien bon marché, diffusant très largement, désormais, le goût orientalisant, africaniste ou japonisant, tout en exotisant, érotisant et/ou pornographiant l’« Autre » à outrance.
« Scène érotique entre deux hommes dans un décor orientalisant », photographie, tirage albuminé, c. 1880. Sexe, race et colonies
La démocratisation du porno colonial, à la charnière des XIXe et XXe siècles, figure, en effet, les colonies comme des « empires du vice », thème présent également dans la fiction romanesque ou pseudo-scientifique, comme en témoigne le célèbre livre du docteur Jacobus, L’Art d’aimer aux colonies (1893). Très vite, l’industrie cinématographique, qui s’impose comme le grand média de masse de la période tant en Europe qu’aux États-Unis, va utiliser le potentiel érotique des colonies mettant en images de manière récurrente des hommes blancs présentés comme les maîtres incontestés des espaces colonisés, les « protecteurs » des femmes blanches, et les « séducteurs » et les « libérateurs » des femmes « indigènes », mais aussi de mythiques « femmes fatales » orientales ou asiatiques.
Le siècle de la « beauté métisse »
Enfin, le XXe siècle accouche d’un nouveau paradigme en forme d’utopie qui trouve son expression en de nombreuses images reflétées sur des supports multiples : celui d’une « beauté métisse ». Mais partout, de l’Asie du Sud-Est aux Indes, de l’Afrique subsaharienne au Maghreb, des Antilles à la Polynésie, ces mutations s’accompagnent de vifs questionnements, tel celui concernant la place à donner aux enfants métis : ceux-ci devenant les « enfants perdus » de sociétés encore très majoritairement fracturées par les color lines, légales ou non. Ces nouveaux enjeux, enclenchés par la Grande Guerre, sont ensuite démultipliés par la Seconde Guerre mondiale sur fond de crise migratoire en Europe et aux États-Unis et de contestations anticoloniales de plus en plus vives dans les empires coloniaux.
Cette dernière phase de l’histoire coloniale, enclenchée après 1945, est une période marquée par le déploiement frénétique des violences sexuelles, notamment contre les femmes colonisées, au sein des populations civiles : comme s’il fallait marquer et violenter les corps des colonisés et, ainsi, les punir de leur désir de se débarrasser de leurs oppresseurs. Comme s’il fallait, aussi, détruire ces femmes indigènes devenues les icônes graphiques des mouvements de libération (et de leurs alliés du moment en Chine, en URSS, en Corée ou en Inde) et des combattantes actives militairement et politiquement dans toutes les luttes anticoloniales.

Ainsi, la pratique du viol, au sein du corps expéditionnaire français, durant la guerre d’Indochine (1946-1954) et la guerre d’Algérie (1954-1962) est-elle désormais bien renseignée, comme celle des derniers lynchages – souvent accompagnés d’émasculations – aux États-Unis dans les années 1950. Ailleurs, en Afrique, c’est dans l’Empire britannique que cette violence se révèle à l’occasion de la révolte des Mau-Mau au Kenya entre 1952 et 1960, où des centaines de cas de violences sexuelles sur les femmes (dont des viols) et sur les hommes (dont des castrations) sont recensés.
Ces moments d’ultra-violence sexuelle entrent aussi en résonance avec certains conflits contemporains postcoloniaux, comme le montre l’usage du viol par les troupes étatsuniennes et leurs alliés durant la guerre du Vietnam, de 1955 à 1975, mais aussi par les Soviétiques pendant la première guerre d’Afghanistan, entre 1979 et 1989 et, plus récemment encore, par les troupes alliées en Irak, les Russes en Tchétchénie ou les Peace Corps de l’ONU en République démocratique du Congo.
Héritages et mutations postcoloniales
À partir des années 1970, de nombreux artistes vont engager un travail de déconstruction des stéréotypes coloniaux en prenant comme objet central le corps – tels l’artiste français Jean‑Paul Goude ou l’un des papes de la Pop anglaise Peter Thomas Blake, mais aussi l’ancien membre du Black Panther Party, Emory Douglas –, les institutions sexualisées (harem ou bordel) ou bien la violence sexuelle et le viol. Ainsi, Coco Fusco et Guillermo Gómez-Peña, au travers de leur célèbre installation The Couple in the Cage (1993), ou bien encore le Sud-Africain Brett Bailey, avec Exhibit B (2014), cherchent-ils à déconstruire la puissance des représentations de la domination sexuelle coloniale.
Dans le même ordre d’idées, la Vénus hottentote va, elle aussi, se retrouver au cœur de toute une série d’œuvres postcoloniales, telles Venus Baartman de Tracey Rose, Venus de Suzan-Lori Parks, On t’appelle Vénus de Chantal Loïal, Hottentot Venus 2000 de Renee Cox, dénonçant son calvaire mais tentant de la restituer dans sa dignité, comme dans le film d’Abdellatif Kechiche, Vénus noire.
Bande annonce de Vénus noire, Abdellatif Kechiche, 2010.
Sur tous les continents, des artistes vont porter un œil critique sur ce passé : tous souhaitant dépasser les héritages coloniaux en analysant les effets que les images s’y référant produisent encore aujourd’hui sur les individus et les sociétés.
Tourisme sexuel
Dans un tout autre registre, ces mêmes héritages se perpétuent aussi dans les pays des Suds avec le tourisme sexuel. Celui-ci s’est développé avant les indépendances puis lors des conflits de décolonisation et/ou issus de la Guerre froide (en Asie notamment), et constitue désormais une véritable économie globalisée. De très nombreux pays anciennement colonisés se sont ensuite « spécialisés » dans l’offre sexuelle à destination des Occidentaux, mais aussi des nouveaux pays industrialisés, tels la Chine, la Turquie ou les Émirats du Golfe. Héritier de la prostitution coloniale – et des quartiers réservés comme celui de Bousbir au Maroc ou des bordels destinés à l’armée états-unienne en Thaïlande et aux Philippines… – le tourisme sexuel véhicule toujours les mêmes fantasmes et mobilise les mêmes imaginaires érotiques et pornographiques éculés.
Notons cependant que les migrations Sud/Nord peuvent aussi provoquer des événements où la violence sexuelle extrême est convoquée à l’image des événements de Cologne, en Allemagne, en 2016.
Les Hauts-Parleurs, 2017. À Saly, sur la petite côte du Sénégal, pas loin de Dakar, des jeunes filles à peine sorties de l’adolescence, rivalisent d’ingéniosité pour offrir leurs services aux touristes, dans l’espoir d’un avenir meilleur.
De nombreux exemples interrogent en tout cas ce « droit global » des hommes à s’accaparer, y compris par la violence sexiste et raciste, toutes les femmes : celles considérées, par eux, comme étant les possessions des « Autres », mais aussi évidemment celles appartenant à leur propre famille, groupe, culture, nation, « race »… Angela Davis le soulignait déjà, dans le contexte de l’émergence du mouvement des Black Panthers aux États-Unis dans les années 1970 :
« Ils pensaient – et certains continuent à le penser – que le fait d’être un homme noir leur donnait des droits sur les femmes noires. »

Pourtant, dans la nouvelle réalité qui est la nôtre en ce XXIe siècle naissant, si des structures de domination perdurent incontestablement, d’autres processus inverses se déploient simultanément. Les migrations postcoloniales, au moins dans l’ensemble des anciennes métropoles coloniales, ont ainsi provoqué, presque mécaniquement, la multiplication des unions mixtes et leur acceptation progressive.
Dans la foulée, ce processus a donné corps à un cosmopolitisme globalisé. Que la simple existence de ceux-ci ait déclenché, tout au long de cette longue histoire, des réactions xénophobes plus ou moins constantes ne doit pas faire oublier que la figure des métis.ses est devenue, dans le même temps, un modèle esthétique de référence dans les cultures médiatiques mondiales. Un modèle contesté et/ou récusé, partout, par les suprémacistes de tout bord et les intégristes de toutes religions qui rejettent migrations et minorités au travers de « replis communautaires » polymorphes et accompagnés, le plus souvent, de forts conservatismes culturels et sociétaux, notamment en termes de mœurs.

Quant aux femmes « Autres » toujours catégorisées en types à l’image des « Beurettes » en France, des « Congolaises » en Belgique, des « Pakistanaises » au Royaume-Uni, elles restent assujetties, aussi bien pratiquement que symboliquement, aux rôles prédéfinis par les héritages patriarcaux et/ou coloniaux.
On comprend désormais que la réduction des femmes et des hommes « Autres » à leur sexe/sexualité, principe fondateur de la doxa coloniale depuis l’origine, mais aussi des modèles sociaux de nos cultures désormais globalisées, est loin d’avoir totalement disparu. Et, pourtant, dans le même temps, le métissage est aussi devenu l’horizon d’une utopie censée préfigurer, pour certain·e·s en tout cas, l’éclosion d’une véritable société mondialisée, postraciale et égalitaire, par un effet boomerang que les colonisateurs n’avaient certes pas imaginé quand ils ont, pour la première fois, foulé les terres de l’Amérique, de l’Afrique, de l’Asie et de l’Océanie…

"Tandis que le cancer et d’autres maladies non-infectieuses sont en augmentation dans le monde entier, il devient de plus en plus difficile pour les scientifiques de trouver des traitements efficaces et sans danger. En outre, les bactéries sont devenues plus résistantes aux médicaments disponibles et les substances thérapeutiques de synthèse, plus agressives pour l’organisme.
Ces défis ont conduit à la rechercher de nouvelles solutions en exploitant notamment les substances naturelles comme les plantes médicinales.
La médecine par les plantes existe depuis des milliers d’années. Selon l’Organisation mondiale de la santé, 75 à 80 % de la population mondiale utilise au moins des médicaments à base de plantes.
L’Afrique a sa propre réserve de plantes médicinales, comme celles dont on se sert en Côte d’Ivoire, au Kenya, à l’île Maurice en Afrique du Sud et au Zimbabwe.
J’ai travaillé avec un groupe de scientifiques pour trouver de nouvelles façons d’exploiter les plantes à des fins médicinales. Dans ce but, nous avons étudié les habitudes alimentaires et le comportement de chimpanzés sauvages du Parc National de Taï, situé au sud-ouest de la Côte d’Ivoire. Nous avons identifié ce qu’ils mangeaient, notamment les feuilles, les fruits et les tiges de certains végétaux. Ces plantes ont ensuite été analysées au laboratoire.
Inspirées d’une précédente étude sur les apports énergétiques du régime alimentaire des chimpanzés du parc National de Taï, nos recherches ont porté principalement sur les propriétés médicinales des plantes qu’ils consomment.
Les résultats suggèrent que les chimpanzés mangent des plantes dont les composants renforcent leur système immunitaire et les préservent de certaines maladies. Nos découvertes ouvrent la voie à l’examen des propriétés thérapeutiques de ces plantes pour déterminer leur utilité potentielle dans le traitement de maladies humaines.
Tolérance à la maladie
Les chimpanzés sont les animaux les plus proches des humains sur le plan génétique avec 98 % de leur ADN en commun. Cette proximité génétique indique que ces grands primates partagent avec l’homme certaines maladies en commun comme les candidoses, la maladie à virus Ebola et le VIH/sida. Les chimpanzés ont peuvent aussi développer des cancers.
Notre hypothèse était que certaines des plantes dont ils se nourrissent contribuent à les maintenir en bonne santé et que cela pourrait servir à l’élaboration de médicaments pour les humains.
Nous avons analysé environ 132 extraits issus de 27 plantes choisies selon :
La fréquence à laquelle elles sont consommées
Le temps alloué à leur consommation
La quantité consommée
Nous avons testé la capacité de ces plantes à prévenir le cancer et à inhiber la destruction des cellules, le développement des bactéries et des mycoses. Nous avons également analysé leurs apports nutritionnels.
Un régime préventif
Certaines des plantes que nous avons analysées sont déjà utilisées par les humains comme plantes médicinales. Cependant les parties utilisées pour les traitements sont différentes de celles mangées par les chimpanzés.Nauclea diderrichii est un bon exemple. Les fruits et les feuilles de cette plante sont consommés par les chimpanzés, mais l’écorce de la tige est utilisée par les hommes pour traiter la fièvre et la jaunisse.
Des plantes prometteuses telles que Tristemma coronatum, dont l’extrait des feuilles est connu pour son effet soporifique chez l’homme et Beilschmiedia mannii, qui est utilisée pour traiter des maladies pulmonaires ont été identifiées.
Les feuilles de Tristemma coronatum sont connues pour leur effet soporifique. Author provided.
Parmi les autres plantes bénéfiques, identifiées ici sous leur nom latin et leurs noms usuels dans les dialectes ivoiriens, citons :
Klainedoxa gabonensis (kroma)
Nauclea diderrichii (badi)
Manniophyton fulvum (kolomodia, frafrabié, topué, dobuï,zohé, zoobo)
Beilschmiedia mannii (biliè, tienabi, atiokwo, iréklé, biétou, btei, bhoukéssou)
Toutes poussent en abondance dans le parc National de Taï.
Notre étude a montré que les plantes analysées induisent une enzyme, la quinone réductase, qui prévient les dommages des cellules du corps. Ces plantes inhibent le NF-kB, une enzyme dont l’activation est à l’origine de plus de 20 % de tous les cas des cancer rapportés.
Vingt-quatre extraits (18 %) de ces plantes éliminent les bactéries et six (5 %) détruisent les levures à l’origine des candidoses. Tristemma coronatum a une activité à la fois sur les bactéries et les levures tandis que Beilschmiedia mannii est efficace contre les bactéries, les levures et le cancer, ce qui signifie que ces plantes pourraient donc être utilisées pour chez l’homme pour les soins de santé.
Ecrasé et mélangé à du carbonate de calcium, le fruit de la Klainedoxa Kabonensis est utilisé pour soigner les abcès et les ulcères. La pulpe est appliquée sur les inflammations. Author provided.
Développement de nouveaux médicaments
Notre étude démontre le potentiel thérapeutique et nutritionnel de certaines plantes, qui peut être pris en considération dans l’élaboration de nouveaux médicaments.
La prochaine étape sera de tester ces plantes sur des animaux de laboratoire. Une fois leur innocuité et leur efficacité démontrées, nous pourrons évaluer leurs effets sur des humains. Si elles remplissent les conditions nécessaires, le développement de nouveaux médicaments pourra suivre.

"La population du continent africain s’accroît rapidement. Estimée à 140 millions en 1900, elle atteignait un milliard d’habitants en 2010. Elle en comptera 2,5 en 2050 et plus de 4 en 2100, selon le scénario moyen des projections des Nations unies (voir la figure ci-dessous). Un humain sur 6 habite aujourd’hui en Afrique. En 2050, ce sera 1 sur 4, et plus d’1 sur 3 en 2100, selon ces mêmes projections.
À quoi tient cette forte croissance ? Se poursuivra-t-elle ? Le quadruplement d’ici la fin du siècle est-il inévitable ?
Gilles Pison (à partir des données des Nations unies), CC BY
Les raisons de la croissance
Si la population de l’Afrique augmente, c’est en raison de l’excédent des naissances sur les décès (quatre fois plus de naissances que de décès). La mortalité a beau y être la plus élevée du monde, elle y a diminué, comme elle l’avait fait auparavant dans les autres continents.
La fécondité y a également diminué, les femmes y mettant au monde 4,5 enfants en moyenne chacune en 2017, contre plus de 6,5 il y a quarante ans et 5,5 il y a vingt ans. L’Afrique connaît là aussi une évolution ayant déjà eu lieu dans les autres continents, où elle y est plus avancée : 2,1 enfants seulement par femme en Asie en 2017, 2,0 en Amérique latine, 1,9 en Amérique du Nord et 1,6 en Europe.
Cette moindre mortalité qu’autrefois et cette fécondité encore relativement élevée expliquent que la population de l’Afrique s’accroisse rapidement. Même si la fécondité continue de diminuer, comme le suppose le scénario moyen des Nations unies, il ne va pas en résulter tout de suite une diminution sensible du taux de croissance et encore moins un arrêt de celle-ci, en raison de l’inertie démographique.
À supposer que la fécondité africaine tombe dès maintenant à 1,6 enfant par femme comme en Europe ou en Chine – scénario hautement improbable –, la population continuerait pourtant d’augmenter pendant encore quelques décennies pour atteindre près de 1,6 milliard en 2050. La population de l’Afrique comprend en effet beaucoup de jeunes adultes en âge d’avoir des enfants ; même si chacun en avait peu, il en résulterait un nombre élevé de naissances.
L’évolution de la fécondité : plusieurs surprises récentes
Les projections de population publiées par les Nations unies en 1981 annonçaient 10,5 milliards d’êtres humains sur la planète en 2100 dans leur scénario moyen. Les dernières projections publiées en juin 2017 en annoncent 11,2, soit 0,7 de plus.
Le total est donc un peu plus élevé mais le véritable changement se trouve dans la répartition par continent : l’Asie, 5,9 milliards d’habitants en 2100 d’après la projection publiée en 1981, n’en a plus que 4,8 à cet horizon dans celle publiée en 2017. La révision est également à la baisse pour l’Amérique latine : 712 millions en 2100 au lieu de 1 187 (40 % de moins). À l’inverse, l’Afrique, 2,2 milliards d’habitants en 2100 d’après les projections de 1981, en a le double, 4,4 milliards, dans celles publiées en 2017 (voir la figure ci-dessous).
Première surprise : les enquêtes révèlent il y a 30 à 40 ans que la fécondité a commencé à baisser très rapidement dans beaucoup de pays d’Asie et d’Amérique latine. Les Nations unies ont donc revu sensiblement à la baisse leurs projections démographiques pour ces continents.
Autre surprise, plus récente, venue de l’Afrique intertropicale : on s’attendait à ce que sa fécondité baisse plus tardivement qu’en Asie et en Amérique latine, du fait de son retard en matière de développement socio-économique, mais on imaginait un simple décalage dans le temps, avec un rythme de baisse similaire aux autres régions du Sud une fois qu’elle serait engagée. C’est bien ce qui s’est passé en Afrique du Nord et en Afrique australe, mais pas en Afrique intertropicale où la baisse de la fécondité, bien qu’entamée aujourd’hui, s’y effectue plus lentement. D’où un relèvement des projections pour l’Afrique qui pourrait donc rassembler plus d’un habitant de la planète sur trois en 2100.

Ce qui se passe en Afrique intertropicale
La fécondité diminue bien en Afrique intertropicale mais dans les milieux instruits et en villes plus que dans les campagnes, où vit encore la majorité de la population. Plusieurs facteurs pourraient expliquer que la baisse de la fécondité y soit pour l’instant plus lente que celle observée il y a quelques décennies en Asie et en Amérique latine (voir la figure ci-dessous).
L’Afrique se développe sur le plan économique, mais lentement, et sans encore avoir atteint le niveau des pays asiatiques ou latino-américains à l’époque où leur fécondité a commencé à diminuer fortement.
Or le développement économique et la baisse de la fécondité vont souvent de pair, la seconde étant souvent considérée comme une conséquence du premier. L’instruction des femmes est un facteur-clé dans ce processus : celles ayant été à l’école mettent moins d’enfants au monde que celles qui n’y sont pas allées. Les pays asiatiques et latino-américains ont beaucoup investi dans l’éducation pour tous il y a quelques décennies. Si l’éducation progresse en Afrique intertropicale, notamment chez les femmes, elle n’atteint toujours pas les niveaux observés en Asie et en Amérique latine lorsque la baisse de la fécondité s’est enclenchée dans ces continents.
Un autre facteur évoqué pour expliquer cette moindre baisse de la fécondité en Afrique est le partage des coûts pour élever les enfants. En Afrique, une partie des enfants est élevée par d’autres adultes que les parents – un grand parent, un oncle, une tante – ceux-ci prenant en charge les frais pour les nourrir, les habiller et les envoyer à l’école. Partout dans le monde, les humains font progressivement le choix d’avoir peu d’enfants, investissant sur chacun d’eux pour leur assurer une vie longue et de qualité, ce qui n’est pas possible quand il y en a beaucoup. Mais si avoir un enfant de plus n’entraîne pas de dépenses accrues du fait qu’il sera pris en charge par d’autres, l’incitation à avoir peu d’enfants reste moindre.
Gilles Pison (à partir des données des Nations unies), CC BY
Des élites peu engagées dans la limitation des naissances
La fécondité baisse plus lentement en Afrique qu’en Asie et en Amérique latine il y a quelques décennies ; et cela ne vient pas d’un refus de la contraception chez les Africains.
La plupart des familles rurales ne se sont certes pas encore converties au modèle à deux enfants, mais elles souhaitent avoir moins d’enfants et notamment plus espacés. Elles sont prêtes pour cela à utiliser la contraception mais ne bénéficient pas de services adaptés pour y arriver.
Les programmes nationaux de limitation des naissances existent mais sont peu efficaces, manquent de moyens, et surtout souffrent d’un manque de motivation de leurs responsables et des personnels chargés de les mettre en œuvre sur le terrain. Parmi les rares exceptions, le Rwanda, l’Éthiopie, et le Malawi, pays où les autorités sont très engagées en faveur de la famille de petite taille et ont fait de la diminution de la fécondité une de leurs priorités.
Au Rwanda, celle-ci a connu l’une des plus fortes baisses du continent, y diminuant de plus de 20 % en une décennie (elle est passée de 5,4 enfants par femme au début des années 2000 à 4,2 au début des années 2010). Mais dans la plupart des autres pays d’Afrique intertropicale, les responsables et les élites ne sont pas persuadés de l’intérêt de limiter les naissances y compris au plus haut niveau de l’État, même si ce n’est pas le discours officiel tenus aux organisations internationales. C’est là encore l’une des différences avec l’Asie et l’Amérique latine des années 1960 et 1970.
La question du « dividende démographique »
Pour convaincre les gouvernements africains de faire de la limitation des naissances une de leurs priorités, les organisations internationales leur font miroiter un « dividende démographique ».
En effet, quand la fécondité chute rapidement dans un pays, la part des jeunes diminue fortement sans que la part des personnes âgées n’augmente sensiblement au début. En conséquence, la part de la population d’âge actif augmente beaucoup, offrant une opportunité au pays de se développer économiquement. Cette situation favorable ne dure qu’un moment. Quelques décennies après, les personnes d’âge actif très nombreuses ont vieilli et augmentent alors considérablement le poids de la population âgée.
On estime qu’un certain nombre de pays asiatiques, dont la Chine, ont bénéficié de ce dividende et qu’il a pu représenter jusqu’à 10 à 30 % de leur croissance économique. En revanche, les pays d’Amérique latine n’en auraient pas bénéficié pour la plupart, faute d’emplois créés en quantité suffisante pour occuper le surcroît de personnes d’âge actif.
Mais si l’Asie et l’Amérique latine se sont engagées dans la famille de petite taille, ce n’est pas en espérant bénéficier d’un dividende démographique – on n’en parlait pas à l’époque. Les gouvernements ont développé des politiques de limitation des naissances pour réduire la croissance de la population jugée trop rapide pour un bon développement du pays.
Dans le cas de l’Afrique, les conditions pour qu’un dividende démographique ait lieu ne sont pas réunies : la fécondité baisse à un rythme trop lent ; et à supposer qu’elle se mette à baisser rapidement, les perspectives de croissance des emplois sont modestes et ne permettront sans doute pas d’absorber la main d’œuvre supplémentaire. Au cas peu probable où il y aurait un dividende démographique, celui-ci n’est qu’une perspective lointaine, dans quelques décennies.
L’Afrique n’échappera pas à une multiplication par deux de sa population d’ici 2050 en raison de l’inertie démographique que nul ne peut empêcher. Selon son développement économique dans les prochaines années, la progression de l’instruction chez les femmes et les politiques en faveur de la famille de petite taille, en 2100, elle sera trois, quatre, cinq, ou six fois plus nombreuse qu’aujourd’hui.
